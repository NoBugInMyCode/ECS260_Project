An MLflow **Run** should be automatically created, which tracks the training dataset, hyper parameters, performance metrics, the trained model, dependencies, and even more.\n\n```\nmlflow ui\n```\n\n### Serving Models ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/deployment/index.html))\n\nYou can deploy the logged model to a local inference server by a one-line command using the MLflow CLI. Visit the documentation for how to deploy models to other hosting platforms.\n\n```bash\nmlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model\n```\n\n### Evaluating Models ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-evaluation/index.html))\n\nThe following example runs automatic evaluation for question-answering tasks with several built-in metrics.\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Evaluation set contains (1) input question (2) model outputs (3) ground truth\ndf = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        \"inputs\": [\"What is MLflow?\", \"What is Spark?\"],\n        \"outputs\": [\n            \"MLflow is an innovative fully self-driving airship powered by AI.\",\n            \"Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed in Los Angeles.\",\n        ],\n        \"ground_truth\": [\n            \"MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) \"\n            \"lifecycle.\",\n            \"Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for big data \"\n            \"processing and analytics.\",\n        ],\n    }\n)\neval_dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(\n    df, predictions=\"outputs\", targets=\"ground_truth\"\n)\n\n# Start an MLflow Run to record the evaluation results to\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"evaluate_qa\"):\n    # Run automatic evaluation with a set of built-in metrics for question-answering models\n    results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=eval_dataset,\n        model_type=\"question-answering\",\n    )\n\nprint(results.tables[\"eval_results_table\"])\n```\n\n### Observability ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html))\n\nMLflow Tracing provides LLM observability for various GenAI libraries such as OpenAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, AutoGen, and more. To enable auto-tracing, call `mlflow.xyz.autolog()` before running your models. Refer to the documentation for customization and manual instrumentation.\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\n# Enable tracing for OpenAI\nmlflow.openai.autolog()\n\n# Query OpenAI LLM normally\nresponse = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hi!\"}],\n    temperature=0.1,\n)\n```\n\nThen navigate to the \"Traces\" tab in the MLflow UI to find the trace records OpenAI query.\n\n## Community\n\n- For help or questions about MLflow usage (e.g. \"how do I do X?\") visit the [docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html)\n  or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\n- Alternatively, you can ask the question to our AI-powered chat bot. Visit the doc website and click on the **\"Ask AI\"** button at the right bottom to start chatting with the bot.\n- To report a bug, file a documentation issue, or submit a feature request, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/new/choose).\n- For release announcements and other discussions, please subscribe to our mailing list (mlflow-users@googlegroups.com)\n  or join us on [Slack](https://mlflow.org/slack).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe happily welcome contributions to MLflow! We are also seeking contributions to items on the\n[MLflow Roadmap](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/milestone/3).
