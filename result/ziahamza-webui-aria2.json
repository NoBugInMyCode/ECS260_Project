        "readme": "# WebUI-Aria2\n\n![Main interface](/screenshots/overview.png?raw=true)\n\nThe aim for this project is to create the worlds best and hottest interface to interact with aria2. aria2 is the worlds best file downloader, but sometimes the command line brings more power than necessary. The project was initially created as part of the GSOC scheme, however it has rapidly grown and changed with tremendous support and feedback from the aria2 community.\n\nVery simple to use, no build scripts, no installation scripts. First start aria2 in the background either in your local machine or in a remote one. You can do that as follows:\n\n```bash\naria2c --enable-rpc --rpc-listen-all\n```\n\nIf aria2 is not installed in your local machine then head on to https://aria2.github.io/ and follow the instructions there.\n\nThen to use the WebUI-Aria2,\n\n- You can either download this repository and open index.html from `docs` folder.\n- Or you could just head on to https://ziahamza.github.io/webui-aria2 and start downloading files! Once you have visited the URL thanks to [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) you can open the same URL even when you are offline.\n- Or you can also use NodeJS to create simple server by using the following command from the project folder.\n\n```bash\nnode node-server.js\n```\n\n# Tips\n\n1. You can always select which files to download in case of torrents or metalinks. Just pause a download and a list icon should appear next to the settings button. To select which files to download before starting the download, give the flag --pause-metadata to aria2. See [link](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption--pause-metadata)\n\n# Configuration\n\nRead and edit [configuration.js](src/js/services/configuration.js).\n\n## DirectURL\n\nThis feature allows users to download files that they download from aria2 directly from the webui dashboard. If you are familiar with how webservers work, setup a http server that points at the configured aria2 download directory, check permissions. Then Specify a full url: `http://server:port/` in the webui directURL configuration.\n\nIf the above is not obvious, keep reading what this is about in [directurl.md](directurl.md)\n\n# Dependencies\n\nWell, you need aria2. And a web browser (if that even counts!)\n\n# Docker support\n\nThere is two Dockerfile in this project, one is a common Dockerfile, which can be use for **testing purpose**.<br>\nThe second is a **production ready** Dockerfile for arm32v7 platforms (including Raspberry Pi).\n\n### For testing purpose\n\nYou can also try or use webui-aria2 in your LAN inside a Docker sandbox.\n\nBuild the image\n\n```bash\nsudo docker build -t yourname/webui-aria2 .\n```\n\n..and run it! It will be available at: `http://localhost:9100`\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run -v /Downloads:/data -p 6800:6800 -p 9100:8080 --name=\"webui-aria2\" yourname/webui-aria2\n```\n\n`/Downloads` is the directory in the host where you want to keep the downloaded files\n\n### Production ready (ARM platform)\n\nThis image contains both aria2 and webui-aria2.\n\nBuild it (may take several hours due to the aria2 compilation process. Don't panic and grab a coffee).\n\n```\ndocker build -f Dockerfile.arm32v7 -t yourname/webui-aria2 .\n```\n\nThis command will ends up building three images:\n\n- The first one is just about compiling aria2 and goreman binaries. It MUST be deleted each time the `ARIA2_VERSION` is changed in the Dockerfile, otherwise you won't benefit from the update.\n- The second is about building and downloading some go dependencies (goreman and gosu).\n- The second one is the acutal aria2 container, the one you must use.\n\n<br />\nPrepare the host volume:\nThis image required few file to be mounted in the container.\n```\n/home/aria/aria2/session.txt  (empty file)\n/home/aria/aria2/aria2.log    (empty file)\n/home/aria/aria2/aria2.conf   (aria2 configuration file, not webui-aria2 conf) must contains at least `enable-rpc=true` and `rpc-listen-all=true`\n/data/downloads/        (where the downloaded files goes)\n```\n\nRun it\n\n```\ndocker run --restart=always \\\n        -v /home/<USER>/data/aria2/downloads:/data/downloads \\\n        -v /home/<USER>/data/aria2/.aria2:/home/aria/.aria2 \\\n        -p 6800:6800 -p 9100:8080 \\\n        --name=\"webui-aria2\" \\\n        -d yourname/webui-aria2\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nCheckout [contributor's guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to know more about how to contribute to this project.\n\n# Deploy to Heroku\n\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\n\n# Support\n\nFor any support, feature request and bug report add an issue in the github project. [link](https://github.com/ziahamza/webui-aria2/issues)\n\n# License\n\nRefer to the LICENSE file (MIT License). If the more liberal license is needed then add it as an issue\n",
