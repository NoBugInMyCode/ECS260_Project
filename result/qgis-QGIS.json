QGIS Server\n\nHeadless map server -- running on Linux, macOS, Windows, or in a docker container -- that shares the same code base as QGIS.\n\n- Industry-standard protocols (WMS, WFS, WFS3/OGC API for Features and WCS) allow plug-n-play with any software stack\n- Works with any web server (Apache, nginx, etc) or standalone\n- All beautiful QGIS cartography is supported with best-in-class support for printing\n- Fully customizable with Python scripting support\n\n*Example: QGIS server WMS response*\n\n![Example: QGIS Server response to a WMS request](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/_images/server_selection_parameter.png \"QGIS Server response to a WMS request\")\n\n*Example: QGIS server WFS response*\n\n![Example: QGIS Server response to a WFS Feature request](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/_images/server_wfs3_feature.png \"QGIS Server response to a WFS Feature request\")\n\n## Under the hood\n\nQGIS is developed using the [Qt toolkit](https://qt.io) and C++, since 2002, and has a pleasing, easy to use graphical\nuser interface with multilingual support. It is maintained by an active developer team and supported by vibrant\ncommunity of GIS professionals and enthusiasts as well as geospatial data publishers and end-users.\n\n### Versions and release cycle\n\nQGIS development and releases follow a [time based schedule/roadmap](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html). There are three main branches of QGIS that users can install. These are the **Long Term Release (LTR)** branch, the **Latest Release (LR)** branch, and the **Development (Nightly)** branch.\n\nEvery month, there is a **Point Release** that provides bug-fixes to the LTR and LR.\n\n### Free and Open Source\n\nQGIS is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) Version 2 or any later version.\nDeveloping QGIS under this license means that you can (if you want to) inspect\nand modify the source code and guarantees that you, our happy user will always\nhave access to a GIS program that is free of cost and can be freely\nmodified.\n\nQGIS is part of the Open-Source Geospatial Foundation ([OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/)), offering a range of complementary open-source GIS software projects.\n\n## Installing and using QGIS\n\nPrecompiled binaries for QGIS are available at [the QGIS.org download page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).\nPlease follow the installation instructions carefully.\n\nThe [building guide](INSTALL.md) can be used to get started with building QGIS from source.\n\nFor installation of QGIS Server, see its [getting started documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/server_manual/getting_started.html).\n\n### Documentation\n\nA range of [documentation](https://qgis.org/resources/hub/#documentation) is available. This includes:\n\n- [Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)\n- [QGIS User Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/index.html)\n- [QGIS Server Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/server_manual/index.html)\n- [Visual Changelog](https://qgis.org/project/visual-changelogs/)\n- [Documentation Guidelines](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/documentation_guidelines/index.html)\n- [QGIS Python (PyQGIS) Cookbook](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html)\n- [QGIS Python (PyQGIS) API](https://qgis.org/pyqgis/)\n- [QGIS C++ API](https://qgis.org/api/)\n- [Developers Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/developers_guide/index.html)\n\n### Help and support channels\n\nThere are several channels where you can find help and support for QGIS:\n\n- Using the [QGIS community site](https://qgis.org)\n- Joining the [qgis-users mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-user)\n- Chatting with other users real-time. *Please wait around for a response to your question as many folks on the channel are doing other things and it may take a while for them to notice your question. The following paths all take you to the same chat room:*\n    - Using an IRC client and joining the\n      [#qgis](https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#qgis) channel on irc.libera.chat.\n    - Using a Matrix client and joining the [#qgis:osgeo.org](https://matrix.to/#/#qgis:osgeo.org) room.\n - At the [GIS stackexchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) or [r/QGIS reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/QGIS/), which are not maintained by the QGIS team, but where the QGIS and broader GIS community provides lots of advice\n- [Other support channels](https://qgis.org/resources/support/)\n\n## Get involved with the community\n\n[Contribution guidelines for this project](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n",
