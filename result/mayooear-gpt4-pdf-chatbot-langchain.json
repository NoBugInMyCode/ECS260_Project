LangChain is a framework that makes it easier to build scalable AI/LLM apps and chatbots. Pinecone is a vectorstore for storing embeddings and your PDF in text to later retrieve similar docs.\n\n[Tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih9PBGVVOO4)\n\n[Join the discord if you have questions](https://discord.gg/E4Mc77qwjm)\n\nThe visual guide of this repo and tutorial is in the `visual guide` folder.\n\n**If you run into errors, please review the troubleshooting section further down this page.**\n\nPrelude: Please make sure you have already downloaded node on your system and the version is 18 or greater.\n\n## Development\n\n1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP\n\n```\ngit clone [github https url]\n```\n\n2. Install packages\n\nFirst run `npm install yarn -g` to install yarn globally (if you haven't already).\n\nThen run:\n\n```\nyarn install\n```\n\nAfter installation, you should now see a `node_modules` folder.\n\n3. Set up your `.env` file\n\n- Copy `.env.example` into `.env`\n  Your `.env` file should look like this:\n\n```\nOPENAI_API_KEY=\n\nPINECONE_API_KEY=\nPINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=\n\nPINECONE_INDEX_NAME=\n\n```\n\n- Visit [openai](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) to retrieve API keys and insert into your `.env` file.\n- Visit [pinecone](https://pinecone.io/) to create and retrieve your API keys, and also retrieve your environment and index name from the dashboard.\n\n4. In the `config` folder, replace the `PINECONE_NAME_SPACE` with a `namespace` where you'd like to store your embeddings on Pinecone when you run `npm run ingest`. This namespace will later be used for queries and retrieval.\n\n5. In `utils/makechain.ts` chain change the `QA_PROMPT` for your own usecase. Change `modelName` in `new OpenAI` to `gpt-4`, if you have access to `gpt-4` api. Please verify outside this repo that you have access to `gpt-4` api, otherwise the application will not work.\n\n## Convert your PDF files to embeddings\n\n**This repo can load multiple PDF files**\n\n1. Inside `docs` folder, add your pdf files or folders that contain pdf files.\n\n2. Run the script `yarn run ingest` to 'ingest' and embed your docs. If you run into errors troubleshoot below.\n\n3. Check Pinecone dashboard to verify your namespace and vectors have been added.\n\n## Run the app\n\nOnce you've verified that the embeddings and content have been successfully added to your Pinecone, you can run the app `npm run dev` to launch the local dev environment, and then type a question in the chat interface.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIn general, keep an eye out in the `issues` and `discussions` section of this repo for solutions.\n\n**General errors**\n\n- Make sure you're running the latest Node version. Run `node -v`\n- Try a different PDF or convert your PDF to text first. It's possible your PDF is corrupted, scanned, or requires OCR to convert to text.\n- `Console.log` the `env` variables and make sure they are exposed.\n- Make sure you're using the same versions of LangChain and Pinecone as this repo.\n- Check that you've created an `.env` file that contains your valid (and working) API keys, environment and index name.\n- If you change `modelName` in `OpenAI`, make sure you have access to the api for the appropriate model.\n- Make sure you have enough OpenAI credits and a valid card on your billings account.\n- Check that you don't have multiple OPENAPI keys in your global environment. If you do, the local `env` file from the project will be overwritten by systems `env` variable.\n- Try to hard code your API keys into the `process.env` variables if there are still issues.\n\n**Pinecone errors**\n\n- Make sure your pinecone dashboard `environment` and `index` matches the one in the `pinecone.ts` and `.env` files.\n- Check that you've set the vector dimensions to `1536`.\n- Make sure your pinecone namespace is in lowercase.\n- Pinecone indexes of users on the Starter(free) plan are deleted after 7 days of inactivity. To prevent this, send an API request to Pinecone to reset the counter before 7 days.\n- Retry from scratch with a new Pinecone project, index, and cloned repo.\n\n## Credit\n\nFrontend of this repo is inspired by [langchain-chat-nextjs](https://github.com/zahidkhawaja/langchain-chat-nextjs)\n",
