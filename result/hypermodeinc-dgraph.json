It provides\nACID transactions, consistent replication, and linearizable reads. It's built from the ground up to\nperform a rich set of queries. Being a native GraphQL database, it tightly controls how the data is\narranged on disk to optimize for query performance and throughput, reducing disk seeks and network\ncalls in a cluster.\n\nDgraph's goal is to provide Google production-level scale and throughput, with low enough latency to\nserve real-time user queries over terabytes of structured data. Dgraph supports\n[GraphQL query syntax](https://dgraph.io/docs/main/query-language/), and responds in\n[JSON](http://www.json.org/) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)\nover [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) and HTTP. Dgraph is written using the Go Programming Language.\n\n## Status\n\nDgraph is at [version v24.0.5][rel] and is production-ready. Apart from the vast open source\ncommunity, it is being used in production at multiple Fortune 500 companies, and by\n[Intuit Katlas](https://github.com/intuit/katlas) and\n[VMware Purser](https://github.com/vmware/purser). A hosted version of Dgraph is available at\n[https://cloud.dgraph.io](https://cloud.dgraph.io).\n\n[rel]: https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/releases/tag/v24.0.5\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nDgraph officially supports the Linux/amd64 architecture. Support for Linux/arm64 is in development.\nIn order to take advantage of memory performance gains and other architecture-specific advancements\nin Linux, we dropped official support Mac and Windows in 2021, see\n[this blog post](https://discuss.dgraph.io/t/dropping-support-for-windows-and-mac/12913) for more\ninformation. You can still build and use Dgraph on other platforms (for live or bulk loading for\ninstance), but support for platforms other than Linux/amd64 is not available.\n\nRunning Dgraph in a Docker environment is the recommended testing and deployment method.\n\n## Install with Docker\n\nIf you're using Docker, you can use the\n[official Dgraph image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dgraph/dgraph/).\n\n```bash\ndocker pull dgraph/dgraph:latest\n```\n\nFor more information on a variety Docker deployment methods including Docker Compose and Kubernetes,\nsee the [docs](https://dgraph.io/docs/installation/single-host-setup/#docker).\n\n## Run a Quick Standalone Cluster\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -v ~/dgraph:/dgraph dgraph/standalone:latest\n```\n\n## Install from Source\n\nIf you want to install from source, install Go 1.19+ or later and the following dependencies:\n\n### Ubuntu\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n```\n\n### Build and Install\n\nThen clone the Dgraph repository and use `make install` to install the Dgraph binary in the\ndirectory named by the GOBIN environment variable, which defaults to $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin if\nthe GOPATH environment variable is not set.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph.git\ncd dgraph\nmake install\n```\n\n## Get Started\n\n**To get started with Dgraph, follow:**\n\n- Installation to queries in 3 steps via [dgraph.io/docs/](https://dgraph.io/docs/get-started/).\n- A longer interactive tutorial via [dgraph.io/tour/](https://dgraph.io/tour/).\n- Tutorial and presentation videos on\n  [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghE41LR8nkKFlR3IFTRO4w/featured).\n\n## Is Dgraph the right choice for me?\n\n- Do you have more than 10 SQL tables connected via foreign keys?\n- Do you have sparse data, which doesn't elegantly fit into SQL tables?\n- Do you want a simple and flexible schema, which is readable and maintainable over time?\n- Do you care about speed and performance at scale?\n\nIf the answers to the above are YES, then Dgraph would be a great fit for your application. Dgraph\nprovides NoSQL like scalability while providing SQL like transactions and the ability to select,\nfilter, and aggregate data points. It combines that with distributed joins, traversals, and graph\noperations, which makes it easy to build applications with it.\n\n## Dgraph compared to other graph DBs\n\n| Features                            | Dgraph                        | Neo4j                                                    | Janus Graph                           |\n| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| Architecture                        | Sharded and Distributed       | Single server (+ replicas in enterprise)                 | Layer on top of other distributed DBs |\n| Replication                         | Consistent                    | None in community edition (only available in enterprise) | Via underlying DB                     |\n| Data movement for shard rebalancing | Automatic                     | Not applicable (all data lies on each server)            | Via underlying DB                     |\n| Language                            | GraphQL inspired              | Cypher, Gremlin                                          | Gremlin                               |\n| Protocols                           | Grpc / HTTP + JSON / RDF      | Bolt + Cypher                                            | Websocket / HTTP                      |\n| Transactions                        | Distributed ACID transactions | Single server ACID transactions                          | Not typically ACID                    |\n| Full-Text Search                    | Native support                | Native support                                           | Via External Indexing System          |\n| Regular Expressions                 | Native support                | Native support                                           | Via External Indexing System          |\n| Geo Search                          | Native support                | External support only                                    | Via External Indexing System          |\n| License                             | Apache 2.0                    | GPL v3                                                   | Apache 2.0                            |\n\n## Users\n\n- **Dgraph official documentation is present at [dgraph.io/docs/](https://dgraph.io/docs/).**\n- For feature requests or questions, visit [https://discuss.dgraph.io](https://discuss.dgraph.io).\n- Check out [the demo at dgraph.io](http://dgraph.io) and\n  [the visualization at play.dgraph.io](http://play.dgraph.io/).\n- Please see [releases tab](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/releases) to find the latest\n  release and corresponding release notes.\n- [See the Roadmap](https://discuss.dgraph.io/t/product-roadmap-2020/8479) for a list of working and\n  planned features.\n- Read about the latest updates from the Dgraph team [on our blog](https://open.dgraph.io/).\n- Watch tech talks on our\n  [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghE41LR8nkKFlR3IFTRO4w/featured).\n\n## Developers\n\n- See a list of issues\n  [that we need help with](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).\n- Please see\n  [Contributing to Dgraph](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for\n  guidelines on contributions.\n\n## Client Libraries\n\nThe Dgraph team maintains several\n[officially supported client libraries](https://dgraph.io/docs/clients/).
