The code snippet does not require you to include confidential information. However, it must provide enough information so the problem can be replicable, or it may be closed without an explanation.\n\n\n## Version Compatibility\n\n_Please upgrade to atleast v5.0.0 to avoid security issues mentioned below._\n\n| Node Version   |   Bcrypt Version  |\n| -------------- | ------------------|\n| 0.4            | <= 0.4            |\n| 0.6, 0.8, 0.10 | >= 0.5            |\n| 0.11           | >= 0.8            |\n| 4              | <= 2.1.0          |\n| 8              | >= 1.0.3 < 4.0.0  |\n| 10, 11         | >= 3              |\n| 12 onwards     | >= 3.0.6          |\n\n`node-gyp` only works with stable/released versions of node. Since the `bcrypt` module uses `node-gyp` to build and install, you'll need a stable version of node to use bcrypt. If you do not, you'll likely see an error that starts with:\n\n```\ngyp ERR! stack Error: \"pre\" versions of node cannot be installed, use the --nodedir flag instead\n```\n\n## Security Issues And Concerns\n\n> Per bcrypt implementation, only the first 72 bytes of a string are used. Any extra bytes are ignored when matching passwords. Note that this is not the first 72 *characters*. It is possible for a string to contain less than 72 characters, while taking up more than 72 bytes (e.g. a UTF-8 encoded string containing emojis). If a string is provided, it will be encoded using UTF-8.\n\nAs should be the case with any security tool, anyone using this library should scrutinise it. If you find or suspect an issue with the code, please bring it to the maintainers' attention. We will spend some time ensuring that this library is as secure as possible.\n\nHere is a list of BCrypt-related security issues/concerns that have come up over the years.\n\n* An [issue with passwords][jtr] was found with a version of the Blowfish algorithm developed for John the Ripper. This is not present in the OpenBSD version and is thus not a problem for this module. HT [zooko][zooko].\n* Versions `< 5.0.0` suffer from bcrypt wrap-around bug and _will truncate passwords >= 255 characters leading to severely weakened passwords_. Please upgrade at  earliest. See [this wiki page][wrap-around-bug] for more details.\n* Versions `< 5.0.0` _do not handle NUL characters inside passwords properly leading to all subsequent characters being dropped and thus resulting in severely weakened passwords_. Please upgrade at earliest. See [this wiki page][improper-nuls] for more details.\n\n## Compatibility Note\n\nThis library supports `$2a$` and `$2b$` prefix bcrypt hashes. `$2x$` and `$2y$` hashes are specific to bcrypt implementation developed for John the Ripper. In theory, they should be compatible with `$2b$` prefix.\n\nCompatibility with hashes generated by other languages is not 100% guaranteed due to difference in character encodings. However, it should not be an issue for most cases.\n\n### Migrating from v1.0.x\n\nHashes generated in earlier version of `bcrypt` remain 100% supported in `v2.x.x` and later versions. In most cases, the migration should be a bump in the `package.json`.\n\nHashes generated in `v2.x.x` using the defaults parameters will not work in earlier versions.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* NodeJS\n* `node-gyp`\n * Please check the dependencies for this tool at: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp\n  * Windows users will need the options for c# and c++ installed with their visual studio instance.\n  * Python 2.x/3.x\n* `OpenSSL` - This is only required to build the `bcrypt` project if you are using versions <= 0.7.7. Otherwise, we're using the builtin node crypto bindings for seed data (which use the same OpenSSL code paths we were, but don't have the external dependency).\n\n## Install via NPM\n\n```\nnpm install bcrypt\n```\n***Note:*** OS X users using Xcode 4.3.1 or above may need to run the following command in their terminal prior to installing if errors occur regarding xcodebuild: ```sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer```\n\n_Pre-built binaries for various NodeJS versions are made available on a best-effort basis._\n\nOnly the current stable and supported LTS releases are actively tested against.\n\n_There may be an interval between the release of the module and the availabilty of the compiled modules._\n\nCurrently, we have pre-built binaries that support the following platforms:\n\n1. Windows x32 and x64\n2. Linux x64 (GlibC and musl)\n3. macOS\n\nIf you face an error like this:\n\n```\nnode-pre-gyp ERR! Tried to download(404): https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/releases/download/v1.0.2/bcrypt_lib-v1.0.2-node-v48-linux-x64.tar.gz\n```\n\nmake sure you have the appropriate dependencies installed and configured for your platform. You can find installation instructions for the dependencies for some common platforms [in this page][depsinstall].\n\n## Usage\n\n### async (recommended)\n\n```javascript\nconst bcrypt = require('bcrypt');\nconst saltRounds = 10;\nconst myPlaintextPassword = 's0/\\/\\P4$$w0rD';\nconst someOtherPlaintextPassword = 'not_bacon';\n```\n\n#### To hash a password:\n\nTechnique 1 (generate a salt and hash on separate function calls):\n\n```javascript\nbcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds, function(err, salt) {\n    bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, salt, function(err, hash) {\n        // Store hash in your password DB.\n    });\n});\n```\n\nTechnique 2 (auto-gen a salt and hash):\n\n```javascript\nbcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {\n    // Store hash in your password DB.\n});\n```\n\nNote that both techniques achieve the same end-result.\n\n#### To check a password:\n\n```javascript\n// Load hash from your password DB.\nbcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash, function(err, result) {\n    // result == true\n});\nbcrypt.compare(someOtherPlaintextPassword, hash, function(err, result) {\n    // result == false\n});\n```\n\n[A Note on Timing Attacks](#a-note-on-timing-attacks)\n\n### with promises\n\nbcrypt uses whatever `Promise` implementation is available in `global.Promise`. NodeJS >= 0.12 has a native `Promise` implementation built in. However, this should work in any Promises/A+ compliant implementation.\n\nAsync methods that accept a callback, return a `Promise` when callback is not specified if Promise support is available.\n\n```javascript\nbcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds).then(function(hash) {\n    // Store hash in your password DB.\n});\n```\n```javascript\n// Load hash from your password DB.\nbcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash).then(function(result) {\n    // result == true\n});\nbcrypt.compare(someOtherPlaintextPassword, hash).then(function(result) {\n    // result == false\n});\n```\n\nThis is also compatible with `async/await`\n\n```javascript\nasync function checkUser(username, password) {\n    //... fetch user from a db etc.\n\n    const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash);\n\n    if(match) {\n        //login\n    }\n\n    //...\n}\n```\n\n### ESM import\n```javascript\nimport bcrypt from \"bcrypt\";\n\n// later\nawait bcrypt.compare(password, hash);\n```\n\n### sync\n\n```javascript\nconst bcrypt = require('bcrypt');\nconst saltRounds = 10;\nconst myPlaintextPassword = 's0/\\/\\P4$$w0rD';\nconst someOtherPlaintextPassword = 'not_bacon';\n```\n\n#### To hash a password:\n\nTechnique 1 (generate a salt and hash on separate function calls):\n\n```javascript\nconst salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync(saltRounds);\nconst hash = bcrypt.hashSync(myPlaintextPassword, salt);\n// Store hash in your password DB.\n```\n\nTechnique 2 (auto-gen a salt and hash):\n\n```javascript\nconst hash = bcrypt.hashSync(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds);\n// Store hash in your password DB.\n```\n\nAs with async, both techniques achieve the same end-result.\n\n#### To check a password:\n\n```javascript\n// Load hash from your password DB.\nbcrypt.compareSync(myPlaintextPassword, hash); // true\nbcrypt.compareSync(someOtherPlaintextPassword, hash); // false\n```\n\n[A Note on Timing Attacks](#a-note-on-timing-attacks)\n\n### Why is async mode recommended over sync mode?\nWe recommend using async API if you use `bcrypt` on a server. Bcrypt hashing is CPU intensive which will cause the sync APIs to block the event loop and prevent your application from servicing any inbound requests or events. The async version uses a thread pool which does not block the main event loop.\n\n## API\n\n`BCrypt.`\n\n  * `genSaltSync(rounds, minor)`\n    * `rounds` - [OPTIONAL] - the cost of processing the data. (default - 10)\n    * `minor` - [OPTIONAL] - minor version of bcrypt to use. (default - b)\n  * `genSalt(rounds, minor, cb)`\n    * `rounds` - [OPTIONAL] - the cost of processing the data.

The value you submit is not just the number of rounds the module will go through to hash your data. The module will use the value you enter and go through `2^rounds` hashing iterations.\n\nFrom @garthk, on a 2GHz core you can roughly expect:\n\n    rounds=8 : ~40 hashes/sec\n    rounds=9 : ~20 hashes/sec\n    rounds=10: ~10 hashes/sec\n    rounds=11: ~5  hashes/sec\n    rounds=12: 2-3 hashes/sec\n    rounds=13: ~1 sec/hash\n    rounds=14: ~1.5 sec/hash\n    rounds=15: ~3 sec/hash\n    rounds=25: ~1 hour/hash\n    rounds=31: 2-3 days/hash\n\n\n## A Note on Timing Attacks\n\nBecause it's come up multiple times in this project and other bcrypt projects, it needs to be said. The `bcrypt` library is not susceptible to timing attacks. From codahale/bcrypt-ruby#42:\n\n> One of the desired properties of a cryptographic hash function is preimage attack resistance, which means there is no shortcut for generating a message which, when hashed, produces a specific digest.\n\nA great thread on this, in much more detail can be found @ codahale/bcrypt-ruby#43\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with timing attacks and want to learn more you can find a great writeup @ [A Lesson In Timing Attacks][timingatk]\n\nHowever, timing attacks are real. And the comparison function is _not_ time safe. That means that it may exit the function early in the comparison process. Timing attacks happen because of the above. We don't need to be careful that an attacker will learn anything, and our comparison function provides a comparison of hashes. It is a utility to the overall purpose of the library. If you end up using it for something else, we cannot guarantee the security of the comparator. Keep that in mind as you use the library.\n\n## Hash Info\n\nThe characters that comprise the resultant hash are `./ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789$`.\n\nResultant hashes will be 60 characters long and they will include the salt among other parameters, as follows:\n\n`$[algorithm]$[cost]$[salt][hash]`\n\n- 2 chars hash algorithm identifier prefix. `\"$2a$\" or \"$2b$\"` indicates BCrypt\n- Cost-factor (n). Represents the exponent used to determine how many iterations 2^n\n- 16-byte (128-bit) salt, base64 encoded to 22 characters\n- 24-byte (192-bit) hash, base64 encoded to 31 characters\n\nExample:\n```\n$2b$10$nOUIs5kJ7naTuTFkBy1veuK0kSxUFXfuaOKdOKf9xYT0KKIGSJwFa\n |  |  |                     |\n |  |  |                     hash-value = K0kSxUFXfuaOKdOKf9xYT0KKIGSJwFa\n |  |  |\n |  |  salt = nOUIs5kJ7naTuTFkBy1veu\n |  |\n |  cost-factor => 10 = 2^10 rounds\n |\n hash-algorithm identifier => 2b = BCrypt\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nIf you create a pull request, tests better pass :)\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nThe code for this comes from a few sources:\n\n* blowfish.cc - OpenBSD\n* bcrypt.cc - OpenBSD\n* bcrypt::gen_salt - [gen_salt inclusion to bcrypt][bcryptgs]\n* bcrypt_node.cc - me\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [Antonio Salazar Cardozo][shadowfiend] - Early MacOS X support (when we used libbsd)\n* [Ben Glow][pixelglow] - Fixes for thread safety with async calls\n* [Van Nguyen][thegoleffect] - Found a timing attack in the comparator\n* [NewITFarmer][newitfarmer] - Initial Cygwin support\n* [David Trejo][dtrejo] - packaging fixes\n* [Alfred Westerveld][alfredwesterveld] - packaging fixes\n* [Vincent C\u00f4t\u00e9-Roy][vincentr] - Testing around concurrency issues\n* [Lloyd Hilaiel][lloyd] - Documentation fixes\n* [Roman Shtylman][shtylman] - Code refactoring, general rot reduction, compile options, better memory management with delete and new, and an upgrade to libuv over eio/ev.\n* [Vadim Graboys][vadimg] - Code changes to support 0.5.5+\n* [Ben Noordhuis][bnoordhuis] - Fixed a thread safety issue in nodejs that was perfectly mappable to this module.\n* [Nate Rajlich][tootallnate] - Bindings and build process.\n* [Sean McArthur][seanmonstar] - Windows Support\n* [Fanie Oosthuysen][weareu] - Windows Support\n* [Amitosh Swain Mahapatra][recrsn] - $2b$ hash support, ES6 Promise support\n* [Nicola Del Gobbo][NickNaso] - Initial implementation with N-API\n\n## License\nUnless stated elsewhere, file headers or otherwise, the license as stated in the LICENSE file.\n\n[bcryptwiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt\n[bcryptgs]: http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-crypto/2002/05/24/msg000204.html\n[codahale]: http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/\n[gh13]: https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/issues/13\n[jtr]: http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/20/2\n[depsinstall]: https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/wiki/Installation-Instructions\n[timingatk]: https://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/\n[wrap-around-bug]: https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/wiki/Security-Issues-and-Concerns#bcrypt-wrap-around-bug-medium-severity\n[improper-nuls]: https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/wiki/Security-Issues-and-Concerns#improper-nul-handling-medium-severity\n\n[shadowfiend]:https://github.com/Shadowfiend\n[thegoleffect]:https://github.com/thegoleffect\n[pixelglow]:https://github.com/pixelglow\n[dtrejo]:https://github.com/dtrejo\n[alfredwesterveld]:https://github.com/alfredwesterveld\n[newitfarmer]:https://github.com/newitfarmer\n[zooko]:https://twitter.com/zooko\n[vincentr]:https://twitter.com/vincentcr\n[lloyd]:https://github.com/lloyd\n[shtylman]:https://github.com/shtylman\n[vadimg]:https://github.com/vadimg\n[bnoordhuis]:https://github.com/bnoordhuis\n[tootallnate]:https://github.com/tootallnate\n[seanmonstar]:https://github.com/seanmonstar\n[weareu]:https://github.com/weareu\n[recrsn]:https://github.com/recrsn\n[NickNaso]: https://github.com/NickNaso\n",
