The development of\nMailpile is funded by\n[a large community of backers](https://www.mailpile.is/#community)\nand all code related to the project is and will be released under an OSI\napproved Free Software license.\n\nMailpile places great emphasis on providing a clean, elegant user\ninterface and pleasant user experience. In particular, Mailpile aims to\nmake it easy and convenient to receive and send PGP encrypted or signed\ne-mail.\n\nMailpile's primary user interface is web-based, but it also has a basic\ncommand-line interface and an API for developers. Using web technology\nfor the interface allows Mailpile to function both as a local desktop\napplication (accessed by visiting `localhost` in the browser) or a\nremote web-mail on a personal server or VPS.\n\nThe core of Mailpile is a fast search engine, custom written to deal\nwith large volumes of e-mail on consumer hardware. The search engine\nallows e-mail to be organized using tags (similar to GMail's labels) and\nthe application can be configured to automatically tag incoming mail\neither based on static rules or bayesian classifiers.\n\n\n### Trying Mailpile\n\nIf you need to run Mailpile v1 to access legacy data, consider using\nour [legacy Docker images](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile-v1-Docker).\n\n\n## Credits and License ##\n\nBjarni R. Einarsson (<http://bre.klaki.net/>) created this!  If you\nthink it's neat, you should also check out PageKite:\n<https://pagekite.net/>. [Sm\u00e1ri](<http://www.smarimccarthy.is/>) and\n[Brennan](https://brennannovak.com) joined the team in 2013 and made\nthis a real project (not just a toy search engine).\n\nThe original GMail team deserve a mention for their inspiring work:\nwishing the Free Software world had something like GMail is what\nmotivated Bjarni to start working on Mailpile. We would also like to\nthank Edward Snowden for inspiring us to try and make PGP usable for\njournalists and everday folks!\n\nContributors:\n\n- Bjarni R. Einarsson (<http://bre.klaki.net/>)\n- Brennan Novak (<https://brennannovak.com/>)\n- Smari McCarthy (<http://www.smarimccarthy.is/>)\n- Lots more, run `git shortlog -s` for a list! (Or check\n  [GitHub](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/graphs/contributors).)\n\nAnd of course, we couldn't do this without [our community of\nbackers](https://www.mailpile.is/#community).\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it\nunder the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.
