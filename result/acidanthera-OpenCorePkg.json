The primary purpose of the library set is to provide supplemental functionality for Apple-specific UEFI drivers. Key features:\n\n- Apple disk image loading support\n- Apple keyboard input aggregation\n- Apple PE image signature verification\n- Apple UEFI secure boot supplemental code\n- Audio management with screen reading support\n- Basic ACPI and SMBIOS manipulation\n- CPU information gathering with timer support\n- Cryptographic primitives (SHA-256, RSA, etc.)\n- Decompression primitives (zlib, lzss, lzvn, etc.)\n- Helper code for ACPI reads and modifications\n- Higher level abstractions for files, strings, UEFI variables\n- Overflow checking arithmetics\n- PE image loading with no UEFI Secure Boot conflict\n- Plist configuration format parsing\n- PNG image manipulation\n- Text output and graphics output implementations\n- XNU kernel driver injection and patch engine\n\nEarly history of the codebase could be found in [AppleSupportPkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleSupportPkg) and PicoLib library set by The HermitCrabs Lab.\n\n#### OcGuardLib\n\nThis library implements basic safety features recommended for the use within the project. It implements fast\nsafe integral arithmetics mapping on compiler builtins, type alignment checking, and UBSan runtime,\nbased on [NetBSD implementation](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/introduction_to_\u00b5ubsan_a_clean).\n\nThe use of UBSan runtime requires the use of Clang compiler and `-fsanitize=undefined` argument. Refer to\n[Clang documentation](https://releases.llvm.org/7.0.0/tools/clang/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html) for more\ndetails.\n\n#### Credits\n\n- The HermitCrabs Lab\n- All projects providing third-party code (refer to file headers)\n- [AppleLife](https://applelife.ru) team and user-contributed resources\n- Chameleon and Clover teams for hints and legacy\n- [al3xtjames](https://github.com/al3xtjames)\n- [Andrey1970AppleLife](https://github.com/Andrey1970AppleLife)\n- [mhaeuser (ex Download-Fritz)](https://github.com/mhaeuser)\n- [Goldfish64](https://github.com/Goldfish64)\n- [MikeBeaton](https://github.com/MikeBeaton)\n- [nms42](https://github.com/nms42)\n- [PMheart](https://github.com/PMheart)\n- [savvamitrofanov](https://github.com/savvamitrofanov)\n- [usr-sse2](https://github.com/usr-sse2)\n- [vit9696](https://github.com/vit9696)\n\n#### Discussion\n\nPlease refer to the following [list of OpenCore discussion forums](/Docs/FORUMS.md).\n",
