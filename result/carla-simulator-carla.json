CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and\nvalidation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings,\nvehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and\nenvironmental conditions.\n\n[![CARLA Video](Docs/img/carla_ue5_readme_img.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4V9GYjA1pE)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n> This is the development branch `ue5-dev` for the **Unreal Engine 5.5 version of CARLA**. This branch exists in parallel with the Unreal Engine 4.26 version of CARLA, in the `ue4-dev` branch. Please be sure that this version of CARLA is suitable for your needs as there are significant differences between the UE 5.5 and UE 4.26 versions of CARLA. \n\n### Recommended system\n\n* Intel i7 gen 9th - 11th / Intel i9 gen 9th - 11th / AMD Ryzen 7 / AMD Ryzen 9\n* +32 Gb RAM memory \n* NVIDIA RTX 3070/3080/3090 / NVIDIA RTX 4090 or better\n* 16 Gb or more VRAM\n* Ubuntu 22.04 or Windows 11\n\n >[!NOTE]\n> Ubuntu version 22.04 and Windows version 11 are required, the Unreal Engine 5.5 version of CARLA will not work on Ubuntu 20.04 or Windows 10 or lower. \n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [CARLA documentation](https://carla-ue5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is hosted on ReadTheDocs.

In order to access this repository, you must first link your GitHub account to Epic Games by following [this guide](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github). You then also need to use your git credentials to authorise the download of the Unreal Engine 5.5 repository. \n\n__Building in Linux__:\n\nRun the setup script from a terminal open in the CARLA root directory:\n\n```sh\ncd CarlaUE5\n./CarlaSetup.sh --interactive\n```\n\nThe setup script will prompt you for your sudo password, in order to install the prerequisites. It will then prompt you for your GitHub credentials in order to authorise the download of the Unreal Engine repository. \n\n__Building in Linux unattended__:\n\nIf you want to run the setup script unattended, your git credentials need to be stored in an environment variable. Add your github credentials to your `.bashrc` file:\n\n```sh\nexport GIT_LOCAL_CREDENTIALS=username@github_token\n```\n\nThen run the setup script using the following command:\n\n```sh\ncd CarlaUE5\nsudo -E ./CarlaSetup.sh\n```\n\nThis will download and install Unreal Engine 5.5, install the prerequisites and build CARLA. It may take some time to complete and use a significant amount of disk space.\n\nIf you prefer to add the git credentials in the terminal, use the following command:\n\n```sh\ncd CarlaUE5\nsudo -E env GIT_LOCAL_CREDENTIALS=github_username@github_token ./CarlaSetup.sh \n```\n\n__Building in Windows__:\n\nTo build in Windows, run the batch script:\n\n```sh\ncd CarlaUE5\nCarlaSetup.bat\n```\n\nUnattended mode is currently unavailable in Windows, you will need to enter GitHub credentials or administrator privileges when prompted.\n\n## Rebuilding CARLA\n\nOnce the setup is complete, you can execute subsequent builds with the following commands in a terminal open in the CARLA root directory. In Linux, run these commands in a standard terminal. In Windows, open the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2022.\n\n__Configure__:\n\nLinux:\n\n```sh\ncmake -G Ninja -S . -B Build --toolchain=$PWD/CMake/LinuxToolchain.cmake \\\n-DLAUNCH_ARGS=\"-prefernvidia\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_ROS2=ON\n```\n\nWindows:\n\n```sh\ncmake -G Ninja -S . -B Build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n```\n\n__Build__:\n\nLinux and Windows:\n\n```sh\ncmake --build Build\n```\n\n__Build and install the Python API__:\n\n\nLinux and windows:\n\n```sh\ncmake --build Build --target carla-python-api-install\n```\n\n__Launch the editor__:\n\n```sh\ncmake --build Build --target launch\n```\n\nFor more instructions on building CARLA UE5, please consult the build documentation for [Linux](https://carla-ue5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux_ue5/) or [Windows](https://carla-ue5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_windows_ue5/).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease take a look at our [Contribution guidelines][contriblink].\n\n[contriblink]: https://carla-ue5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cont_contribution_guidelines/\n\nLicenses\n-------\n\n## CARLA licenses\n\nCARLA specific code is distributed under the MIT License.\n\nCARLA specific assets are distributed under the CC-BY License.\n\n## CARLA Dependency and Integration licenses\n\nUnreal Engine 5 follows its [own license terms](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/faq).\n\nCARLA uses some dependencies related to 3rd party integrations:\n- [PROJ](https://proj.org/), a generic coordinate transformation software which uses the [X/MIT open source license](https://proj.org/about.html#license).\n- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org), part of the PROJ dependencies, which is [in the public domain](https://www.sqlite.org/purchase/license).\n- [Xerces-C](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/), a validating XML parser, which is made available under the [Apache Software License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\n- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), a C++ template library for linear algebra which uses the [MPL2 license](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).\n\nCARLA uses the Autodesk FBX SDK for converting FBX to OBJ in the import process of maps.
