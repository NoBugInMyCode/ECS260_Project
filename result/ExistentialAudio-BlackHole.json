To request a license [contact Existential Audio](mailto:devinroth@existential.audio).\n\n### Build & Install\nAfter building, to install BlackHole:\n\n1. Copy or move the built `BlackHoleXch.driver` bundle to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL`\n2. Restart CoreAudio using `sudo killall -9 coreaudiod`\n\n### Customizing BlackHole\n\nThe following pre-compiler constants may be used to easily customize a build of BlackHole.\n\n```\nkDriver_Name\nkPlugIn_BundleID\nkPlugIn_Icon\n\nkDevice_Name\nkDevice_IsHidden\nkDevice_HasInput\nkDevice_HasOutput\n\nkDevice2_Name\nkDevice2_IsHidden\nkDevice2_HasInput\nkDevice2_HasOutput\n\nkLatency_Frame_Size\nkNumber_Of_Channels\nkSampleRates\n```\n\nThey can be specified at build time with `xcodebuild` using `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`. \n\nExample:\n\n```bash\nxcodebuild \\\n  -project BlackHole.xcodeproj \\\n  GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS='$GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS kSomeConstant=value'\n```\n\nBe sure to escape any quotation marks when using strings. \n\n### Renaming BlackHole\n\nTo customize BlackHole it is required to change the following constants. \n- `kDriver_Name`\n- `kPlugIn_BundleID` (note that this must match the target bundleID)\n- `kPlugIn_Icon`\n\nThese can specified as pre-compiler constants using ```xcodebuild```.\n\n```bash\ndriverName=\"BlackHole\"\nbundleID=\"audio.existential.BlackHole\"\nicon=\"BlackHole.icns\"\n\nxcodebuild \\\n  -project BlackHole.xcodeproj \\\n  -configuration Release \\\n  PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER=$bundleID \\\n  GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS='$GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS\n  kDriver_Name=\\\"'$driverName'\\\"\n  kPlugIn_BundleID=\\\"'$bundleID'\\\"\n  kPlugIn_Icon=\\\"'$icon'\\\"'\n```\n\n### Customizing Channels, Latency, and Sample Rates\n\n`kNumber_Of_Channels` is used to set the number of channels. Be careful when specifying high channel counts. Although BlackHole is designed to be extremely efficient at higher channel counts it's possible that your computer might not be able to keep up. Sample rates play a roll as well. Don't use high sample rates with a high number of channels. Some applications don't know how to handle high channel counts. Proceed with caution.\n\n`kLatency_Frame_Size` is how much time in frames that the driver has to process incoming and outgoing audio. It can be used to delay the audio inside of BlackHole up to a maximum of 65536 frames. This may be helpful if using BlackHole with a high channel count. \n\n`kSampleRates` set the sample rate or sample rates of the audio device. If using multiple sample rates separate each with a comma (`,`). For example: `kSampleRates='44100,48000'`.\n\n### Mirror Device\n\nBy default BlackHole has a hidden mirrored audio device. The devices may be customized using the following constants. \n\n```\n// Original Device\nkDevice_IsHidden\nkDevice_HasInput\nkDevice_HasOutput\n\n// Mirrored Device\nkDevice2_IsHidden\nkDevice2_HasInput\nkDevice2_HasOutput\n```\n\nWhen all are set to true a 2nd BlackHole will show up that works exactly the same. The inputs and outputs are mirrored so the outputs from both devices go to the inputs of both devices.\n\nThis is useful if you need a separate device for input and output.\n\nExample\n\n```\n// Original Device\nkDevice_IsHidden=false\nkDevice_HasInput=true\nkDevice_HasOutput=false\n\n// Mirrored Device\nkDevice2_IsHidden=false\nkDevice2_HasInput=false\nkDevice2_HasOutput=true\n```\n\nIn this situation we have two BlackHole devices. One will have inputs only and the other will have outputs only.\n\nOne way to use this in projects is to hide the mirrored device and use it behind the scenes. That way the user will see an input only device while routing audio through to the output behind them scenes. \n\nHidden audio devices can be accessed using `kAudioHardwarePropertyTranslateUIDToDevice`.\n\n### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment\n\nBlackHole can be integrated into your CI/CD. Take a look at the [create_installer.sh](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/blob/master/Installer/create_installer.sh) shell script to see how the installer is built, signed and notarized.\n\n## Feature Requests\n\nIf you are interested in any of the following features please leave a comment in the linked issue. To request a features not listed please create a new issue.\n\n- [Sync Clock with other Audio Devices](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/issues/27) in development see v0.3.0\n- [Output Blackhole to other Audio Device](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/issues/40)\n- [Add Support for AU Plug-ins](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/issues/18)\n- [Inter-channel routing](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/issues/13)\n- [Record Directly to File](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/issues/8)\n- [Configuration Options Menu](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/issues/7)\n- [Support for Additional Bit Depths](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/issues/42)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why isn't BlackHole showing up in the Applications folder?\n\nBlackHole is a virtual audio loopback driver. It only shows up in `Audio MIDI Setup`, `Sound Preferences`, or other audio applications.\n\n### How can I listen to the audio and use BlackHole at the same time?\n\nSee [Setup a Multi-Output Device](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/wiki/Multi-Output-Device).\n\n### What bit depth does BlackHole use, and can I change it?\n\nBlackHole uses 32-bit float bit depth since macOS Core Audio natively uses 32-bit at the system level. This provides the broadest compatibility and greatest audio headroom.\n\nThis format is lossless for up to 24-bit integer. All applications should be able to playback and record audio, and do not require adjusting bit depth at the BlackHole driver level.\n\n### How can I change the volume of a Multi-Output device?\n\nUnfortunately macOS does not support changing the volume of a Multi-Output device but you can set the volume of individual devices in Audio MIDI Setup. \n\n### Why is nothing playing through BlackHole? \n\n- Check `System Preferences` \u2192 `Security & Privacy` \u2192 `Privacy` \u2192 `Microphone` to make sure your digital audio workstation (DAW) application has microphone access. \n\n- Check that the volume is all the way up on BlackHole input and output in ``Audio MIDI Setup``.\n\n- If you are using a multi-output device, due to issues with macOS the Built-in Output must be enabled and listed as the top device in the Multi-Output. [See here for details](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/wiki/Multi-Output-Device#4-select-output-devices).\n\n### Why is audio glitching after X minutes when using a multi-output or an aggregate?\n\n- You need to enable drift correction for all devices except the Clock Source also known as Master Device or Primary Device.\n\n### Why is the Installer failing?\n\n- Certain versions of macOS have a known issue where install packages may fail to install when the install package is located in certain folders. If you downloaded the .pkg file to your Downloads folder, try moving it to the Desktop and open the .pkg again (or vice-versa).\n\n### What Apps Don't Work with Multi-Outputs?\n\nUnfortunately multi-outputs can be buggy and some apps won't work with them at all. Here is a list of known ones. If additional incompatible applications are found, please report them by opening an [issue](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/issues).\n\n- Apple Podcasts\n- Apple Messages\n- HDHomeRun\n\n### AirPods with an Aggregate/Multi-Output is not working.\n\nThe microphone from AirPods runs at a lower sample rate which means it should not be used as the primary/clock device in an Aggregate or Multi-Output device. The solution is to use your built-in speakers (and just mute them) or BlackHole 2ch as the primary/clock device. BlackHole 16ch will not work as the primary since the primary needs to have 2ch. \n\nRead [this discussion](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/issues/146) for more details.\n\n### Can I integrate BlackHole into my app?\n\nBlackHole is licensed under GPL-3.0. You can use BlackHole as long as your app is also licensed as GPL-3.0. For all other applications please [contact Existential Audio directly](mailto:devinroth@existential.audio).\n\n## Links and Resources\n### [MultiSoundChanger](https://github.com/rlxone/MultiSoundChanger)\nA small tool for changing sound volume even for aggregate devices cause native sound volume controller can't change volume of aggregate devices\n### [BackgroundMusic](https://github.com/kyleneideck/BackgroundMusic)\nBackground Music, a macOS audio utility: automatically pause your music, set individual apps' volumes and record system audio.\n\n",
