The examples here demonstrate the most common uses of the SDK for each language.\n\n|     SDK    |       folder      | SDK version |\n|:----------:|:-----------------:|:-----------:|\n| .NET       | [dotnetv3/](dotnetv3)         | 3.5+        |\n| .NET       | [dotnet/](.dotnet)           | <3.5        |\n| C++        | [cpp/](cpp)              | 1           |\n| Go         | [gov2/](gov2)            | 2           |\n| Go         | [go/](go)               | 1           |\n| Java       | [javav2/](javav2)           | 2           |\n| Java       | [java/](java)             | 1           |\n| JavaScript | [javascriptv3/](javascriptv3)     | 3           |\n| JavaScript | [javascript/](javascriptv)       | 2           |\n| Kotlin     | [kotlin/](kotlin)           | 1             |\n| PHP        | [php/](php)              | 3           |\n| Python     | [python/](python)           | 3           |\n| Ruby       | [ruby/](ruby)             | 3           |\n| Rust       | [rustv1/](rustv1) | 1             |\n| Swift      | [swift/](swift)            | preview           |\n\nWithin each directory, you will find SDK-specific instructions for understanding and invoking example code.\n\n### NOTE\nIn alignment with our SDKs and Tools Maintenance Policy, the AWS SDK for Java v1.x will enter maintenance mode on July 31, 2024, and reach end-of-support on December 31, 2025.\n\nFor more information, see [Announcing end-of-support for AWS SDK for Java v1.x](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-java-v1-x-on-december-31-2025/).\n\n\n### Additional directories\n\n| directory                     | purpose                                                                                                                                                     | usage                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [/applications](applications) | Contains the non-language-specific components of example applications, which show how the SDKs can be used in the context of a production-like application. | To view the language-specific components for each example application, see the `cross-service` folder in the sub-directory for your desired language (such as `python/cross-service`). |\n| [/test](test)                 | Contains all components supporting the custom test automation framework used to routinely test the code in this repository.                                 | Deploys to AWS as a polyglot container-based integration testing solution.

For more information about creating an account, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).\n\nYou must also have AWS credentials configured. For steps on using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to configure credentials, see [CLI Configuration basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Usage disclaimer\n\nThese code examples interact with services that may incur charges to your AWS account. For more information, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/).\n\nAdditionally, example code might theoretically modify or delete existing AWS resources. As a matter of due diligence, do the following:\n\n- Be aware of the resources that these examples create or delete.\n- Be aware of the costs that might be charged to your account as a result.\n- Back up your important data.\n\n# Contributing\n\nThis repository thrives on your contributions! \u2764\ufe0f To get involved, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). \ud83d\ude4f\n\n# Requests\n\nRequests for examples can be made via [Issue tracker](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=type%2Fenhancement&projects=&template=enhancement.yaml&title=%5BEnhancement%5D%3A+%3CDESCRIPTIVE+TITLE+HERE%3E).\n\n## How we prioritize contributions and requests\nOur team reviews all requests, evaluating them for the following:\n- Clarity\n- Relevance\n- Feasibility\n\n**All examples requests should be made as early as possible. For larger examples, this should be at least two months in advance of the required date.**\n\nBased on the evaluation, we determine the priority of each request and allocate resources accordingly. We prioritize requests that are clear, relevant, and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. An accompanying high quality PR increases the chance we can address the request.\n\nPlease note that some requests, such as bug fixes and security issues, take priority over new code examples. Additionally, we have finite resources and our own priorities that guide the development of code examples. If you have any questions or would like to contribute, please refer to our [contribution guide](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## Tributaries\n\nThe AWS Documentation includes source code examples from several additional sources. These sources are called tributaries, flowing into the \"river\" of AWS Documentation.\n\n* [awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples)\n* [aws-samples/serverless-snippets](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-snippets)\n* [aws/aws-tools-for-powershell](https://github.com/aws/aws-tools-for-powershell)\n\n# Copyright and license\n\nAll content in this repository, unless otherwise stated, is\nCopyright \u00a9 Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.
