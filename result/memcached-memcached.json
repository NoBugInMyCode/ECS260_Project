Please use the mailing\nlist to ask questions, github issues aren't seen by everyone!\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* libevent - https://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/ (libevent-dev)\n* libseccomp (optional, experimental, linux) - enables process restrictions for\n  better security. Tested only on x86-64 architectures.\n* openssl (optional) - enables TLS support. need relatively up to date\n  version. pkg-config is needed to find openssl dependencies (such as -lz).\n\n## Environment\n\nBe warned that the -k (mlockall) option to memcached might be\ndangerous when using a large cache. Just make sure the memcached machines\ndon't swap.  memcached does non-blocking network I/O, but not disk.  (it\nshould never go to disk, or you've lost the whole point of it)\n\n## Build status\n\nSee https://build.memcached.org/ for multi-platform regression testing status.\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFeel free to use the issue tracker on github.\n\n**If you are reporting a security bug** please contact a maintainer privately.\nWe follow responsible disclosure: we handle reports privately, prepare a\npatch, allow notifications to vendor lists. Then we push a fix release and your\nbug can be posted publicly with credit in our release notes and commit\nhistory.\n\n## Website\n\n* https://www.memcached.org\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/DevelopmentRepos\n",
