The best opportunities to getting jank-free transitions on phones/tablets are CSS transition and keyframe animation based, especially tapping into hardware-accelerated transforms and opacity changes.\n\n@daneden did really nice work with [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/) but I think the web would benefit if we could take that work to the next level. There's already been fantastic experiments and demos exploring CSS-based transitions, but it's distributed all over.\n\nOriginally started at [h5bp/lazyweb-requests#122](https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/122)\n\n#### Effeckt Trailer\n\n<a href=\"http://youtu.be/Qc40YDFA4Bg\">![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/39191/725426/aa3af38c-e067-11e2-82e4-269086cb845d.png)</a>\n\n## Examples To Add\n\n* [tympanus.net/Development/ModalWindowEffects/](http://tympanus.net/Development/ModalWindowEffects/)\n* [tympanus.net/Development/PageTransitions/](http://tympanus.net/Development/PageTransitions/)\n* [tympanus.net/Development/PFold/index2.html](http://tympanus.net/Development/PFold/index2.html)\n* [leaverou.github.io/animatable/](http://leaverou.github.io/animatable/)\n* [lab.hakim.se/ladda/](http://lab.hakim.se/ladda/)\n* [lab.hakim.se/kontext/](http://lab.hakim.se/kontext/)\n* [lab.hakim.se/avgrund/](http://lab.hakim.se/avgrund/)\n* [lab.hakim.se/meny/](http://lab.hakim.se/meny/)\n\nBecause there are so many, I expect we could **group things by role**:\n\n* button/touch effects\n* state transition\n* modal/notification transition\n* attention attractors\n\n## Goals\n\n1. Provide a minimal UI. Only use style hooks for transitions and animations.\n1. Designer-curated set of classy and reasonable effects. (no [`easeInBounce`](http://easings.net/#easeInBounce))\n1. Establish browser support guidelines (e.g. Android 2.3 would gracefully degrade)\n1. CSS performance regression testing (a la [bench.topcoat.io](http://bench.topcoat.io))\n1. Deliver jank-free *60fps* performance on target browsers/devices\n1. If a particular effect cannot deliver target performance (hey `blur()` css filter), it cannot be included.\n1. Guidelines on what to avoid when styling these affected elements (avoid expensive CSS)\n1. Deliver a builder so users can pull only the CSS they need.\n1. There is no hover on the mobile web, so any hover-based effects would be excluded or have a tap-based equivalent.\n\n## Action\n\n* If you know other transition/animation based demos/experiments that make sense to include here, file a ticket.\n* If you're interested in helping to define the API, let's hear it! File a ticket.\n* A web-based builder is a must. A command-line builder isn't important for this.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- [https://github.com/h5bp/Effeckt.css/wiki/Getting-Started](https://github.com/h5bp/Effeckt.css/wiki/Getting-Started)\n\n## Code Style Guide\n\n- [https://github.com/h5bp/Effeckt.css/wiki/Code-Style-Guide](https://github.com/h5bp/Effeckt.css/wiki/Code-Style-Guide)\n\n## General Inquiries & Support\n\n- Effeckt.css Mailing List [https://groups.google.com/d/forum/effeckt](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/effeckt)\n\n## Bug Reports & Feature Requests\n\n- [http://github.com/h5bp/Effeckt.css/issues](https://github.com/h5bp/Effeckt.css/issues)\n",
