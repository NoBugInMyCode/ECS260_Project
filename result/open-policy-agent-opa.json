For details read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2021/02/04/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-open-policy-agent-graduation/).\n\n## Get started with OPA\n\n- Write your first Rego policy with the [Rego Playground](https://play.openpolicyagent.org) or use it to share your work with others for feedback and support. Have a look at the [Access Control examples](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/?example-group=access-control) if you're not sure where to start.\n- Install the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tsandall.opa) to get started locally with live diagnostics, debugging and formatting. See [Editor and IDE Support](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/edge/editor-and-ide-support/) for other supported editors.\n- Go to the [OPA Documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) to\n  learn about the Rego language as well as how to deploy and integrate OPA.\n- Check out the learning resources in the [Learning Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/ecosystem/learning-rego/) section of the ecosystem directory.\n- Follow the [Running OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#running-opa) instructions to get started with the OPA CLI locally.\n- See [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openpolicyagent/opa/tags/) for container images and the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases) for binaries.\n- Check out the [OPA Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16QV6gvLDOV3I0_guPC3_19g6jHkEg3X9xqMYgtoCKrs/edit?usp=sharing) to see a high-level snapshot of OPA features in-progress and planned.\n\n## Want to talk about OPA or get support?\n\n- Join the [OPA Slack](https://slack.openpolicyagent.org) to talk to other OPA users and maintainers. See `#help` for support.\n- Check out the [Community Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/open-policy-agent/discussions) to ask questions.\n\n## Interested to learn what others are doing with OPA?\n\n- Browse community projects on the [OPA Ecosystem Directory](http://openpolicyagent.org/ecosystem/) - don't forget to [list your own](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/tree/main/docs#opa-ecosystem)!\n- Check out the [ADOPTERS.md](./ADOPTERS.md) file for a list of production adopters. Does your organization use OPA in production? Support the OPA project by submitting a PR to add your organization to the list with a short description of your OPA use cases!\n\n## Want to integrate OPA?\n\n- See the high-level [Go SDK](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/integration/#integrating-with-the-go-sdk) or the low-level Go API\n  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego)\n  to integrate OPA with services written in Go.\n- See the [REST API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/rest-api.html)\n  reference to integrate OPA with services written in other languages.\n- See the [integration docs](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/integration/) for more options.\n\n## Want to contribute to OPA?\n\n- Read the [Contributing Guide](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/contributing/) to learn how to make your first contribution.\n- Use [#contributors](https://openpolicyagent.slack.com/archives/C02L1TLPN59) in Slack to talk to other contributors and OPA maintainers.\n- File a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues) to request features or report bugs.\n\n## How does OPA work?\n\nOPA gives you a high-level declarative language to author and enforce policies\nacross your stack.\n\nWith OPA, you define _rules_ that govern how your system should behave. These\nrules exist to answer questions like:\n\n- Can user X call operation Y on resource Z?\n- What clusters should workload W be deployed to?\n- What tags must be set on resource R before it's created?\n\nYou integrate services with OPA so that these kinds of policy decisions do not\nhave to be _hardcoded_ in your service. Services integrate with OPA by\nexecuting _queries_ when policy decisions are needed.\n\nWhen you query OPA for a policy decision, OPA evaluates the rules and data\n(which you give it) to produce an answer. The policy decision is sent back as\nthe result of the query.\n\nFor example, in a simple API authorization use case:\n\n- You write rules that allow (or deny) access to your service APIs.\n- Your service queries OPA when it receives API requests.\n- OPA returns allow (or deny) decisions to your service.\n- Your service _enforces_ the decisions by accepting or rejecting requests accordingly.\n\nFor concrete examples of how to integrate OPA with systems like [Kubernetes](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/kubernetes-admission-control.html), [Terraform](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/terraform.html), [Docker](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/docker-authorization.html), [SSH](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/ssh-and-sudo-authorization.html), and more, see [openpolicyagent.org](https://www.openpolicyagent.org).\n\n## Presentations\n\n- Open Policy Agent (OPA) Intro & Deep Dive @ Kubecon NA 2023: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJkjsvVpj_Q)\n- Open Policy Agent (OPA) Intro & Deep Dive @ Kubecon EU 2023: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RNp3m_THw4)\n- Running Policy in Hard to Reach Places with WASM & OPA @ CN Wasm Day EU 2023: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdeBhukLwt4)\n- OPA maintainers talk @ Kubecon NA 2022: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMiovzGGCfI)\n- Open Policy Agent (OPA) Intro & Deep Dive @ Kubecon EU 2022: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhyQxIp1H58)\n- Open Policy Agent Intro @ KubeCon EU 2021: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CgeiWkliaw)\n- Using Open Policy Agent to Meet Evolving Policy Requirements @ KubeCon NA 2020: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVuM7F_BTyc)\n- Applying Policy Throughout The Application Lifecycle with Open Policy Agent @ CloudNativeCon 2019: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXfsaE6RKfc)\n- Open Policy Agent Introduction @ CloudNativeCon EU 2018: [video](https://youtu.be/XEHeexPpgrA), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/opa-the-cloud-native-policy-engine)\n- Rego Deep Dive @ CloudNativeCon EU 2018: [video](https://youtu.be/4mBJSIhs2xQ), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/rego-deep-dive)\n- How Netflix Is Solving Authorization Across Their Cloud @ CloudNativeCon US 2017: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6tUNpRpdnY), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/how-netflix-is-solving-authorization-across-their-cloud).\n- Policy-based Resource Placement in Kubernetes Federation @ LinuxCon Beijing 2017: [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/policybased-resource-placement-across-hybrid-cloud), [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRz13baBhfg&feature=youtu.be)\n- Enforcing Bespoke Policies In Kubernetes @ KubeCon US 2017: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llDI8VvkUj8), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/enforcing-bespoke-policies-in-kubernetes)\n- Istio's Mixer: Policy Enforcement with Custom Adapters @ CloudNativeCon US 2017: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czZLXUqzd24), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/istios-mixer-policy-enforcement-with-custom-adapters-cloud-nativecon-17)\n\n## Security\n\nA third party security audit was performed by Cure53, you can see the full report [here](SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf).\n\nPlease report vulnerabilities by email to [open-policy-agent-security](mailto:open-policy-agent-security@googlegroups.com).\nWe will send a confirmation message to acknowledge that we have received the\nreport and then we will send additional messages to follow up once the issue\nhas been investigated.\n",
