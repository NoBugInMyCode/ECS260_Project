Get source code by executing the following command in Terminal.app.\n\n    ```shell\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements.git\n    cd Karabiner-Elements\n    git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1\n    ```\n\n2.  (Optional) If you have a codesign identity:\n\n    1.  Find your codesign identity.\n\n        ```shell\n        security find-identity -p codesigning -v | grep 'Developer ID Application'\n        ```\n\n        The result is as follows.\n\n        ```text\n        1) 8D660191481C98F5C56630847A6C39D95C166F22 \"Developer ID Application: Fumihiko Takayama (G43BCU2T37)\"\n        ```\n\n        Your codesign identity is `8D660191481C98F5C56630847A6C39D95C166F22` in the above case.\n\n    2.  Set environment variable to use your codesign identity.\n\n        ```shell\n        export PQRS_ORG_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=8D660191481C98F5C56630847A6C39D95C166F22\n        ```\n\n    3.  Find your codesign identity for installer signing.\n\n        ```shell\n        security find-identity -p basic -v | grep 'Developer ID Installer'\n        ```\n\n        The result is as follows.\n\n        ```text\n        1) C86BB5F7830071C7B0B07D168A9A9375CC2D02C5 \"Developer ID Installer: Fumihiko Takayama (G43BCU2T37)\"\n        ```\n\n        Your codesign identity is `C86BB5F7830071C7B0B07D168A9A9375CC2D02C5` in the above case.\n\n    4.  Set environment variable to use your codesign identity for installer signing.\n\n        ```shell\n        export PQRS_ORG_INSTALLER_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=C86BB5F7830071C7B0B07D168A9A9375CC2D02C5\n        ```\n\n3.  Build a package by executing the following command in Terminal.app.\n\n    ```shell\n    make package\n    ```\n\n    The `make` script will create a redistributable **Karabiner-Elements-VERSION.dmg** in the current directory.\n\n#### Note about pre-built binaries in the source tree\n\nKarabiner-Elements uses some pre-built binaries in the source tree.\n\n-   `src/vendor/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/dist/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice-*.pkg` (the latest one)\n-   `Sparkle.framework` in `src/apps/SettingsWindow/`\n\nThe above `make package` command does not rebuild these binaries.<br/>\n(These binaries will be copied in the distributed package.)\n\nIf you want to rebuild these binaries, you have to build them manually.<br/>\nPlease follow the instruction of these projects.\n",
