One way to go through\nthem is to [search GitHub for \"dotfiles\"](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&type=Repositories).\n\nAlso see:\n\n- [Google for \"dotfiles\"](https://www.google.nl/search?q=dotfiles)\n- [Archlinux collection](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles)\n- Tip: search for a filename on GitHub, e.g.\n  [path:\\*\\*/.gitconfig](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=path%3A**%2F.gitconfig).\n\n## Example dotfiles repos\n\nA collection of the most popular, well-maintained, and collaborative dotfiles repositories & frameworks. Some projects\ncontain just the dotfiles. Others go further by allowing you to easily add your own custom dotfiles, and some include\nscripts to manage dotfiles and plugins.\n\n### Bash\n\n| Title                                                               | Description                                  | Focus                                                                                                                        |\n| :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Bash it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it)                       | Community bash framework.                    | Autocompletion, themes, aliases, custom functions.
