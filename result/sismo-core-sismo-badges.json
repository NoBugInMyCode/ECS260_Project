It is owned by the governance that authorizes/unauthorize issuers to record in it\n - `core/Attester.sol` The standard abstract contract must be inherited by attesters. Attesters are issuers of attestations. They verify user requests and build attestations that will be recorded in the registry\n - `core/Badges.sol` Reads the registry. Stateless Non Transferable Token view of attestations (ERC1155)\n\nIt also contains implementations of attester in `attesters/`:\n- `HydraS1SimpleAttester.sol`: ZK Attester using the [Hydra S1 Proving Scheme](https://hydra-s1.docs.sismo.io) and the notion of nullifiers. Users must provide a ZK Proof along with their request to generate attestations\n- `HydraS1AccountboundAttester.sol`: Accountbound version of the Simple Hydra S1 Simple Attester. (Users can update at will where the attestation is stored)\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## Sismo protocol\n\nA complete overview of the protocol is available in our [documentation](https://protocol.docs.sismo.io)\n\n\n## Deployed contracts\n\nDeployed contracts can be found [here](https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/deployed-contract-addresses)\n\n\n## Usage\n### Installation\n```\nyarn\n```\n\n### Compile contracts\nCompile contracts using hardhat\n```\nyarn compile\n```\n\n### Test\nLaunch all tests\n\n```\nyarn test\n```\n\n### Print storage layout \n```\nyarn storage-layout\n```\n\n### Deploy on local chain\n\nTerminal tab 1\n```\nyarn chain\n```\n\nTerminal tab 2\n```\nyarn deploy:local\n```\n\n\n## Create a new Attester\n\nTo develop a new attester, you must inherit the `core/Attester.sol` abstract contract and implement the following functions: \n\n-  `_verifyRequest(request, proofData)`: You must implement the user request verification against the proof provided by the user\n-  `buildAttestations(request, proofData)`: You must build the attestations that will be recorded from a verified user request\n\nOther optional hook functions that can be implemented:\n\n- `_beforeRecordAttestations(request, proofData)`\n- `_afterRecordAttestations(request, proofData)`\n\nThe `/attesters/hydra-s1/HydraS1SimpleAttester.sol` is a good example of an attester implementing those functions.\n\nA [guide](https://attesters.docs.sismo.io) is offered in our documentation.\n\nFeel free open a PR with your new attester in `/attester`!\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the MIT License.\n\n## Contribute\n\nPlease, feel free to open issues, PRs or simply provide feedback!\n\n## Contact\n\nPrefer [Discord](https://discord.gg/sismo) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sismo_eth)\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://static.sismo.io/readme/bottom-main.png\" alt=\"bottom\" width=\"100%\" >\n\n",
