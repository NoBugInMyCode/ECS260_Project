[Install Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/doc/install) (_if you haven't already_)\n\n1. Create a new project directory with the following `main.go` file inside it:\n    ```go\n    package main\n\n    import (\n        \"log\"\n\n        \"github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase\"\n        \"github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core\"\n    )\n\n    func main() {\n        app := pocketbase.New()\n\n        app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {\n            // registers new \"GET /hello\" route\n            se.Router.GET(\"/hello\", func(re *core.RequestEvent) error {\n                return re.String(200, \"Hello world!\")\n            })\n\n            return se.Next()\n        })\n\n        if err := app.Start(); err != nil {\n            log.Fatal(err)\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. To init the dependencies, run `go mod init myapp && go mod tidy`.\n\n3. To start the application, run `go run main.go serve`.\n\n4. To build a statically linked executable, you can run `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build` and then start the created executable with `./myapp serve`.\n\n_For more details please refer to [Extend with Go](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/)._\n\n### Building and running the repo main.go example\n\nTo build the minimal standalone executable, like the prebuilt ones in the releases page, you can simply run `go build` inside the `examples/base` directory:\n\n0. [Install Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/doc/install) (_if you haven't already_)\n1. Clone/download the repo\n2. Navigate to `examples/base`\n3. Run `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build`\n   (_https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment_)\n4. Start the created executable by running `./base serve`.\n\nNote that the supported build targets by the pure Go SQLite driver at the moment are:\n\n```\ndarwin  amd64\ndarwin  arm64\nfreebsd amd64\nfreebsd arm64\nlinux   386\nlinux   amd64\nlinux   arm\nlinux   arm64\nlinux   ppc64le\nlinux   riscv64\nlinux   s390x\nwindows amd64\nwindows arm64\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nPocketBase comes with mixed bag of unit and integration tests.\nTo run them, use the standard `go test` command:\n\n```sh\ngo test ./...\n```\n\nCheck also the [Testing guide](http://pocketbase.io/docs/testing) to learn how to write your own custom application tests.\n\n## Security\n\nIf you discover a security vulnerability within PocketBase, please send an e-mail to **support at pocketbase.io**.\n\nAll reports will be promptly addressed and you'll be credited in the fix release notes.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPocketBase is free and open source project licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).\nYou are free to do whatever you want with it, even offering it as a paid service.\n\nYou could help continuing its development by:\n\n- [Contribute to the source code](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Suggest new features and report issues](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/issues)\n\nPRs for new OAuth2 providers, bug fixes, code optimizations and documentation improvements are more than welcome.\n\nBut please refrain creating PRs for _new features_ without previously discussing the implementation details.\nPocketBase has a [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/pocketbase/projects/2) and I try to work on issues in specific order and such PRs often come in out of nowhere and skew all initial planning with tedious back-and-forth communication.\n\nDon't get upset if I close your PR, even if it is well executed and tested. This doesn't mean that it will never be merged.\nLater we can always refer to it and/or take pieces of your implementation when the time comes to work on the issue (don't worry you'll be credited in the release notes).\n",
