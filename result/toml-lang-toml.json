TOML is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table. TOML\nshould be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages.\n\n## Example\n\n```toml\n# This is a TOML document.\n\ntitle = \"TOML Example\"\n\n[owner]\nname = \"Tom Preston-Werner\"\ndob = 1979-05-27T07:32:00-08:00 # First class dates\n\n[database]\nserver = \"192.168.1.1\"\nports = [ 8000, 8001, 8002 ]\nconnection_max = 5000\nenabled = true\n\n[servers]\n\n  # Indentation (tabs and/or spaces) is allowed but not required\n  [servers.alpha]\n  ip = \"10.0.0.1\"\n  dc = \"eqdc10\"\n\n  [servers.beta]\n  ip = \"10.0.0.2\"\n  dc = \"eqdc10\"\n\n[clients]\ndata = [ [\"gamma\", \"delta\"], [1, 2] ]\n\n# Line breaks are OK when inside arrays\nhosts = [\n  \"alpha\",\n  \"omega\"\n]\n```\n\n## Comparison with Other Formats\n\nTOML shares traits with other file formats used for application configuration\nand data serialization, such as YAML and JSON. TOML and JSON both are simple and\nuse ubiquitous data types, making them easy to code for or parse with machines.\nTOML and YAML both emphasize human readability features, like comments that make\nit easier to understand the purpose of a given line. TOML differs in combining\nthese, allowing comments (unlike JSON) but preserving simplicity (unlike YAML).\n\nBecause TOML is explicitly intended as a configuration file format, parsing it\nis easy, but it is not intended for serializing arbitrary data structures. TOML\nalways has a hash table at the top level of the file, which can easily have data\nnested inside its keys, but it doesn't permit top-level arrays or floats, so it\ncannot directly serialize some data. There is also no standard identifying the\nstart or end of a TOML file, which can complicate sending it through a stream.\nThese details must be negotiated on the application layer.\n\nINI files are frequently compared to TOML for their similarities in syntax and\nuse as configuration files. However, there is no standardized format for INI and\nthey do not gracefully handle more than one or two levels of nesting.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n- YAML spec: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html\n- JSON spec: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259\n- Wikipedia on INI files: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\n\n## Get Involved\n\nDocumentation, bug reports, pull requests, and all other contributions are\nwelcome!\n\n## Wiki\n\nWe have an [Official TOML Wiki](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/wiki) that\ncatalogs the following:\n\n- Projects using TOML\n- Implementations\n- Validators\n- Language-agnostic test suite for TOML decoders and encoders\n- Editor support\n- Encoders\n- Converters\n\nPlease take a look if you'd like to view or add to that list. Thanks for being a\npart of the TOML community!\n",
