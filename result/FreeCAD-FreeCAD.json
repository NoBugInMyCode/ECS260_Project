The following pages contain updated build instructions for\ntheir respective platforms:\n\n- [Linux](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_Linux)\n- [Windows](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_Windows)\n- [macOS](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_MacOS)\n- [MinGW](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_MinGW)\n\n\nReporting Issues\n---------\n\nTo report an issue please:\n\n- Consider posting to the [Forum](https://forum.freecad.org), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/F4hdxzYZfc) channel, or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD) to verify the issue; \n- Search the existing [issues](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues) for potential duplicates; \n- Use the most updated stable or [development versions](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Bundle/releases/tag/weekly-builds) of FreeCAD; \n- Post version info from `Help > About FreeCAD > Copy to clipboard`; \n- Restart FreeCAD in safe mode `Help > Restart in safe mode` and try to reproduce the issue again. If the issue is resolved it can be fixed by deleting the FreeCAD config files.\n- Start recording a macro `Macro > Macro recording...` and repeat all steps. Stop recording after the issue occurs and upload the saved macro or copy the macro code in the issue; \n- Post a Step-By-Step explanation on how to recreate the issue; \n- Upload an example file (FCStd as ZIP file) to demonstrate the problem; \n\nFor more details see:\n\n- [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues)\n- [Reporting Issues and Requesting Features](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/new/choose)\n- [Contributing](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Help Forum](https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=3)\n- [Developers Handbook](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/)\n\n> [!NOTE]\nThe [FPA](https://fpa.freecad.org) offers developers the opportunity\nto apply for a grant to work on projects of their choosing.
