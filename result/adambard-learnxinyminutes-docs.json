Just grab an existing file from this\nrepo and copy the formatting (don't worry, it's all very simple). Make a new\nfile, send a pull request, and if it passes muster I'll get it up pronto.\nRemember to fill in the \"contributors\" fields so you get credited properly!\n\n## Contributing\n\nAll contributions are welcome, from the tiniest typo to a brand new article.\nTranslations in all languages are welcome (or, for that matter, original\narticles in any language). Send a pull request or open an issue any time of day\nor night.\n\n**Please prepend the tag `[language/lang-code]` to your issues and pull\nrequests.** For example, `[python/en]` for English Python. This will help\neveryone pick out things they care about.\n\nWe're happy for any contribution in any form, but if you're making more than one\nmajor change (i.e. translations for two different languages) it would be super\ncool of you to make a separate pull request for each one so that someone can\nreview them more effectively and/or individually.\n\nFor a detailed style guide, please review the full [CONTRIBUTING][2] guidelines.\n\n## License\n\nContributors retain copyright to their work, and can request removal at any\ntime. By uploading a doc here, you agree to publish your work under the default\n[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported][3] licensing included on\neach doc page.\n\nAnything not covered by the above -- basically, this README -- you can use as\nyou wish, I guess.\n\n\n[1]: https://learnxinyminutes.com\n[2]: /CONTRIBUTING.md\n[3]: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US\n",
