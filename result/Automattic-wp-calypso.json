[We have them](./docs/install.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf Calypso sparks your interest, don\u2019t hesitate to send a pull request, send a suggestion, file a bug, or just ask a question. We promise we\u2019ll be nice.

We're committed to doing our part to make both Calypso and the wider WordPress community welcoming to everyone.\n\nYou can contribute in many ways.
