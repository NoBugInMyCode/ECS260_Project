There are a few things we probably won't do in production if we were optimizing for performance, for example:\n\n- This demo uses the Firebase-based HN API to showcase real-time updates, but the Firebase API also comes with a larger bundle, more JavaScript to parse on the client, and doesn't offer an efficient way to batch-fetch pages of items, so it impacts performance quite a bit on a cold start or cache miss.\n\n- In practice, it is unnecessary to code-split for an app of this size (where each async chunk is only a few kilobytes so the extra request isn't really worth it), nor is it optimal to extract an extra CSS file (which is only 1kb).\n\nIt is therefore not recommended to use this app as a reference for Vue SSR performance - instead, do your own benchmarking, and make sure to measure and optimize based on your actual app constraints.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n<img width=\"973\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-08-11 at 6 06 57 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/499550/17607895/786a415a-5fee-11e6-9c11-45a2cfdf085c.png\">\n\n**A detailed Vue SSR guide can be found [here](https://ssr.vuejs.org).**\n\n## Build Setup\n\n**Requires Node.js 7+**\n\n``` bash\n# install dependencies\nnpm install # or yarn\n\n# serve in dev mode, with hot reload at localhost:8080\nnpm run dev\n\n# build for production\nnpm run build\n\n# serve in production mode\nnpm start\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
