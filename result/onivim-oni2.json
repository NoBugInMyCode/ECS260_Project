Onivim 2 aims to bring the _speed_ of Sublime, the _language integration_ of VSCode, and the _modal editing experience_ of Vim together, in a single package.\n\nOnivim 2 is built in [`reason`](https://reasonml.github.io) using the [`revery`](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery) framework.\n\nOnivim 2 uses [`libvim`](https://github.com/onivim/libvim) to manage buffers and provide authentic modal editing, and features a fast, native front-end. In addition, Onivim 2 leverages the VSCode Extension Host process in its entirety - meaning, eventually, complete support for VSCode extensions and configuration.\n\n### Goals\n\n- __Modern UX__ - an experience on par with modern code editors like VSCode and Atom\n- __VSCode Plugin Support__ - use all of the features of VSCode plugins, including language servers and debuggers\n- __Cross-Platform__ - works on Windows, OSX, and Linux\n- __Batteries Included__ - works out of the box\n- __Performance__ - no compromises: native performance, minimal input latency\n- __Easy to Learn__ - Onivim 2 should be comfortable for non-vimmers, too!\n\nThe goal of this project is to build an editor that doesn't exist today - the _speed_ of a native code editor like Sublime, the _power_ of modal editing, and the _rich tooling_ that comes with a lightweight editor like VSCode.\n\n### Non-goals\n\n- __100% VimL compatibility__ - we may not support all features of VimL plugins / configuration.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- Onivim User Manual\n  - [Getting Started](https://onivim.github.io/docs/getting-started/why-onivim)\n  - [Basic Usage](https://onivim.github.io/docs/using-onivim/moving-in-onivim)\n  - [FAQ](https://onivim.github.io/docs/other/faq)\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe'd :heart: help building Onivim 2!\n\nIf you are interested in fixing issues and contributing directly to the code, please see the [How to Contribute](https://onivim.github.io/docs/for-developers/contributing) document, which includes the following:\n\n- [How to build and run from source](https://onivim.github.io/docs/for-developers/building)\n- [Pull Request Guidelines](https://onivim.github.io/docs/for-developers/contributing)\n\nPlease also see our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Feedback\n\n- [Tweet us](https://twitter.com/oni_vim) with feedback\n- Come visit us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7maEAxV)\n- Join the discussion on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/onivim)\n- [File an issue](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/issues) on GitHub\n\n## License\n\nOnivim 2 source code is licensed under the [MIT](LICENSE.md) license.\n\nOnivim 2 downloads, available at https://v2.onivim.io/, are licensed under the [Outrun Labs EULA 1.1](./Outrun-Labs-EULA-v1.1.md).\n\n#### Third-Party Code\n\nSeveral dependencies have their own set of license terms here: [ThirdPartyLicenses.txt](ThirdPartyLicenses.txt)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019-2020 Outrun Labs, LLC.\n",
