I've been building native mobile applications (Android/iOS/Blackberry) since 2011. I have a Software Engineering degree, not a Computer Science degree. I have an itty-bitty amount of basic knowledge about: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Probability & Statistics from university.\nThink about my interest in machine learning:\n- [Can I learn and get a job in Machine Learning without studying CS Master and PhD?](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-and-get-a-job-in-Machine-Learning-without-studying-CS-Master-and-PhD)\n    - *\"You can, but it is far more difficult than when I got into the field.\"* [Drac Smith](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-and-get-a-job-in-Machine-Learning-without-studying-CS-Master-and-PhD/answer/Drac-Smith?srid=oT0p)\n- [How do I get a job in Machine Learning as a software programmer who self-studies Machine Learning, but  never has a chance to use it at work?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-a-job-in-Machine-Learning-as-a-software-programmer-who-self-studies-Machine-Learning-but-never-has-a-chance-to-use-it-at-work)\n    - *\"I'm hiring machine learning experts for my team and your MOOC will not get you the job (there is better news below). In fact, many people with a master's in machine learning will not get the job because they (and most who have taken MOOCs) do not have a deep understanding that will help me solve my problems.\"* [Ross C.

It\u2019s the mess of reality.\n- Theoretical Machine Learning: This is about math and abstraction and idealized scenarios and limits and beauty and informing what is possible. It is a whole lot neater and cleaner and removed from the mess of reality.\n\nI think the best way for practice-focused methodology is something like ['practice \u2014 learning \u2014 practice'](http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-for-programmers/#comment-358985), that means where students first come with some existing projects with problems and solutions (practice) to get familiar with traditional methods in the area and perhaps also with their methodology. After practicing with some elementary experiences, they can go into the books and study the underlying theory, which serves to guide their future advanced practice and will enhance their toolbox of solving practical problems. Studying theory also further improves their understanding on the elementary experiences, and will help them acquire advanced experiences more quickly.\n\n It's a long plan. It's going to take me years. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.\n\n## How to use it\nEverything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.\n\nI'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.\n\n- [x] Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]\n\n[More about Github-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown)\n\n## Follow me\nI'm a Vietnamese Software Engineer who is really passionate and wants to work in the USA.\n\nHow much did I work during this plan?
