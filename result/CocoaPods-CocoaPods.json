The latest released Xcode versions and the \nprior version are supported.\n\nInstalling and updating CocoaPods is very easy. Don't miss the [Installation\nguide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation) and the\n[Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).\n\n## Project Goals\n\nCocoaPods aims to improve the engagement with, and discoverability \nof, third party open-source Cocoa libraries. These\nproject goals influence and drive the design of CocoaPods:\n\n- Create and share libraries, and use them in your own projects,\n  without creating extra work for library authors. Integrate\n  non-CocoaPods libraries and hack on your own fork of any\n  CocoaPods library with a simple transparent `Podspec` standard.\n- Allow library authors to structure their libraries however they like.\n- Save time for library authors by automating a lot of Xcode work not \n  related to their libraries' functionality.\n- Support any source management system. (Currently supported are `git`, \n  `svn`, `mercurial`, `bazaar`, and various types of archives downloaded over HTTP.)\n- Promote a culture of distributed collaboration on pods, but also provide\n  features only possible with a centralised solution to foster a community.\n- Build tools on top of the core Cocoa development system, including those \n  typically deployed to other operating systems, such as web-services.\n- Provide opinionated and automated integration, but make it completely\n  optional. You may manually integrate your CocoaPods dependencies\n  into your Xcode project as you see fit, with or without a workspace.\n- Solve everyday problems for Cocoa and Xcode developers.\n\n## Sponsors\n\nLovingly sponsored by a collection of companies, see the footer of [CocoaPods.org](https://cocoapods.org) for an up-to-date list. \n\n## Collaborate\n\nAll CocoaPods development happens on GitHub. Contributions make for good karma and\nwe [welcome new](https://blog.cocoapods.org/starting-open-source/) contributors with joy.
