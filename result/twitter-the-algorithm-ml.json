TwHIN embeddings (projects/twhin) https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05387\n\n\nThis project can be run inside a python virtualenv. We have only tried this on Linux machines and because we use torchrec it works best with an Nvidia GPU. To setup run\n\n`./images/init_venv.sh` (Linux only).\n\nThe READMEs of each project contain instructions about how to run each project.\n",
