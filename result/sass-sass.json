Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules,\nvariables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. It's translated to\nwell-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a plugin for your\nbuild system.\n\n```scss\n$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;\n$primary-color: #333;\n\nbody {\n  font: 100% $font-stack;\n  color: $primary-color;\n}\n\n@mixin border-radius($radius) {\n  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;\n     -moz-border-radius: $radius;\n      -ms-border-radius: $radius;\n          border-radius: $radius;\n}\n\nnav {\n  ul {\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    list-style: none;\n  }\n\n  li { @include border-radius(10px); }\n\n  a {\n    display: block;\n    padding: 6px 12px;\n    text-decoration: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Install Sass\n\nYou can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the package for\nyour operating system [from GitHub] and [adding it to your `PATH`][PATH]. That's\nall\u2014there are no external dependencies and nothing else you need to install.\n\n[from GitHub]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases\n[PATH]: https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/\n\nIf you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using [npm] by running\n\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/\n\n```\nnpm install -g sass\n```\n\n**However, please note** that this will install the pure JavaScript\nimplementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower than the other options listed\nhere. But it has the same interface, so it'll be easy to swap in another\nimplementation later if you need a bit more speed!\n\nSee [the Sass website](https://sass-lang.com/install) for more ways to install\nSass.\n\nOnce you have Sass installed, you can run the `sass` executable to compile\n`.sass` and `.scss` files to `.css` files. For example:\n\n```\nsass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css\n```\n\n## Learn Sass\n\nCheck out [the Sass website](https://sass-lang.com/guide) for a guide on how to\nlearn Sass!\n\n## This Repository\n\nThis repository isn't an implementation of Sass. Those live in\n[`sass/dart-sass`] and [`sass/libsass`]. Instead, it contains:\n\n[`sass/dart-sass`]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass\n[`sass/libsass`]: https://github.com/sass/libsass\n\n* [`spec/`], which contains specifications for language features.\n* [`proposal/`], which contains in-progress proposals for changes to the\n  language.\n* [`accepted/`], which contains proposals that have been accepted and are either\n  implemented or in the process of being implemented.\n\n[`spec/`]: https://github.com/sass/sass/tree/main/spec\n[`proposal/`]: https://github.com/sass/sass/tree/main/proposal\n[`accepted/`]: https://github.com/sass/sass/tree/main/accepted\n\nNote that this doesn't contain a full specification of Sass. Instead, feature\nspecifications are written as needed when a new feature is being designed or\nwhen an implementor needs additional clarity about how something is supposed to\nwork. This means many of the specs in `spec/` only cover small portions of the\nfeatures in question.\n\n### Versioning Policy\n\nThe proposals in this repository are versioned, to make it easy to track changes\nover time and to refer to older versions. Every version has a Git tag of the\nform `proposal.<name>.draft-<version>`. A new version should be created for each\nbatch of changes.\n\nEvery version has a major version, and they may have a minor version as well\n(indicated `<major>.<minor>`). The minor version should be incremented for\nchanges that don't affect the intended semantics of the proposal; otherwise, the\nmajor version should be incremented.\n",
