We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.\n\n> **Note:** In the years since releasing Lumen, PHP has made a variety of wonderful performance improvements. For this reason, along with the availability of [Laravel Octane](https://laravel.com/docs/octane), we no longer recommend that you begin new projects with Lumen. Instead, we recommend always beginning new projects with [Laravel](https://laravel.com).\n\n## Official Documentation\n\nDocumentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for considering contributing to Lumen! The contribution guide can be found in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/contributions).\n\n## Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIf you discover a security vulnerability within Lumen, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at taylor@laravel.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.\n\n## License\n\nThe Lumen framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n",
