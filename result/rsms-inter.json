Some trade-offs were made in order to make this typeface work really well at small sizes:\n\n- Early versions of Inter was not suitable for very large sizes because of some small-scale glyph optimizations (like \"pits\" and \"traps\") that help rasterization at small sizes but stand out and interfere at large sizes. However today Inter works well at large sizes and a [Display subfamily](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/tag/display-beta-1) is in the works for really large \"display\" sizes.\n\n- Rasterized at sizes below 12px, some stems\u2014like the horizontal center of \"E\", \"F\", or vertical center of \"m\"\u2014are drawn with two semi-opaque pixels instead of one solid. This is because we \"prioritize\" (optimize for) higher-density rasterizations. If we move these stems to an off-center position\u2014so that they can be drawn sharply at e.g. 11px\u2014text will be less legible at higher resolutions.\n\nInter is a [variable font](https://rsms.me/inter/#variable) and is in addition also distributed as a set of traditional distinct font files in the following styles:\n\n| Roman (upright) name | Italic name          | Weight\n| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------\n| Thin                 | Thin Italic          | 100\n| Extra Light          | Extra Light Italic   | 200\n| Light                | Light Italic         | 300\n| Regular              | Italic               | 400\n| Medium               | Medium Italic        | 500\n| Semi Bold            | Semi Bold Italic     | 600\n| Bold                 | Bold Italic          | 700\n| Extra Bold           | Extra Bold Italic    | 800\n| Black                | Black Italic         | 900\n\n",
