If you wish to\nreport a bug/problem/whatever, I welcome you to do on `the project issue tracker`_.\n\n.. _the project issue tracker: https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues\n\nYou can find out how to use fpm in the `documentation`_.\n\n.. _documentation: https://fpm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nYou can learn how to install fpm on your platform in the `installation guide`_.\n\n.. _installation guide: https://fpm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html\n\nProject Principles\n------------------\n\n* Community: If a newbie has a bad time, it's a bug.\n* Engineering: Make it work, then make it right, then make it fast.\n* Capabilities: If it doesn't do a thing today, we can make it do it tomorrow.\n\n\nBackstory\n---------\n\nSometimes packaging is done wrong (because you can't do it right for all\nsituations), but small tweaks can fix it.\n\nAnd sometimes, there isn't a package available for the tool you need.\n\nAnd sometimes if you ask \"How do I get python 3.9 on RHEL 8?\" some unhelpful\ntrolls will tell you to \"Use another distro\"\n\nFurther, job switches have me flipping between Ubuntu and CentOS. These use\ntwo totally different package systems with completely different packaging\npolicies and support tools. Learning both was painful and confusing. I want to\nsave myself (and you) that pain in the future.\n\nIt should be easy to say \"here's my install dir and here's some dependencies;\nplease make a package\"\n\nThe Solution - FPM\n------------------\n\nI wanted a simple way to create packages without needing to memorize too much.\n\nI wanted a tool to help me deliver software with minimal steps or training.\n\nThe goal of FPM is to be able to easily build platform-native packages.\n\nWith fpm, you can do many things, including:\n\n* Creating packages easily (deb, rpm, freebsd, etc)\n* Tweaking existing packages (removing files, changing metadata/dependencies)\n* Stripping pre/post/maintainer scripts from packages\n\n.. include: docs/installing\n\nThings that should work\n-----------------------\n\nSources:\n\n* gem (even autodownloaded for you)\n* python modules (autodownload for you)\n* pear (also downloads for you)\n* directories\n* tar(.gz) archives\n* rpm\n* deb\n* node packages (npm)\n* pacman (ArchLinux) packages\n\nTargets:\n\n* deb\n* rpm\n* solaris\n* freebsd\n* tar\n* directories\n* Mac OS X `.pkg` files (`osxpkg`)\n* pacman (ArchLinux) packages\n\n.. include: docs/contributing\n\n.. |Chat| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/irc-%23fpm%20on%20freenode-brightgreen.svg\n   :target: https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fpm\n.. |Gem| image:: https://img.shields.io/gem/v/fpm.svg\n   :target: https://rubygems.org/gems/fpm\n",
