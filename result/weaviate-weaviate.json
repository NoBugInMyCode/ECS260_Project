The core engine can run a 10-NN nearest neighbor search on millions of objects in milliseconds. See [benchmarks](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/benchmarks).\n\n### Flexibility\n\nWeaviate can **vectorize your data at import time**. Or, if you have already vectorized your data, you can **upload your own vectors** instead.\n\nModules give you the flexibility to tune Weaviate for your needs. More than two dozen modules connect you to popular services and model hubs such as [OpenAI](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai), [Cohere](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-cohere), [VoyageAI](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-voyageai) and [HuggingFace](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-huggingface). Use custom modules to work with your own models or third party services.\n\n### Production-readiness\n\nWeaviate is built with [scaling](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/cluster), [replication](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture), and [security](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/authentication) in mind so you can go smoothly from **rapid prototyping** to **production at scale**.\n\n### Beyond search\n\nWeaviate doesn't just power lightning-fast vector searches. Other superpowers include **recommendation**, **summarization**, and **integration with neural search frameworks**.\n\n## Who uses Weaviate?\n\n- **Software Engineers**\n\n  - Weaviate is an ML-first database engine\n  - Out-of-the-box modules for AI-powered searches, automatic classification, and LLM integration\n   - Full CRUD support\n   - Cloud-native, distributed system that runs well on Kubernetes\n   - Scales with your workloads\n\n- **Data Engineers**\n\n  - Weaviate is a fast, flexible vector database\n  - Use your own ML model or third party models\n  - Run locally or with an inference service\n\n- **Data Scientists**\n\n   - Seamless handover of Machine Learning models to engineers and MLOps\n   - Deploy and maintain your ML models in production reliably and efficiently\n   - Easily package custom trained models\n\n## What can you build with Weaviate?\n\nA Weaviate vector database can search text, images, or a combination of both. Fast vector search provides a foundation for chatbots, recommendation systems, summarizers, and classification systems.\n\nHere are some examples that show how Weaviate integrates with other AI and ML tools:\n\n### Use Weaviate with third party embeddings\n\n- [Cohere](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-cohere) ([blogpost](https://txt.cohere.com/embedding-archives-wikipedia/))\n- [Hugging Face](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-huggingface)\n- [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/vector_databases/weaviate)\n\n### Use Weaviate as a document store\n\n- [DocArray](https://docarray.jina.ai/advanced/document-store/weaviate/)\n- [Haystack](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/reference/integrations-weaviate#weaviatedocumentstore) ([blogpost](https://www.deepset.ai/weaviate-vector-search-engine-integration))\n\n### Use Weaviate as a memory backend\n\n- [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/master/docs/configuration/memory.md#weaviate-setup) ([blogpost](https://weaviate.io/blog/autogpt-and-weaviate))\n- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/weaviate) ([blogpost](https://weaviate.io/blog/combining-langchain-and-weaviate))\n- [LlamaIndex](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/integrations/vector_stores.html) ([blogpost](https://weaviate.io/blog/llamaindex-and-weaviate))\n- [OpenAI - ChatGPT retrieval plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/blob/main/docs/providers/weaviate/setup.md)\n\n### Demos\n\nThese demos are working applications that highlight some of Weaviate's capabilities. Their source code is available on GitHub.\n\n- [Verba, the Golden RAGtreiver](https://verba.weaviate.io) ([GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/verba))\n- [Healthsearch](https://healthsearch.weaviate.io) ([GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/healthsearch-demo))\n- [Awesome-Moviate](https://awesome-moviate.weaviate.io/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/awesome-moviate))\n\n## How can you connect to Weaviate?\n\nWeaviate exposes a [GraphQL API](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql) and a [REST API](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/rest). Starting in v1.23, a new [gRPC API](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/grpc) provides even faster access to your data.\n\nWeaviate provides client libraries for several popular languages:\n\n- [Python](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python)\n- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript)\n- [Go](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/go)\n- [Java](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/java)\n\nThere are also [community supported libraries](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/community) for additional languages.\n\n## Where can You learn more?\n\nFree, self-paced courses in [Weaviate Academy](https://weaviate.io/developers/academy) teach you how to use Weaviate. The [Tutorials repo](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials) has code for example projects. The [Recipes repo](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes) has even more project code to get you started.\n\nThe [Weaviate blog](https://weaviate.io/blog) and [podcast](https://weaviate.io/podcast) regularly post stories on Weaviate and AI.\n\nHere are some popular posts:\n\n### Blogs\n\n- [What to expect from Weaviate in 2023](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-to-expect-from-weaviate-in-2023)\n- [Why is vector search so fast?](https://weaviate.io/blog/Why-is-Vector-Search-so-fast)\n- [Cohere Multilingual ML Models with Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/blog/Cohere-multilingual-with-weaviate)\n- [Vamana vs. HNSW - Exploring ANN algorithms Part 1](https://weaviate.io/blog/ann-algorithms-vamana-vs-hnsw)\n- [HNSW+PQ - Exploring ANN algorithms Part 2.1](https://weaviate.io/blog/ann-algorithms-hnsw-pq)\n- [The Tile Encoder - Exploring ANN algorithms Part 2.2](https://weaviate.io/blog/ann-algorithms-tiles-enocoder)\n- [How GPT4.0 and other Large Language Models Work](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-are-llms)\n- [Monitoring Weaviate in Production](https://weaviate.io/blog/monitoring-weaviate-in-production)\n- [The ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin - Weaviate as a Long-term Memory Store for Generative AI](https://weaviate.io/blog/weaviate-retrieval-plugin)\n- [Combining LangChain and Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/blog/combining-langchain-and-weaviate)\n- [How to build an Image Search Application with Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/blog/how-to-build-an-image-search-application-with-weaviate)\n- [Cohere Multilingual ML Models with Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/blog/cohere-multilingual-with-weaviate)\n- [Building Multimodal AI in TypeScript](https://weaviate.io/blog/multimodal-search-in-typescript)\n- [Giving Auto-GPT Long-Term Memory with Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/blog/autogpt-and-weaviate)\n\n### Podcasts\n\n- [Neural Magic in Weaviate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leGgjIQkVYo)\n- [BERTopic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwXOaHanfUU)\n- [Jina AI's Neural Search Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6MD0tWl0SM)\n\n### Other reading\n\n- [Weaviate is an open-source search engine powered by ML, vectors, graphs, and GraphQL (ZDNet)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/weaviate-an-open-source-search-engine-powered-by-machine-learning-vectors-graphs-and-graphql/)\n- [Weaviate, an ANN Database with CRUD support (DB-Engines.com)](https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/87)\n- [A sub-50ms neural search with DistilBERT and Weaviate (Towards Datascience)](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-sub-50ms-neural-search-with-distilbert-and-weaviate-4857ae390154)\n- [Getting Started with Weaviate Python Library (Towards Datascience)](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-weaviate-python-client-e85d14f19e4f)\n\n## Join our community!\n\nAt Weaviate, we love to connect with our community.
