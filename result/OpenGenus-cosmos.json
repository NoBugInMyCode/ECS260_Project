This provides solutions in various languages spanning `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `Swift`, `Python`, `Go` and others.\n\nThis work is maintained by a community of hundreds of people and is a _massive collaborative effort_ to bring the readily available coding knowledge **offline**.\n\n> **Many coders ask me how to improve their own performances. I cannot say anything except \"solve and review and prepare your library\"** - _Uwi Tenpen_\n\nMake your fundamentals in Algorithms and Data Structure with these free resources:\n\n* [**50+** Linked List Problems](https://iq.opengenus.org/list-of-linked-list-problems/)\n* [**50+** Array Problems](https://iq.opengenus.org/list-of-array-problems/)\n* [**50+** Binary Tree Problems](https://iq.opengenus.org/list-of-binary-tree-problems/)\n* [**100+** Dynamic Programming (DP) Problems](https://iq.opengenus.org/list-of-dynamic-programming-problems/)\n\n# Cosmic Structure\n\nFollowing is the high-level structure of cosmos:\n* [Artificial intelligence](/code/artificial_intelligence) :robot:\n* [Backtracking](/code/backtracking)\n* [Bit manipulation](/code/bit_manipulation)\n* [Cellular automaton](/code/cellular_automaton) \ud83d\udc1a\n* [Compression algorithms](/code/compression) \ud83d\udddc\ufe0f\n* [Computational geometry](/code/computational_geometry) :gear:\n* [Cryptography](/code/cryptography)\n* [Data structures](/code/data_structures)\n* [Design pattern](/code/design_pattern)\n* [Divide conquering](/code/divide_conquer) \u2797\n* [Dynamic programming](/code/dynamic_programming)\n* [Graph algorithms](/code/graph_algorithms) \ud83d\udcc8\n* [Greedy algorithms](/code/greedy_algorithms) \ud83d\udcb0\n* [Mathematical algorithms](/code/mathematical_algorithms)  :1234:\n* [Networking](/code/networking)  :globe_with_meridians:\n* [Numerical analysis](/code/numerical_analysis)  :chart_with_upwards_trend:\n* [Online challenges](/code/online_challenges)\n* [Operating system](/code/operating_system) \ud83d\udcbb\n* [Quantum algorithms](/code/quantum_algorithms)  :cyclone:\n* [Randomized algorithms](/code/randomized_algorithms)  :slot_machine:\n* [Searching](/code/search) \ud83d\udd0e\n* [Selecting](/code/selection_algorithms)\n* [Sorting](/code/sorting)\n* [Square root decomposition](/code/square_root_decomposition)\n* [String algorithms](/code/string_algorithms) \ud83e\uddf5\n* [Unclassified](/code/unclassified) \ud83d\udc7b\n\nEach type has several hundreds of problems with solutions in several languages spanning `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Go` and others.\n\n# Maintainers\n\nThis is a massive collaboration. Hence, to keep the quality intact and drive the vision in the proper direction, we have maintainers.\n\n> Maintainers are your friends forever. They are vastly different from moderators.\n\nCurrently, we have **5 active maintainers** and we are expanding quickly.\n\nThe task of maintainers is to review pull requests, suggest further quality additions and keep the work up to date with the current state of the world. \ud83c\udf0d\n\n[Check out our current maintainers](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/wiki/maintainers)\n\n# Contributors\n\nThe success of our vision to bring knowledge offline depends on you. Even a small contribution helps. All forms of contributions are highly welcomed and valued.\n\nCurrently, we have over **1000+ contributors** in Cosmos and **over 2K+ contributors** in sister projects of Cosmos.\n\nWhen you contribute, your name with a link (if available) is added to our [contributors list](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/wiki/contributors).\n\nYou can contribute by writing `code`, documentation in the form of `installation guides` and `style guides`, making Cosmos search friendly and many others. There are endless possibilities.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to take a look at this [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/wiki/contribute) before you make Cosmos better.\n\nYou may, also, refer to the available [style guides](/guides/coding_style) before contributing code.\n\n# License\n\nWe believe in freedom and improvement.
