Here's how:\n\n1. Download the latest Build.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/releases)\n2. Load the extension by pasting `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar, and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).\n3. Drag the folder that contains the code (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the \"Load unpacked\" button and locate the folder.\n4. That's it, you should now be able to use Screenity locally. [Follow these instructions](#enabling-save-to-google-drive) to set up the Google Drive integration.\n\n## Creating a development version\n\n> \u2757\ufe0f Note that the license has changed to [GPLv3](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/blob/master/LICENSE) for the current MV3 version (Screenity version 3.0.0 and higher).

Load the extension by going to `chrome://extensions/` , and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).\n6. Click on `Load unpacked extension`.\n7. Select the `build` folder.\n\n### Enabling Save to Google Drive\n\nTo enable the Google Drive Upload (authorization consent screen) you must change the client_id in the manifest.json file with your linked extension key.\n\nYou can create it accessing [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and selecting Create Credential > OAuth Client ID > Chrome App. To create a persistent extension key, you can follow the steps detailed [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/key).\n\n## Libraries used\n\n- [FFmpeg WASM](https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/) for editing and encoding videos\n- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) with the [Selfie Segmentation](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/01/body-segmentation.html) model\n- [Fabric.js](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js) for drawing and annotating\n- [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) for the UI components\n- [react-color](https://uiwjs.github.io/react-color/) for the color wheel\n- [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage) to help store videos offline with IndexedDB\n- [Wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer.xyz/) to create audio waveforms in the popup and the editor\n- [React Advanced Cropper](https://advanced-cropper.github.io/react-advanced-cropper/) for the cropping UI in the editor\n- [fix-webm-duration](https://github.com/yusitnikov/fix-webm-duration) to add missing metadata to WEBM files\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- Thanks to [HelpKit](https://www.helpkit.so/) for sponsoring this project by hosting the [Screenity Help Center](https://help.screenity.io/).\n- Thanks to [Mei Xuan](https://www.behance.net/meixuanloo) for helping with the Chinese translation of the extension.\n\nIf you need any help, or want to become a Screenity expert, you can browse articles and guides in the [help center](https://help.screenity.io).
