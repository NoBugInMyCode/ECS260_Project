        "readme": "# Swift Package Manager Project\n\nThe Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing distribution of source code, aimed at making it easy to share your code and reuse others\u2019 code. The tool directly addresses the challenges of compiling and linking Swift packages, managing dependencies, versioning, and supporting flexible distribution and collaboration models.\n\nWe\u2019ve designed the system to make it easy to share packages on services like GitHub, but packages are also great for private personal development, sharing code within a team, or at any other granularity.\n\nSwift Package Manager includes a build system that can build for macOS and Linux. Starting with Xcode 11, Xcode integrates with SwiftPM to provide support for including packages in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications.\n\nThe [SourceKit-LSP](https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp) project leverages libSwiftPM and provides [Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org/) implementation for editors that support LSP.\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n* [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n* [Documentation](#documentation)\n* [System Requirements](#system-requirements)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n* [Reporting issues](#reporting-issues)\n* [License](#license)\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPlease use [this guide](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) for learning package manager basics.\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor Quick Help use the `swift package --help` command.\n\nFor documentation on using Swift Package Manager, creating packages, and more, see the [documentation directory](Documentation/README.md).\n\nFor documentation on developing the Swift Package Manager itself, see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nFor detailed documentation on the package manifest API, see [PackageDescription API](https://docs.swift.org/package-manager/PackageDescription/index.html).\n\nFor release notes with information about changes between versions, see the [release notes](Documentation/ReleaseNotes).\n\n---\n\n## System Requirements\n\nThe package manager\u2019s system requirements are the same as [those for Swift](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/blob/main/docs/HowToGuides/GettingStarted.md#system-requirements) with the caveat that the package manager requires Git at runtime as well as build-time.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nThe package manager is available as part the Swift toolchains available on [Swift.org](https://swift.org/download/)) including snapshots for the latest versions built from `main` branch. For installation instructions for downloaded snapshots, please see the [Getting Started](https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift) section of [Swift.org](https://swift.org).\n\nThe Swift Package Manager is also included in Xcode 8.0 and all subsequent releases.\n\nYou can verify your installation by typing `swift package --version` in a terminal:\n\n```sh\n$ swift package --version\nApple Swift Package Manager - ...\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere are several ways to contribute to Swift Package Manager. To learn about the policies, best practices that govern contributions to the Swift project and instructions for setting up the development environment please read the [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).  \n\nThe Swift package manager uses [llbuild](https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild) as the underlying build system for compiling source files. It is also open source and part of the Swift project.\n\n---\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nIf you have any trouble with the package manager, help is available. We recommend:\n\n* The [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/c/development/swiftpm/),\n* SwiftPM's [bug tracker](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/issues)\n\nWhen reporting an issue please follow the bug reporting guidelines, they can be found in [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-issues).\n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable sharing your question with the list, contact details for the code owners can be found in [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS); however, Swift Forums is usually the best place to go for help.\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2015 - 2024 Apple Inc. and the Swift project authors.
