A stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic\n> vimmer\u2014envious of the features of modern text editors\u2014spirals into\n> despair before he succumbs to the [dark side][evil-mode]. This is his config.\n\nDoom is a configuration framework for [GNU Emacs] tailored for Emacs bankruptcy\nveterans who want less framework in their frameworks, a modicum of stability\n(and reproducibility) from their package manager, and the performance of a hand\nrolled config (or better). It can be a foundation for your own config or a\nresource for Emacs enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite operating\nsystem.\n\nIts design is guided by these mantras:\n\n+ **Gotta go fast.** Startup and run-time performance are priorities. Doom goes\n  beyond by modifying packages to be snappier and load lazier.\n+ **Close to metal.** There's less between you and vanilla Emacs by design.\n  That's less to grok and less to work around when you tinker. Internals ought\n  to be written as if reading them were part of Doom's UX, and it is!\n+ **Opinionated, but not stubborn.** Doom is about reasonable defaults and\n  curated opinions, but use as little or as much of it as you like.\n+ **Your system, your rules.** You know better. At least, Doom hopes so! It\n  won't *automatically* install system dependencies (and will force plugins not\n  to either). Rely on `doom doctor` to tell you what's missing.\n+ **Nix/Guix is a great idea!** The Emacs ecosystem is temperamental. Things\n  break and they break often. Disaster recovery should be a priority! Doom's\n  package management should be declarative and your private config reproducible,\n  and comes with a means to roll back releases and updates (still a WIP).\n  \nCheck out [the FAQ][FAQ] for answers to common questions about the project.\n\n\n# Features\n- Minimalistic good looks inspired by modern editors.\n- Curated and sane defaults for many packages, (major) OSes, and Emacs itself.\n- A modular organizational structure for separating concerns in your config.\n- A standard library designed to simplify your elisp bike shedding.\n- A declarative [package management system][package-management] (powered by\n  [straight.el]) with a command line interface. Install packages from anywhere,\n  not just (M)ELPA, and pin them to any commit.\n- Optional vim emulation powered by [evil-mode], including ports of popular vim\n  plugins like [vim-sneak], [vim-easymotion], [vim-unimpaired] and\n  [more][ported-vim-plugins]!\n- Opt-in LSP integration for many languages, using [lsp-mode] or [eglot]\n- Support for *many* programming languages. Includes syntax highlighting,\n  linters/checker integration, inline code evaluation, code completion (where\n  possible), REPLs, documentation lookups, snippets, and more!\n- Support for *many* tools, like docker, pass, ansible, terraform, and more.\n- A Spacemacs-esque [keybinding scheme][bindings], centered around leader\n  and localleader prefix keys (<kbd>SPC</kbd> and <kbd>SPC</kbd><kbd>m</kbd> for\n  evil users, <kbd>C-c</kbd> and <kbd>C-c l</kbd> for vanilla users).\n- A rule-based [popup manager][popup-system] to control how temporary buffers\n  are displayed (and disposed of).\n- Per-file indentation style detection and [editorconfig] integration. Let\n  someone else argue about tabs vs **_spaces_**.\n- Project-management tools and framework-specific minor modes with their own\n  snippets libraries.\n- Project search (and replace) utilities, powered by [ripgrep] and [ivy] or\n  [helm].\n- Isolated and persistent workspaces (also substitutes for vim tabs).\n- Support for Chinese and Japanese input systems.\n- Save a snapshot of your shell environment to a file for Emacs to load at\n  startup. No more struggling to get Emacs to inherit your `PATH`, among other\n  things.\n\n\n# Prerequisites\n- Git 2.23+\n- Emacs 27.1\u201329.4 (**Recommended: 29.4 +\n  [native-comp](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GccEmacs)**)\n- [ripgrep] 11.0+\n- GNU `find`\n- *OPTIONAL:* [fd] 7.3.0+ (improves file indexing performance for some commands)\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Unstable and pre-release builds of Emacs -- which end in `.50`, `.60`, or\n> `.9X` (e.g. `28.1.91`) -- **are not officially supported**. There *is* some\n> effort to support Emacs HEAD, however. [Follow this Discourse\n> post](https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/3241) for details.\n \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Doom is comprised of [~150 optional modules][Modules], some of which may have\n> additional dependencies. [Visit their documentation][Modules] or run `bin/doom\n> doctor` to check for any that you may have missed.\n\n\n# Install\n``` sh\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs\n~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install\n```\n\nThen [read our Getting Started guide][getting-started] to be walked through\ninstalling, configuring and maintaining Doom Emacs.\n\nIt's a good idea to add `~/.config/emacs/bin` to your `PATH`! Other `bin/doom`\ncommands you should know about:\n\n+ `doom sync` to synchronize your private config with Doom by installing missing\n  packages, removing orphaned packages, and regenerating caches. Run this\n  whenever you modify your private `init.el` or `packages.el`, or install/remove\n  an Emacs package through your OS package manager (e.g. mu4e or agda).\n+ `doom upgrade` to update Doom to the latest release & all installed packages.\n+ `doom doctor` to diagnose common issues with your system and config.\n+ `doom env` to dump a snapshot of your shell environment to a file that Doom\n  will load at startup. This allows Emacs to inherit your `PATH`, among other\n  things.\n\n\n# Roadmap\nDoom is an active and ongoing project. To make that development more\ntransparent, its roadmap (and other concerns) are published across three github\nproject boards and a newsletter:\n\n+ [Development Roadmap](https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/development-roadmap/42):\n  roughly outlines our goals between release milestones and their progress.\n+ [Plugins under review](https://github.com/orgs/doomemacs/projects/5):\n  lists plugins we are watching and considering for inclusion, and what their\n  status for inclusion is. Please consult this list before requesting new\n  packages/features.\n+ [Upstream bugs](https://github.com/orgs/doomemacs/projects/7): lists\n  issues that originate from elsewhere, and whether or not we have local\n  workarounds or temporary fixes for them.\n+ ~~Doom's newsletter~~ (not finished) will contain changelogs in between\n  releases.\n  \n\n# Getting help\nEmacs is no journey of a mere thousand miles. You _will_ run into problems and\nmysterious errors. When you do, here are some places you can look for help:\n\n+ [Our documentation][documentation] covers many use cases.\n  + [The Configuration section][configuration] covers how to configure Doom and\n    its packages.\n  + [The Package Management section][package-management] covers how to install\n    and disable packages.\n  + [This section][bin/doom] explains the `bin/doom` script's most important\n    commands.\n  + [This section][common-mistakes] lists some common configuration mistakes new\n    users make, when migrating a config from another distro or their own.\n  + [This answer][change-theme] shows you how to add your own themes to your\n    private config.\n  + [This answer][change-font] shows you how to change the default font.\n  + Your issue may be documented in the [FAQ].\n+ With Emacs built-in help system documentation is a keystroke away:\n  + For functions: <kbd>SPC h f</kbd> or <kbd>C-h f</kbd>\n  + For variables: <kbd>SPC h v</kbd> or <kbd>C-h v</kbd>\n  + For a keybind: <kbd>SPC h k</kbd> or <kbd>C-h k</kbd>\n  + To search available keybinds: <kbd>SPC h b b</kbd> or <kbd>C-h b b</kbd>\n+ Run `bin/doom doctor` to detect common issues with your development\n  environment and private config.\n+ Check out the [FAQ] or [Discourse FAQs][discourse-faq], in case your question\n  has already been answered.\n+ Search [Doom's issue tracker](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues) in case your issue was already\n  reported.\n+ Hop on [our Discord server][discord]; it's active and friendly! Keep an eye on\n  the #announcements channel, where I announce breaking updates and releases.\n\n\n# Contribute\n[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) \n[![Elisp styleguide](https://img.shields.io/badge/elisp-style%20guide-purple?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide)\n[![Donate on liberapay](https://img.shields.io/badge/liberapay-donate-1.svg?style=flat-square&logo=liberapay&color=blue)][liberapay]\n[![Donate on paypal](https://img.shields.io/badge/paypal-donate-1?style=flat-square&logo=paypal&color=blue)][paypal]\n\nDoom is a labor of love and incurable madness, but I'm only one guy. Doom\nwouldn't be where it is today without your help. I welcome contributions of any\nkind!\n\n+ I :heart: pull requests and bug reports (see the [Contributing\n  Guidelines][contribute])!\n+ Don't hesitate to [tell me my Elisp-fu\n  sucks](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/new/choose), but please\n  tell me why.\n+ Hop on [our Discord server][Discord] and say hi! Help others, hang out or talk\n  to me about Emacs, gamedev, programming, physics, pixel art, anime, gaming --\n  anything you like. Nourish this lonely soul.\n+ If you'd like to support my work financially, buy me a drink through\n  [liberapay] or [paypal]. My work contends with studies, adventures in indie\n  gamedev and freelance work. Donations help me allocate more time to my Emacs\n  and OSS capers.\n\n\n[contribute]: docs/contributing.org\n[discord]: https://doomemacs.org/discord\n[discourse]: https://discourse.doomemacs.org\n[discourse-faq]: https://discourse.doomemacs.org/tag/faq\n[documentation]: docs/index.org\n[faq]: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/master/docs/faq.org\n[getting-started]: docs/getting_started.org\n[install]: docs/getting_started.org#install\n[backtrace]: docs/getting_started.org#how-to-extract-a-backtrace-from-an-error\n[configuration]: docs/getting_started.org#configuring-doom\n[package-management]: docs/getting_started.org#package-management\n[bin/doom]: docs/getting_started.org#the-bindoom-utility\n[common-mistakes]: docs/getting_started.org#common-mistakes-when-configuring-doom-emacs\n[change-theme]: docs/faq.org#how-do-i-change-the-theme\n[change-font]: docs/faq.org#how-do-i-change-the-fonts\n[modules]: docs/modules.org\n[popup-system]: modules/ui/popup/README.org\n[screenshots]: https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/tree/screenshots#emacsd-screenshots\n\n[bindings]: modules/config/default/+evil-bindings.el\n[editorconfig]: http://editorconfig.org/\n[evil-mode]: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil\n[fd]: https://github.com/sharkdp/fd\n[gnu emacs]: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\n[helm]: https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm\n[ivy]: https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper\n[lsp-mode]: https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode\n[eglot]: https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot\n[nix]: https://nixos.org\n[ported-vim-plugins]: modules/editor/evil/README.org#ported-vim-plugins\n[ripgrep]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\n[straight.el]: https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el\n[vim-easymotion]: https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion\n[vim-lion]: https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-lion\n[vim-sneak]: https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak\n[vim-unimpaired]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired\n\n[liberapay]: https://liberapay.com/hlissner/donate\n[paypal]: https://paypal.me/henriklissner/10\n",
