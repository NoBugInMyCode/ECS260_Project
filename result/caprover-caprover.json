Remove CapRover and your apps keep working!\n\n\u2714 Docker Swarm under the hood for containerization and clustering\n\n\u2714 Nginx (fully customizable template) under the hood for load-balancing\n\n\u2714 Let's Encrypt under the hood for free SSL (HTTPS)\n\n### Seriously! Who should care about CapRover?\n\n-   A [web] developer who does not like spending hours and days setting up a server, build tools, sending code to server, build it, get an SSL certificate, install it, update nginx over and over again.\n-   A developer who uses expensive services like Heroku, Microsoft Azure and etc. And is interested in reducing their cost by 50x (Heroku charges 250USD/month for their 2gb instance, the same server is 5$ on Hetzner!!)\n-   Someone who prefers to write more of `showResults(getUserList())` and not much of `$ apt-get install libstdc++6 > /dev/null`\n-   A developer who likes installing MariaDB, MySQL, MongoDB and etc on their server by selecting from a dropdown and clicking on install!\n-   How much server/docker/linux knowledge is required to set up a CapRover server? Answer: Knowledge of Copy & Paste!! Head over to \"Getting Started\" for information on what to copy & paste ;-)\n\n## Learn More!\n\nFor more details and documentation, please visit https://CapRover.com/\n\n## Contributors\n\nCapRover exists thanks to all the great people who have contributed to this project.
