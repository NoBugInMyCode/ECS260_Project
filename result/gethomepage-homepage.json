See the [Settings](https://gethomepage.dev/configs/settings/) page for more information.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nFor configuration options, examples and more, [please check out the homepage documentation](http://gethomepage.dev).\n\n## Security Notice \ud83d\udd12\n\nPlease note that when using features such as widgets, Homepage can access personal information (for example from your home automation system) and Homepage currently does not (and is not planned to) include any authentication layer itself. Thus, we recommend homepage be deployed behind a reverse proxy including authentication, SSL etc, and / or behind a VPN.\n\n## With Docker\n\nUsing docker compose:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  homepage:\n    image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest\n    container_name: homepage\n    environment:\n      PUID: 1000 # optional, your user id\n      PGID: 1000 # optional, your group id\n    ports:\n      - 3000:3000\n    volumes:\n      - /path/to/config:/app/config # Make sure your local config directory exists\n      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # optional, for docker integrations\n    restart: unless-stopped\n```\n\nor docker run:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name homepage \\\n  -e PUID=1000 \\\n  -e PGID=1000 \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -v /path/to/config:/app/config \\\n  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \\\n  --restart unless-stopped \\\n  ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest\n```\n\n## From Source\n\nFirst, clone the repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage.git\n```\n\nThen install dependencies and build the production bundle (I'm using pnpm here, you can use npm or yarn if you like):\n\n```bash\npnpm install\npnpm build\n```\n\nIf this is your first time starting, copy the `src/skeleton` directory to `config/` to populate initial example config files.\n\nFinally, run the server in production mode:\n\n```bash\npnpm start\n```\n\n# Configuration\n\nPlease refer to the [homepage documentation website](https://gethomepage.dev/) for more information. Everything you need to know about configuring Homepage is there. Please read everything carefully before asking for help, as most questions are answered there or are simple YAML configuration issues.\n\n# Development\n\nInstall NPM packages, this project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (and so should you!):\n\n```bash\npnpm install\n```\n\nStart the development server:\n\n```bash\npnpm dev\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start.\n\nThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, see their documentation for more information.\n\n# Documentation\n\nThe homepage documentation is available at [https://gethomepage.dev/](https://gethomepage.dev/).\n\nHomepage uses Material for MkDocs for documentation. To run the documentation locally, first install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nThen run the development server:\n\n```bash\nmkdocs serve # or build, to build the static site\n```\n\n# Support & Suggestions\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, or general issues, please start a discussion on the [Discussions](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage/discussions) page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIn addition to the docs, the [troubleshooting guide](https://gethomepage.dev/troubleshooting/) can help reveal many basic config or network issues. If you're having a problem, it's a good place to start.\n\n## Contributing & Contributors\n\nContributions are welcome! Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information.\n\nThanks to the over 200 contributors who have helped make this project what it is today!\n\nEspecially huge thanks to [@shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon), who has been the backbone of this community from the very start.\n",
