Here are _free and curated_ technical interview preparation materials for busy engineers, brought to you by me, the author of [Blind 75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU). Over 1,000,000 people have benefitted from this handbook!\n\nBesides the usual algorithm questions, other **awesome** stuff includes:\n\n- [Best practice questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/) for coding interviews\n- [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) - the next evolution of Blind 75, bigger and better\n- [How to prepare](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-prep/) for coding interviews\n- [Coding interview best practices](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-cheatsheet/) - Straight-to-the-point Do's and Don'ts\n- [Algorithm cheatsheets and tips](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/) categorized by topic\n- [Step-by-step Software Engineer resume guide](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/) to prepare a FAANG-ready resume\n- [Behavioral questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview-questions/) asked by the top tech companies\n- [Front end interview preparation](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com)\n\nHelp from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!\n\n## Why would you read this?\n\nThis repository has **practical** content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful.\n\nThe information in this repository is condensed. Ultimately, the key to succeeding in technical interviews is consistent practice and I don't want to bore you with too many words. I tell you the minimum you need to know on how to go about navigating the interview process, you go and practice and land your dream job.\n\n## Who is this for?\n\nAnybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, or anyone who wants to be better at technical interviewing.\n\n---\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <h3>\ud83d\udca1 Stop grinding mindlessly!

The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top-quality curated content directly for your consumption.\n\nAlso, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions and lack coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. \ud83d\ude0e\n\n## Looking for interview courses?\n\n### [AlgoMonster](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1873647&u=3114753&m=114505&urllink=&afftrack=)\n\nAlgoMonster aims to help you ace the technical interview **in the shortest time possible**. By Google engineers, AlgoMonster uses a data-driven approach to teach you the most useful key question patterns and has contents to help you quickly revise basic data structures and algorithms. Best of all, AlgoMonster is not subscription-based - pay a one-time fee and get **lifetime access**.

The course allows you to practice selected questions in Java, Python, C++, JavaScript and also provides sample solutions in those languages. **Learn and understand patterns, not memorize answers!** [**Get lifetime access today \u2192**](https://designgurus.org/link/kJSIoU?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesigngurus.org%2Fcourse%3Fcourseid%3Dgrokking-the-coding-interview)\n\n## Looking for Front End content?\n\nFront-end-related content has been moved to a separate website - [Front End Interview Handbook](https://frontendinterviewhandbook.com).\n\n## Looking for System Design content?\n\nWe're still working on System Design content. In the meanwhile, check out [ByteByteGo's System Design Interview course](https://bytebytego.com?fpr=techinterviewhandbook) or Design Gurus' [Grokking the System Design Interview course](https://designgurus.org/link/kJSIoU?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesigngurus.org%2Fcourse%3Fcourseid%3Dgrokking-the-system-design-interview), which in our opinion are among the most useful resources for getting started on system design interviews preparation.\n\n## Contents\n\nA [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) website has been created to provide a better reading experience.

It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that can be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere are no formal contributing guidelines at the moment as things are still in flux and we might find a better approach to structure content as we go along.
