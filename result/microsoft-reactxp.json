We recommend alternatives such as [React Native for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/). The ReactXP github project will be put into \u201carchive\u201d mode and will remain available in read-only form for the benefit of those who are still using it within older projects, but no new versions will be published.\r\n\r\n## Why ReactXP\r\nWith React and React Native, your web app can share most of its logic with your iOS and Android apps, but the view layer needs to be implemented separately for each platform. We have taken this a step further and developed a thin cross-platform layer we call ReactXP. If you write your app to this abstraction, you can share your view definitions, styles and animations across multiple target platforms. Of course, you can still provide platform-specific UI variants, but this can be done selectively where desired.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nThe [samples](/samples) directory contains a minimal \u201cHello World\u201d app that demonstrates some basic ReactXP functionality. You can use this as a starting point. Just follow the build instructions in the README file.\r\n\r\nAlso included in the samples directory is the [RXPTest app](/samples/RXPTest) which attempts to exercise all of the functionality of ReactXP. It is a good source to consult for sample usage of APIs, components, and props.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about ReactXP and its APIs from the [ReactXP official Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/docs/getting-started.html).\r\n\r\nUse the command-line tool called [create-rx-app](https://github.com/a-tarasyuk/create-rx-app) to create a starter project.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install create-rx-app -g\r\ncreate-rx-app AppName\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpx create-rx-app AppName\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default the project will be created in TypeScript. However if you prefer JavaScript instead, add `--javascript` when creating the project.\r\n\r\nThis will create a directory called **AppName** inside the current working directory. Inside **AppName**, this will generate the initial project structure and install all of its dependencies. Once this installation is done, there are some commands you can run in the project directory:\r\n\r\n- `npm run start:web` - runs the Web version of the app in the development mode\r\n- `npm run build:web` - builds the Web version of the app for production to the **dist-web** folder\r\n- `npm run start:ios` - runs the iOS version of the app and attempts to open in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed\r\n- `npm run start:android` - runs the Android version of the app and attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator\r\n- `npm run start:windows` - runs the Windows version of the app\r\n- `npm start:rn-dev-server` - runs react native (RN) development server\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n* [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/) ([Setup Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/))\r\n* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) ([Setup Instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started))\r\n\r\n## ESLint rules\r\n\r\n> [TSLint will be deprecated some time in 2019](https://github.com/palantir/tslint)\r\n\r\nIf you plan to migrate your projects from TSLint to ESlint and want to continue using the [_rules_](https://github.com/microsoft/reactxp/tree/master/src/tslint) to automate search common problems in *ReactXP* usage, you can use [eslint-plugin-reactxp](https://github.com/a-tarasyuk/eslint-plugin-reactxp).\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe welcome contributions to ReactXP. See the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for how to help out.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details\r\n",
