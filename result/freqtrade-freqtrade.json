However, this is a great way to control your bot. More details and the full command list on the [documentation](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/latest/telegram-usage/)\n\n- `/start`: Starts the trader.\n- `/stop`: Stops the trader.\n- `/stopentry`: Stop entering new trades.\n- `/status <trade_id>|[table]`: Lists all or specific open trades.\n- `/profit [<n>]`: Lists cumulative profit from all finished trades, over the last n days.\n- `/forceexit <trade_id>|all`: Instantly exits the given trade (Ignoring `minimum_roi`).\n- `/fx <trade_id>|all`: Alias to `/forceexit`\n- `/performance`: Show performance of each finished trade grouped by pair\n- `/balance`: Show account balance per currency.\n- `/daily <n>`: Shows profit or loss per day, over the last n days.\n- `/help`: Show help message.\n- `/version`: Show version.\n\n## Development branches\n\nThe project is currently setup in two main branches:\n\n- `develop` - This branch has often new features, but might also contain breaking changes. We try hard to keep this branch as stable as possible.\n- `stable` - This branch contains the latest stable release. This branch is generally well tested.\n- `feat/*` - These are feature branches, which are being worked on heavily. Please don't use these unless you want to test a specific feature.\n\n## Support\n\n### Help / Discord\n\nFor any questions not covered by the documentation or for further information about the bot, or to simply engage with like-minded individuals, we encourage you to join the Freqtrade [discord server](https://discord.gg/p7nuUNVfP7).\n\n### [Bugs / Issues](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/issues?q=is%3Aissue)\n\nIf you discover a bug in the bot, please\n[search the issue tracker](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/issues?q=is%3Aissue)\nfirst. If it hasn't been reported, please\n[create a new issue](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/issues/new/choose) and\nensure you follow the template guide so that the team can assist you as\nquickly as possible.\n\nFor every [issue](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/issues/new/choose) created, kindly follow up and mark satisfaction or reminder to close issue when equilibrium ground is reached.\n\n--Maintain github's [community policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct)--\n\n### [Feature Requests](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/labels/enhancement)\n\nHave you a great idea to improve the bot you want to share? Please,\nfirst search if this feature was not [already discussed](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/labels/enhancement).\nIf it hasn't been requested, please\n[create a new request](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/issues/new/choose)\nand ensure you follow the template guide so that it does not get lost\nin the bug reports.\n\n### [Pull Requests](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/pulls)\n\nFeel like the bot is missing a feature? We welcome your pull requests!\n\nPlease read the\n[Contributing document](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nto understand the requirements before sending your pull-requests.\n\nCoding is not a necessity to contribute - maybe start with improving the documentation?\nIssues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/labels/good%20first%20issue) can be good first contributions, and will help get you familiar with the codebase.\n\n**Note** before starting any major new feature work, *please open an issue describing what you are planning to do* or talk to us on [discord](https://discord.gg/p7nuUNVfP7) (please use the #dev channel for this). This will ensure that interested parties can give valuable feedback on the feature, and let others know that you are working on it.\n\n**Important:** Always create your PR against the `develop` branch, not `stable`.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Up-to-date clock\n\nThe clock must be accurate, synchronized to a NTP server very frequently to avoid problems with communication to the exchanges.\n\n### Minimum hardware required\n\nTo run this bot we recommend you a cloud instance with a minimum of:\n\n- Minimal (advised) system requirements: 2GB RAM, 1GB disk space, 2vCPU\n\n### Software requirements\n\n- [Python >= 3.10](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)\n- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)\n- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)\n- [TA-Lib](https://ta-lib.github.io/ta-lib-python/)\n- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation.html) (Recommended)\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) (Recommended)\n",
