For [RPM](http://bootes.ethz.ch/fonts/rpm/), [DEB](http://bootes.ethz.ch/fonts/deb/) based systems, feel free to try the linked URLs for individual fonts. Others can also use the [webservice](http://bootes.ethz.ch/fonts/).\n\n## Download All Google Fonts\n\nYou can download all Google Fonts in a simple ZIP snapshot (over 1GB) from <https://github.com/google/fonts/archive/main.zip>\n\n#### Sync With Git\n\nYou can also sync the collection with git so that you can update by only fetching what has changed. To learn how to use git, GitHub provides [illustrated guides](https://guides.github.com), a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GitHubGuides), and an [interactive learning site](https://skills.github.com/).\nFree, open-source git applications are available for [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows) and [Mac OS X](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/mac).\n\n## License\n\nIt is important to always read the license for every font that you use.\nEach font family directory contains the appropriate license file for the fonts in that directory.\nThe fonts files themselves also contain licensing and authorship metadata.\n\nMost of the fonts in the collection use the SIL Open Font License, v1.1.\nSome fonts use the Apache 2 license.\nThe Ubuntu fonts use the Ubuntu Font License v1.0.\n\nThe SIL Open Font License has an option for copyright holders to include a Reserved Font Name requirement, and this option is used with some of the fonts.\nIf you modify those fonts, please take care of this important detail.\n\n## Source Files\n\nSource files for each family are often available from the designer, or from [github.com/googlefonts](https://github.com/googlefonts)\n\nThese fonts are usually the result of collaborative projects, where you are invited to discuss issues with the designers and even contribute to their ongoing development.\n\nWhen customizing or remixing fonts, please do contact the designers to understand what they might need in order to include your improvements.\n\nMost of all: Enjoy the fonts!\n\n\u2013 The Google Fonts team\n",
