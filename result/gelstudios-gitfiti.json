Also, the generated script assumes you are using public-key authentication with git.\n\n### Pixel Art\n\n![pixel art examples](https://raw.github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti/master/pixels-large.png \"pixel art\")  \nIncluded \"art\" from left to right: kitty, oneup, oneup2, hackerschool, octocat, octocat2\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Create a new github repo to store your handiwork.\n2. Run `gitfiti.py` and follow the prompts for username, art selection, offset, and repo name.\n\nFor Python 3, use `python3`.\n\n```console\n    $ python3 ./gitfiti.py\n\n              _ __  _____ __  _\n       ____ _(_) /_/ __(_) /_(_)\n      / __ `/ / __/ /_/ / __/ /\n     / /_/ / / /_/ __/ / /_/ /\n     \\__, /_/\\__/_/ /_/\\__/_/\n    /____/\n\n    Enter GitHub URL (leave blank to use https://github.com/):\n```\n\nFor Python 2, use `python2`.\n\n```console\n    $ python2 ./gitfiti.py\n\n              _ __  _____ __  _\n       ____ _(_) /_/ __(_) /_(_)\n      / __ `/ / __/ /_/ / __/ /\n     / /_/ / / /_/ __/ / /_/ /\n     \\__, /_/\\__/_/ /_/\\__/_/\n    /____/\n\n    Enter GitHub URL (leave blank to use https://github.com/):\n```\n\n3. Run the generated `gitfiti.sh` or `gitfiti.ps1` from your home directory (or any non-git tracked dir) and watch it go to work.\n4. Wait... Seriously, you'll probably need to wait a day or two for the gitfiti to show in your commit graph.\n\n### User Templates\n\nThe file format for personal templates is the following:\n\n1. Each template starts off with a \":\" and then a name (eg. \":foo\")\n2. Each line after that is part of a json-recognizable array.\n3. The array contain values 0-4, 0 being blank and 4 being dark green.\n4. To add multiple templates, just add another name tag as described in 1.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n:center-blank\n[[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],\n[1,1,1,0,1,1,1],\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]\n```\n\nThis would output a 7 x 7 light green square with a single blank center square.\n\nOnce you have a file with templates, enter its name when prompted and the templates will be added to the list of options.\n\n### Removal\n\nFortunately if you regret your gitfiti in the morning, removing it is fairly easy: delete the repo you created for your gitfiti (and wait).\n\n### License\n\ngitfiti is released under [The MIT license (MIT)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n---\n\n#### Todo\n\n- ~~Remove 'requests' dependency~~ [_thanks empathetic-alligator_](https://github.com/empathetic-alligator)\n- ~~Web interface~~ See several web-based things below\n- ~~Load \"art\" from a file~~ [_thanks empathetic-alligator_](https://github.com/empathetic-alligator)\n- Load commit content from a file\n- Text/alphabet option\n- ~~powershell support!~~ [_thanks axzn_](https://github.com/axzn)\n- ...\n- Profit?\n\n#### Notable derivatives or mentions\n\n- [Vincent Van Git](https://github.com/jh3y/vincent-van-git) Vincent, which offers a [very slick web ui](https://vincent-van-git.netlify.app/) to generate a gitfiti script\n- [github-calendar-customerizer](https://github.com/ZachSaucier/github-calendar-customizer) from ZachSaucier, another very [nice web GUI](https://codepen.io/ZachSaucier/full/PzVRBy) for generating gitfiti templates\n- [git-art](https://github.com/jamesjarvis/git-art) from jamesjarvis, a work-alike web based [editor GUI](https://jamesjarvis.github.io/git-art/) that generates the script too\n- [Pikesley's](https://github.com/pikesley) Pokrovsky, which offers Github History Vandalism [as a Service!](http://pokrovsky.herokuapp.com/)\n- [PSVandalism](https://github.com/DenisBalan/PSVandalism) Wrapper around Pokrovsky, which makes possible vandalising Github History from Powershell\n- [github-board](https://github.com/bayandin/github-board) commits gitfiti from easy templates\n- [ghdecoy](https://github.com/tickelton/ghdecoy) fills the contribution graph with random data (sneaky!)\n- [Gitfiti Painter](http://codepen.io/cbas/pen/vOXeKV) visual drawing tool for artists to easily create templates\n- [git-draw](https://github.com/ben174/git-draw) a Chrome extension which will allow you to freely draw on your commit map(!)\n- [github-jack](https://github.com/tardypad/github-jack) a pure bash version with space invaders and shining creepypasta\n- [github-graffiti](https://github.com/mavrk/github-graffiti) a GUI editor with a bash script to allow custom designs on your commit map\n- [Paint GitHub](https://paintgithub.com/) is the most convenient way to paint your GitHub contribution graph!\n- [contribution-pixel-messages](https://github.com/abulvenz/contribution-pixel-messages) generates a date plan from an editable GUI\n- Seen something else?
