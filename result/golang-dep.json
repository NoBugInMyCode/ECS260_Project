It requires Go 1.9 or newer to compile.\n\n**NOTE:** Dep was an official experiment to implement a package manager for Go.\nAs of 2020, Dep is deprecated and archived in favor of Go modules, which have\nhad official support since Go 1.11. For more details, see https://golang.org/ref/mod.\n\nFor guides and reference materials about `dep`, see [the documentation](https://golang.github.io/dep).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou should use an officially released version. Release binaries are available on\nthe [releases](https://github.com/golang/dep/releases) page.\n\nOn MacOS you can install or upgrade to the latest released version with Homebrew:\n\n```sh\n$ brew install dep\n$ brew upgrade dep\n```\n\nOn Debian platforms you can install or upgrade to the latest version with apt-get:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo apt-get install go-dep\n```\n\nOn Windows, you can download a tarball from\n[go.equinox.io](https://go.equinox.io/github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep).\n\nOn other platforms you can use the `install.sh` script:\n\n```sh\n$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nIt will install into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory by default or any other directory you specify using the `INSTALL_DIRECTORY` environment variable.\n\nIf your platform is not supported, you'll need to build it manually or let the team know and we'll consider adding your platform\nto the release builds.\n\nIf you're interested in getting the source code, or hacking on `dep`, you can\ninstall via `go get`:\n\n```sh\ngo get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep\n```\n",
