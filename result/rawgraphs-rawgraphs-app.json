Based on the [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg) format, visualizations can be easily edited with vector graphics applications for further refinements or directly embedded into web pages.\n\nKnowing the need to work with sensitive information, the data injected into RAWGraphs is processed only by the web browser: **no server-side operations or storages are performed**. No one will see, touch or copy your data!\n\nRAWGraphs is also highly customizable and extensible, accepting new custom layouts defined by users. For more information about adding or editing layouts, see the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw/wiki/Developer-Guide).\n\n- App page: [app.rawgraphs.io](http://app.rawgraphs.io)\n- Project official page: [rawgraphs.io](http://rawgraphs.io)\n- Google group: [groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/densitydesign-raw](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/densitydesign-raw)\n\n## Usage\n\nThe easiest way to use RAWGraphs is by accessing the most updated version on the **[official app page](http://app.rawgraphs.io)**. However, RAWGraphs can also run locally on your machine: see the installation instructions below for know-how.\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you want to run your instance of RAWGraphs locally on your machine, be sure you have the following requirements installed. The following guide is for intermediate users (you will have to open your console and type some commands, it's better if you know what you are doing).\n\n### Requirements\n\nIf you want to run your instance of RAWGraphs locally on your machine, be sure you have the following requirements installed.\n\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (it could be used through the interface of [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/))\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\n\n### Instructions (macOS)\n\nIn the terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to install the app and clone the `RAWGraphs-app` GitHub repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app.git\n```\n\nBrowse the folder containing the repository:\n\n```shell\ncd rawgraphs-app\n```\n\nInstall the needed dependencies through Yarn:\n\n```shell\nyarn install\n```\n\nNow you can run the project locally in development mode with the command:\n\n```shell\nyarn start\n```\n\nYou can also build your own version and upload it on your server by running the command:\n\n```shell\nyarn build\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWant to contribute to RAWGraphs's development? You are more than welcome! Start by forking the repository (the \"Fork\" button at the top-right corner of this page) and follow the instructions above to clone it and install dependencies. Then you can use Github's issues and pull requests to discuss and share your work.\nYou will need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) before submitting. We adopted CLA to be sure that the project will remain open source.
