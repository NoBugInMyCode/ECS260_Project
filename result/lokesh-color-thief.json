Uses Chai.\n+ `index.html` - Example page.\n\n\n### Running tests\n\nThere are two sets of tests:\n\n1. Browser tests run with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io)\n2. Node tests run with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)\n\nTo run both the browser and Node tests:\n\n- `npm run dev` to start local server.\n- `npm run test` then run tests in a separate process\n\nTo run just the browser tests with the Cypress UI:\n\n- `npm run dev` to start local server\n- `npm run test:browser`\nor\n- `npm run cypress` to view the Cypress UI\n\nTo run just the Node tests:\n\n- `npm run test:node`\n\n\n### Adding tests\n\n- Update `cypress/test-pages/index.html` as needed or create a new test page if you need new examples.\n- Add new tests in `cypress/integration/apis_spec.js`\n\n### Making a new release\n\n- Merge `dev` into `master`\n- Pull down `master`\n- Update version number in `src/color-thief.js` and `package.json`\n- Delete `package-lock.json` and then install deps\n- Run `npm run build`\n- Confirm tests pass `npm run dev` and `npm run test`\n- Commit and push built files back up to `master`\n- Create a new Github release along with tag. Naming convention for both ```v2.8.1```\n- `npm publish`",
