The fork\nwas created because the majority of the maintainers at the time did not find\nthe new proposed features privacy respecting enough. The most significant issue is with\nengine metrics.\n\nSearx is built for privacy conscious users. It comes with a unique set of\nchallenges. One of the problems we face is that users rather not report bugs,\nbecause they do not want to publicly share what engines they use or what search\nquery triggered a problem. It is a challenge we accepted.\n\nThe new metrics feature collects more information to make engine maintenance easier.\nWe could have had better and more error reports to benefit searx maintainers.\nHowever, we believe that the users of searx must come first, not the\nsoftware. We are willing to compromise on the lack of issue reports to avoid\nviolating the privacy of users.\n\nFurthermore, SearxNG is under heavy refactoring and dependencies are constantly updated, even\nif it is unnecessary. It increases the risk of introducing regressions. In searx\nwe strive for stability, rather than moving fast and breaking things.\n\nIs searx for me?\n################\n\nAre you privacy conscious user? Then yes.\n\nIn searx we decided to double down on being privacy respecting. We are picking\nengine changes from SearxNG, but we are not implementing engine detailed\nmonitoring and not adding a new UI that relies on Javascript.\n\nIf you are willing to give up some privacy respecting features, we encourage you to\nadopt SearxNG. Searx is targeted for privacy conscious users who run their\ninstances locally, instead of using public instances.\n\nWhy should I use SearxNG?\n#########################\n\nSearxNG has rolling releases, dependencies updated more frequently, and engines are fixed\nfaster. It is easy to set up your own public instance, and monitor its\nperformance and metrics. It is simple to maintain as an instance administrator.\n\nAs a user, it provides a prettier user interface and nicer experience.\n",
