Automate the [effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect).**\n\nThe Internet can be a little unfair. It's way too easy for ISPs, telecoms, politicians, and corporations to block access to the sites and information that you care about. But breaking through these restrictions is *tough*. Or is it?\n\nIf you have an account with a cloud computing provider, Streisand can set up a new node with many censorship-resistant VPN services nearly automatically. You'll need a little experience with a Unix command-line. (But without Streisand, it could take days for a skilled Unix administrator to configure these services securely!) At the end, you'll have a private website with software and instructions.\n\nHere's what **[a sample Streisand server](http://streisandeffect-demo.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/)** looks like.\n\n\nThere's a [list of supported cloud providers](#cloud-providers); experts may be able to use Streisand to install on many other cloud providers.\n\n## VPN services\n\nOne type of tool that people use to avoid network censorship is a Virtual Private Network (VPN). There are many kinds of VPNs.\n\nNot all network censorship is alike; in some places, it changes from day to day. Streisand provides many different VPN services to try. (You don't have to install them all, though.)\n\nSome Streisand services include add-ons for further censorship and throttling resistance:\n\n* [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)\n    * [Tinyproxy](https://banu.com/tinyproxy/) may be used as an HTTP proxy.\n* [OpenConnect](https://ocserv.gitlab.io/www/index.html) / [Cisco AnyConnect](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client/index.html)\n    * This protocol is widely used by multi-national corporations, and might not be blocked.\n* [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html)\n    * [Stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/index.html) add-on available.\n* [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html), \n    * The [V2ray-plugin](https://github.com/shadowsocks/v2ray-plugin) is installed to provide robust traffic evasion on hostile networks (especially those implementing quality of service (QOS) throttling).\n* A private [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) bridge relay\n    * [Obfsproxy](https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en) with obfs4 available as an add-on.\n* [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), a modern high-performance protocol.\n\nSee also:\n* A [more technical list of features](Features.md) \n* A [more technical list of services](Services.md)\n\n<a id=\"cloud-providers\"></a>\n## Cloud providers\n* Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n* Microsoft Azure\n* Digital Ocean\n* Google Compute Engine (GCE)\n* Linode\n* Rackspace\n\n\n#### Other providers\nWe recommend using one of the above providers. If you are an expert and can set up a *fresh Ubuntu 16.04 server* elsewhere, there are \"localhost\" and \"existing remote server\" installation methods. For more information, see [the advanced installation instructions](Advanced%20installation.md).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou need command-line access to a Unix system. You can use Linux, BSD, or macOS; on Windows 10, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) counts as Linux. \n\nOnce you're ready, see the [full installation instructions](Installation.md).\n\n\n## Things we want to do better\n\nAside from a good deal of cleanup, we could really use:\n\n* Easier setup.\n* Faster adoption of new censorship-avoidance tools\n\nWe're looking for help with both.\n\nIf there is something that you think Streisand should do, or if you find a bug in its documentation or execution, please file a report on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand/issues).\n\nCore Contributors\n----------------\n* Jay Carlson (@nopdotcom)\n* Nick Clarke (@nickolasclarke)\n* Joshua Lund (@jlund)\n* Ali Makki (@alimakki)\n* Daniel McCarney (@cpu)\n* Corban Raun (@CorbanR)\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n[Jason A. Donenfeld](https://www.zx2c4.com/) deserves a lot of credit for being brave enough to reimagine what a modern VPN should look like and for coming up with something as good as [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/). He has our sincere thanks for all of his patient help and high-quality feedback.\n\nWe are grateful to [Trevor Smith](https://github.com/trevorsmith) for his massive contributions. He suggested the Gateway approach, provided tons of invaluable feedback, made *everything* look better, and developed the HTML template that served as the inspiration to take things to the next level before Streisand's public release.\n\nHuge thanks to [Paul Wouters](https://nohats.ca/) of [The Libreswan Project](https://libreswan.org/) for his generous help troubleshooting the L2TP/IPsec setup.\n\n[Starcadian's](https://www.starcadian.com/) 'Sunset Blood' album was played on repeat approximately 300 times during the first few months of work on the project in early 2014.\n",
