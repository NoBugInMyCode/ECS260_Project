        "readme": "# Command & Conquer Remastered Collection\n\nThis repository includes source code for TiberianDawn.dll, RedAlert.dll and the Map Editor for the Command & Conquer Remastered Collection. This release provides support to the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=1213210) for the C&C Remaster Collection.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe following dependencies must be installed to successfully build the solution;\n\n- Windows 8.1 SDK\n- MFC for Visual Studio C++ \n\n\n## Compiling (Win32 Only)\n\nTo use the compiled binaries, you must own the game. The C&C Remastered Collection is available for purchase on [EA App](https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-remastered/buy/pc) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1213210/Command__Conquer_Remastered_Collection/).\n\nThe quickest way to build all configurations in the project is open [CnCRemastered.sln](CnCRemastered.sln) in Microsoft Visual Studio (we recommend using 2017 as later versions report an error due to a packing mismatch with the Windows SDK headers) and select \u201cBuild\u201d from the toolbar, then select \u201cBatch Build\u201d. Click the \"Select All\" button, then click the \"Rebuild\" button.\n\nWhen the solution has finished building, the compiled binaries can be found in the newly created `bin` folder in the root of the repository.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis repository will not be accepting any contributions (pull requests, issues, etc). If you wish to create changes to the source code and encourage collaboration, please create a fork of the repository under your GitHub user/organization space.\n\n\n## Support\n\nThis repository is for preservation purposes only and is archived without support. \n\n\n## License\n\nThis repository and its contents are licensed under the GPL v3 license, with additional terms applied. Please see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details. \n",
