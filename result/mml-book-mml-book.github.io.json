To be published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nWe are in the process of writing a book on Mathematics for Machine Learning that motivates people to learn mathematical concepts. The book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read those other books.\n\nWe split the book into two parts:\n\n* Mathematical foundations\n* Example machine learning algorithms that use the mathematical foundations\n\nWe aim to keep this book reasonably short, so we cannot cover everything. We will also provide exercises for part 1 and jupyter notebooks for part 2 of the book.\n\nThe notebooks can be run live on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/master?filepath=tutorials).\n\nAlternatively try them directly on **Google Colab** \n\n| Title | Tutorial Notebook  | Solution |\n|-|:-:|:-:|\n| Linear Regression  | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial_linear_regression.ipynb) | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial_linear_regression.solution.ipynb) |\n|  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial_pca.ipynb) | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial_pca.solution.ipynb) |\n| Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial_gmm.ipynb) | [ ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial_gmm.solution.ipynb)|",
