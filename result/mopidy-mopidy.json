        "readme": "******\nMopidy\n******\n\n`Mopidy`_ is an extensible music server written in Python.\n\nMopidy plays music from local disk, Spotify, SoundCloud, Google Play Music, and\nmore. You edit the playlist from any phone, tablet, or computer using a variety\nof MPD and web clients.\n\n**Stream music from the cloud**\n\nVanilla Mopidy only plays music from files and radio streams.  Through\n`extensions`_, Mopidy can play music from cloud services like Spotify,\nSoundCloud, and Google Play Music.\nWith Mopidy's extension support, backends for new music sources can be easily\nadded.\n\n**Mopidy is just a server**\n\nMopidy is a Python application that runs in a terminal or in the background on\nLinux computers or Macs that have network connectivity and audio output.\nOut of the box, Mopidy is an HTTP server. If you install the `Mopidy-MPD`_\nextension, it becomes an MPD server too. Many additional frontends for\ncontrolling Mopidy are available as extensions.\n\n**Pick your favorite client**\n\nYou and the people around you can all connect their favorite MPD or web client\nto the Mopidy server to search for music and manage the playlist together.\nWith a browser or MPD client, which is available for all popular operating\nsystems, you can control the music from any phone, tablet, or computer.\n\n**Mopidy on Raspberry Pi**\n\nThe `Raspberry Pi`_ is a popular device to run Mopidy on, either using\nRaspbian, Ubuntu, or Arch Linux.\nPimoroni recommends Mopidy for use with their `Pirate Audio`_ audio gear for\nRaspberry Pi.\nMopidy is also a significant building block in the `Pi Musicbox`_ integrated\naudio jukebox system for Raspberry Pi.\n\n**Mopidy is hackable**\n\nMopidy's extension support and Python, JSON-RPC, and JavaScript APIs make\nMopidy a perfect base for your projects.\nIn one hack, a Raspberry Pi was embedded in an old cassette player. The buttons\nand volume control are wired up with GPIO on the Raspberry Pi, and are used to\ncontrol playback through a custom Mopidy extension. The cassettes have NFC tags\nused to select playlists from Spotify.\n\n.. _Mopidy: https://mopidy.com/\n.. _extensions: https://mopidy.com/ext/\n.. _Mopidy-MPD: https://mopidy.com/ext/mpd/\n.. _Raspberry Pi: https://www.raspberrypi.org/\n.. _Pirate Audio: https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pirate-audio\n.. _Pi Musicbox: https://www.pimusicbox.com/\n\n\n**Getting started**\n\nTo get started with Mopidy, begin by reading the\n`installation docs <https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/>`_.\n\n\n**Contributing**\n\nBegin by reading the\n`contributing <https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/contributing/>`_\nsection of our documentation.\nIf you are a developer, please also read\n`Development environment <https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/devenv/>`_\nand/or\n`Extension development <https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/extensiondev/>`_.\nWe welcome all kinds of help with bug fixing, testing, documentation, and supporting other users.\n\n\n**Project resources**\n\n- `Documentation <https://docs.mopidy.com/>`_\n- `Discourse forum <https://discourse.mopidy.com/>`_\n- `Zulip chat <https://mopidy.zulipchat.com/>`_\n- `Source code <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy>`_\n- `Issue tracker <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy/issues>`_\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mopidy\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/mopidy/\n    :alt: Latest PyPI version\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/mopidy/mopidy/ci.yml\n    :target: https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy/actions/workflows/ci.yml\n    :alt: CI build status\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/mopidy\n    :target: https://docs.mopidy.com/\n    :alt: Read the Docs build status\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/mopidy/mopidy\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/mopidy/mopidy\n    :alt: Test coverage\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20zulip-brightgreen\n    :target: https://mopidy.zulipchat.com/\n    :alt: Chat on Zulip\n",
