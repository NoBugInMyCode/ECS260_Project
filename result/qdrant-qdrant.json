It makes it useful for all sorts of neural-network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.\n\nQdrant is written in Rust \ud83e\udd80, which makes it fast and reliable even under high load. See [benchmarks](https://qdrant.tech/benchmarks/).\n\nWith Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more!\n\nQdrant is also available as a fully managed **[Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io/)** \u26c5 including a **free tier**.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong><a href=\"docs/QUICK_START.md\">Quick Start</a> \u2022 <a href=\"#clients\">Client Libraries</a> \u2022 <a href=\"#demo-projects\">Demo Projects</a> \u2022 <a href=\"#integrations\">Integrations</a> \u2022 <a href=\"#contacts\">Contact</a>\n\n</strong>\n</p>\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Python\n\n```\npip install qdrant-client\n```\n\nThe python client offers a convenient way to start with Qdrant locally:\n\n```python\nfrom qdrant_client import QdrantClient\nqdrant = QdrantClient(\":memory:\") # Create in-memory Qdrant instance, for testing, CI/CD\n# OR\nclient = QdrantClient(path=\"path/to/db\")  # Persists changes to disk, fast prototyping\n```\n\n### Client-Server\n\nTo experience the full power of Qdrant locally, run the container with this command:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant\n```\n\nNow you can connect to this with any client, including Python:\n\n```python\nqdrant = QdrantClient(\"http://localhost:6333\") # Connect to existing Qdrant instance\n```\n\nBefore deploying Qdrant to production, be sure to read our [installation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/installation/) and [security](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/security/) guides.\n\n### Clients\n\nQdrant offers the following client libraries to help you integrate it into your application stack with ease:\n\n- Official:\n  - [Go client](https://github.com/qdrant/go-client)\n  - [Rust client](https://github.com/qdrant/rust-client)\n  - [JavaScript/TypeScript client](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-js)\n  - [Python client](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-client)\n  - [.NET/C# client](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-dotnet)\n  - [Java client](https://github.com/qdrant/java-client)\n- Community:\n  - [Elixir](https://hexdocs.pm/qdrant/readme.html)\n  - [PHP](https://github.com/hkulekci/qdrant-php)\n  - [Ruby](https://github.com/andreibondarev/qdrant-ruby)\n  - [Java](https://github.com/metaloom/qdrant-java-client)\n\n### Where do I go from here?\n\n- [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICK_START.md)\n- End to End [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Bz8RSVHwnNDaNtDwotfPj0w7AYzsdXZ-?usp=sharing) demo with SentenceBERT and Qdrant\n- Detailed [Documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) are great starting points\n- [Step-by-Step Tutorial](https://qdrant.to/qdrant-tutorial) to create your first neural network project with Qdrant\n\n## Demo Projects  <a href=\"https://replit.com/@qdrant\"><img align=\"right\" src=\"https://replit.com/badge/github/qdrant/qdrant\" alt=\"Run on Repl.it\"></a>\n\n### Discover Semantic Text Search \ud83d\udd0d\n\nUnlock the power of semantic embeddings with Qdrant, transcending keyword-based search to find meaningful connections in short texts.

You can find gRPC documentation [here](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/interfaces/#grpc-interface).\n\n## Features\n\n### Filtering and Payload\n\nQdrant can attach any JSON payloads to vectors, allowing for both the storage and filtering of data based on the values in these payloads.\nPayload supports a wide range of data types and query conditions, including keyword matching, full-text filtering, numerical ranges, geo-locations, and more.\n\nFiltering conditions can be combined in various ways, including `should`, `must`, and `must_not` clauses,\nensuring that you can implement any desired business logic on top of similarity matching.\n\n\n### Hybrid Search with Sparse Vectors\n\nTo address the limitations of vector embeddings when searching for specific keywords, Qdrant introduces support for sparse vectors in addition to the regular dense ones.\n\nSparse vectors can be viewed as an generalization of BM25 or TF-IDF ranking. They enable you to harness the capabilities of transformer-based neural networks to weigh individual tokens effectively.\n\n\n### Vector Quantization and On-Disk Storage\n\nQdrant provides multiple options to make vector search cheaper and more resource-efficient.\nBuilt-in vector quantization reduces RAM usage by up to 97% and dynamically manages the trade-off between search speed and precision.\n\n\n### Distributed Deployment\n\nQdrant offers comprehensive horizontal scaling support through two key mechanisms:\n1. Size expansion via sharding and throughput enhancement via replication\n2. Zero-downtime rolling updates and seamless dynamic scaling of the collections\n\n\n### Highlighted Features\n\n* **Query Planning and Payload Indexes** - leverages stored payload information to optimize query execution strategy.\n* **SIMD Hardware Acceleration** - utilizes modern CPU x86-x64 and Neon architectures to deliver better performance.\n* **Async I/O** - uses `io_uring` to maximize disk throughput utilization even on a network-attached storage.\n* **Write-Ahead Logging** - ensures data persistence with update confirmation, even during power outages.\n\n\n# Integrations\n\nExamples and/or documentation of Qdrant integrations:\n\n- [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/qdrant-and-cohere) ([blogpost on building a QA app with Cohere and Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/articles/qa-with-cohere-and-qdrant/)) - Use Cohere embeddings with Qdrant\n- [DocArray](https://docs.docarray.org/user_guide/storing/index_qdrant/) - Use Qdrant as a document store in DocArray\n- [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations/qdrant-document-store) - Use Qdrant as a document store with Haystack ([blogpost](https://haystack.deepset.ai/blog/qdrant-integration)).\n- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/qdrant/) ([blogpost](https://qdrant.tech/articles/langchain-integration/)) - Use Qdrant as a memory backend for LangChain.\n- [LlamaIndex](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/QdrantIndexDemo.html) - Use Qdrant as a Vector Store with LlamaIndex.\n- [OpenAI - ChatGPT retrieval plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/blob/main/docs/providers/qdrant/setup.md) - Use Qdrant as a memory backend for ChatGPT\n- [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/the-power-of-persistent-memory-with-semantic-kernel-and-qdrant-vector-database/) - Use Qdrant as persistent memory with Semantic Kernel\n\n## Contacts\n\n- Have questions?
