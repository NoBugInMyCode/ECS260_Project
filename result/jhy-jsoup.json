It offers an easy-to-use API for URL fetching, data parsing, extraction, and manipulation using DOM API methods, CSS, and xpath selectors.\n\n**jsoup** implements the [WHATWG HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) specification, and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers.\n\n* scrape and [parse](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/input/parse-document-from-string) HTML from a URL, file, or string\n* find and [extract data](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/extracting-data/selector-syntax), using DOM traversal or CSS selectors\n* manipulate the [HTML elements](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/modifying-data/set-html), attributes, and text\n* [clean](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer) user-submitted content against a safe-list, to prevent XSS attacks\n* output tidy HTML\n\njsoup is designed to deal with all varieties of HTML found in the wild; from pristine and validating, to invalid tag-soup; jsoup will create a sensible parse tree.\n\nSee [**jsoup.org**](https://jsoup.org/) for downloads and the full [API documentation](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/).\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)\n\n## Example\nFetch the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) homepage, parse it to a [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction), and select the headlines from the *In the News* section into a list of [Elements](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/select/Elements.html):\n\n```java\nDocument doc = Jsoup.connect(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/\").get();\nlog(doc.title());\nElements newsHeadlines = doc.select(\"#mp-itn b a\");\nfor (Element headline : newsHeadlines) {\n  log(\"%s\\n\\t%s\", \n    headline.attr(\"title\"), headline.absUrl(\"href\"));\n}\n```\n[Online sample](https://try.jsoup.org/~LGB7rk_atM2roavV0d-czMt3J_g), [full source](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jsoup/examples/Wikipedia.java).\n\n## Open source\njsoup is an open source project distributed under the liberal [MIT license](https://jsoup.org/license). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup).\n\n## Getting started\n1. [Download](https://jsoup.org/download) the latest jsoup jar (or add it to your Maven/Gradle build)\n2. Read the [cookbook](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/)\n3. Enjoy!\n\n### Android support\nWhen used in Android projects, [core library desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring) with the [NIO specification](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java11-nio-support-table) should be enabled to support Java 8+ features.\n\n## Development and support\nIf you have any questions on how to use jsoup, or have ideas for future development, please get in touch via [jsoup Discussions](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/discussions).\n\nIf you find any issues, please file a [bug](https://jsoup.org/bugs) after checking for duplicates.\n\nThe [colophon](https://jsoup.org/colophon) talks about the history of and tools used to build jsoup.\n\n## Status\njsoup is in general, stable release.\n",
