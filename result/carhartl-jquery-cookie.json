        "readme": "# IMPORTANT!\n\nThis project was moved to https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie, check [the discussion](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/issues/349).\n\nNew issues should be opened at https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie/issues\n\n# jquery.cookie [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carhartl/jquery-cookie.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carhartl/jquery-cookie) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/carhartl/jquery-cookie.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/carhartl/jquery-cookie)\n\nA simple, lightweight jQuery plugin for reading, writing and deleting cookies.\n\n**If you're viewing this, you're reading the documentation for the old repository.\n[View documentation for the latest backwards compatible release (1.5.1).](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie/tree/v1.5.1)**\n\n## Build Status Matrix\n\n[![Selenium Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/jquery-cookie.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/jquery-cookie)\n\n## Installation\n\nInclude script *after* the jQuery library (unless you are packaging scripts somehow else):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/path/to/jquery.cookie.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**Do not include the script directly from GitHub (http://raw.github.com/...).** The file is being served as text/plain and as such being blocked\nin Internet Explorer on Windows 7 for instance (because of the wrong MIME type). Bottom line: GitHub is not a CDN.\n\nThe plugin can also be loaded as AMD or CommonJS module.\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate session cookie:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie('name', 'value');\n```\n\nCreate expiring cookie, 7 days from then:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie('name', 'value', { expires: 7 });\n```\n\nCreate expiring cookie, valid across entire site:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie('name', 'value', { expires: 7, path: '/' });\n```\n\nRead cookie:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie('name'); // => \"value\"\n$.cookie('nothing'); // => undefined\n```\n\nRead all available cookies:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie(); // => { \"name\": \"value\" }\n```\n\nDelete cookie:\n\n```javascript\n// Returns true when cookie was successfully deleted, otherwise false\n$.removeCookie('name'); // => true\n$.removeCookie('nothing'); // => false\n\n// Need to use the same attributes (path, domain) as what the cookie was written with\n$.cookie('name', 'value', { path: '/' });\n// This won't work!\n$.removeCookie('name'); // => false\n// This will work!\n$.removeCookie('name', { path: '/' }); // => true\n```\n\n*Note: when deleting a cookie, you must pass the exact same path, domain and secure options that were used to set the cookie, unless you're relying on the default options that is.*\n\n## Configuration\n\n### raw\n\nBy default the cookie value is encoded/decoded when writing/reading, using `encodeURIComponent`/`decodeURIComponent`. Bypass this by setting raw to true:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie.raw = true;\n```\n\n### json\n\nTurn on automatic storage of JSON objects passed as the cookie value. Assumes `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie.json = true;\n```\n\n## Cookie Options\n\nCookie attributes can be set globally by setting properties of the `$.cookie.defaults` object or individually for each call to `$.cookie()` by passing a plain object to the options argument. Per-call options override the default options.\n\n### expires\n\n    expires: 365\n\nDefine lifetime of the cookie. Value can be a `Number` which will be interpreted as days from time of creation or a `Date` object. If omitted, the cookie becomes a session cookie.\n\n### path\n\n    path: '/'\n\nDefine the path where the cookie is valid. *By default the path of the cookie is the path of the page where the cookie was created (standard browser behavior).* If you want to make it available for instance across the entire domain use `path: '/'`. Default: path of page where the cookie was created.\n\n**Note regarding Internet Explorer:**\n\n> Due to an obscure bug in the underlying WinINET InternetGetCookie implementation, IE\u2019s document.cookie will not return a cookie if it was set with a path attribute containing a filename.\n\n(From [Internet Explorer Cookie Internals (FAQ)](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2009/08/20/wininet-ie-cookie-internals-faq.aspx))\n\nThis means one cannot set a path using `path: window.location.pathname` in case such pathname contains a filename like so: `/check.html` (or at least, such cookie cannot be read correctly).\n\n### domain\n\n    domain: 'example.com'\n\nDefine the domain where the cookie is valid. Default: domain of page where the cookie was created.\n\n### secure\n\n    secure: true\n\nIf true, the cookie transmission requires a secure protocol (https). Default: `false`.\n\n## Converters\n\nProvide a conversion function as optional last argument for reading, in order to change the cookie's value\nto a different representation on the fly.\n\nExample for parsing a value into a number:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie('foo', '42');\n$.cookie('foo', Number); // => 42\n```\n\nDealing with cookies that have been encoded using `escape` (3rd party cookies):\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie.raw = true;\n$.cookie('foo', unescape);\n```\n\nYou can pass an arbitrary conversion function.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck out the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Authors\n\n[Klaus Hartl](https://github.com/carhartl)\n",
