It does NOT require root privileges.\n\nIt supports three major platforms: GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS.\n\nIt focuses on:\n\n - **lightness** (displays only the device screen)\n - **performance** (30~60 fps)\n - **quality** (1920\u00d71080 or above)\n - **low latency** ([35~70ms][lowlatency])\n - **low startup time** (only about 1 second to display the first frame)\n - **non-intrusiveness** (nothing will be installed on the device)\n\n[lowlatency]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/pull/646\n\n![win](screenshot/win-en.png)\n\n![mac](screenshot/mac-en.png)\n\n![linux](screenshot/linux-en.png)\n\n## Mapping Keys\nYou can write your script to map keyboard and mouse actions to touches and clicks of the mobile phone according to your needs. [Here](docs/KeyMapDes.md) are the script writing rules.\n\nScript for TikTok and some other games are provided by default. Once enabled, you can play the game with your keyboard and mouse. The default key mapping for PUBG Mobile is as follows:\n\n![game](screenshot/game.jpg)\n\n[Here is a video demonstration playing PUBG Mobile.](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/video?__biz=MzU1NTg5MjYyNw==&mid=100000015&sn=3e301fdc5a364bd16d6207fa674bc8b3&vid=wxv_968792362971430913)\n\nInstruction for adding new customized mapping files.\n\n- Write a customized script and put it in the `keymap` directory\n- Click `refresh script` to show it\n- Select your script\n- Connect to your phone, start service and click `apply`\n- Press `~` key (the SwitchKey in the key map script) to switch to custom mapping mode\n- Press the ~ key again to switch back to normal mode\n- (For games such as PUBG Mobile) If you want to move vehicles with the STEER_WHEEL keys, you need to set the move mode to `single rocker mode`.\n\n## Group control\nYou can control all your phones at the same time.\n\n![group-control-demo](docs/image/group-control.gif)\n\n## Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=barry-ran/QtScrcpy&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#barry-ran/QtScrcpy&Date)\n\n## Thanks\n\nQtScrcpy is based on [Genymobile](https://github.com/Genymobile)'s [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) project. Thanks a lot!\n\nThe difference between QtScrcpy and the original scrcpy is as follows:\n\nkey points|scrcpy|QtScrcpy\n--|:--:|:--:\nui|sdl|qt\nvideo encode|ffmpeg|ffmpeg\nvideo render|sdl|opengl\ncross-platform|self implemented|provided by Qt\nlanguage|C|C++\nstyle|sync|async\nkeymap|no custom keymap|support custom keymap\nbuild|meson+gradle|qmake or CMake\n\n- It's very easy to customize your GUI with Qt\n- Asynchronous programming of Qt-based signal slot mechanism improves performance\n- Easy to learn\n- Add support for multi-touch\n\n\n## Learn\n\nIf you are interested in it and want to learn how it works but do not know how to get started, you can choose to purchase my recorded video lessons.\nIt details the development architecture and the development process of the entire software and helps you develop QtScrcpy from scratch.\n\nCourse introduction\uff1a[https://blog.csdn.net/rankun1/article/details/87970523](https://blog.csdn.net/rankun1/article/details/87970523)\n\nYou can join my QQ group for QtScrcpy and exchange ideas with like-minded friends.\uff1a\n\nQQ Group number\uff1a901736468\n\n\n## Requirements\nAndroid API >= 21 (Android 5.0).\n\nMake sure you have enabled [ADB debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).\n\n[enable-adb]: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling\n\n\n## Download\n\n[gitee-download]: https://gitee.com/Barryda/QtScrcpy/releases\n[github-download]: https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy/releases\n\n### Windows\nOn Windows, for simplicity, prebuilt archives with all the dependencies (including ADB) are available at Releases:\n\n - [`QtScrcpy`][github-download]\n\nor you can [build it yourself](#Build)\n\n### Mac OS\nOn Mac OS, for simplicity, prebuilt archives with all the dependencies (including ADB) are available at Releases:\n\n- [`QtScrcpy`][github-download]\n\nor you can [build it yourself](#Build)\n\n### Linux\nFor Arch Linux Users, you can use AUR to install: `yay -Syu qtscrcpy` (may be outdated; maintainer: [yochananmarqos](https://aur.archlinux.org/account/yochananmarqos))\n\nFor users in other distros, you can use the prebuilt archives from Releases:\n\n- [`QtScrcpy`][github-download]\n\nor you can get it at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy/actions/workflows/ubuntu.yml), in branch `dev` and download the latest artifact.\n\nor you can [build it yourself](#Build) (not recommended, get it in Actions if you can)\n\n## Run\nConnect to your Android device on your computer, then run the program and click `USB connect` or `WiFi connect`\n\n### Wireless connection steps (ensure that the mobile phone and PC are on the same LAN):\n1.

Please open PRs to the dev branch instead of the master branch\n2. Please rebase the original project before opening PRs\n3. Please submit PRs on the principle of \"small amounts, many times\" (one PR for a change is recommended)\n4. Please keep the code style consistent with the existing style.\n\n## Why develop QtScrcpy?\nThere are several reasons listed below according to importance (high to low).\n1. In the process of learning Qt, I need a real project to try.\n2. I have some background skills in audio and video and I am interested in them.\n3. I have some Android development skills. But I have used it for a long time. I want to consolidate it.\n4. I found scrcpy and decided to re-make it with the new technology stack (C++ + Qt + Opengl + FFmpeg).\n\n\n## Build\nAll the dependencies are provided and it is easy to compile.\n\n### QtScrcpy\n#### Non-Arch Linux Users\n1. Set up the Qt development environment with the official Qt installer or third-party tools such as [aqt](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall) on the target platform.\n   Qt version bigger than 5.12 is required. (use MSVC 2019 on Windows)\n2. Clone the project with `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:barry-ran/QtScrcpy.git`\n3. For Windows, open CMakeLists.txt with QtCreator and compile Release\n4. For Linux, directly run `./ci/linux/build_for_linux.sh \"Release\"`\nNote: compiled artifacts are located at `output/x64/Release`\n\n#### Arch Linux Users\n1. Install packages: `base-devel cmake qt5-base qt5-multimedia qt5-x11extras` (`qtcreator` is recommended)\n2. Clone the project with `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:barry-ran/QtScrcpy.git`\n3. Run `./ci/linux/build_for_linux.sh \"Release\"`\n\n### Scrcpy-Server\n1. Set up Android development environment on the target platform\n2. Open server project in project root with Android Studio\n3. The first time you open it, if you do not have the corresponding version of Gradle, you will be prompted to find Gradle, whether to upgrade Gradle or create it. Select Cancel. After cancelling, you will be prompted to select the location of existing Gradle. Cancel it too and it will download automatically.\n4. After compiling the apk, rename it to scrcpy-server and replace QtScrcpy/QtScrcpyCore/src/third_party/scrcpy-server.\n\n## Licence\nSince it is based on scrcpy, it uses the same license as scrcpy\n\n    Copyright (C) 2025 Rankun\n    \n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n    \n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n    \n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n## About the author\n\n[Barry CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/rankun1)\n\nAn ordinary programmer, working mainly in C++ for desktop client development, graduated from Shandong for more than a year of steel simulation education software, and later moved to Shanghai to work in security, online education-related fields, familiar with audio and video. I have an understanding of audio and video fields such as voice calls, live education, video conferencing and other related solutions. I also have experience in Android, Linux servers and other kinds of development.\n\n## Contributors\n\n### Code Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
