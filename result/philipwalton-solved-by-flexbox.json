If you have Node.js installed on your system, you can run the following commands to build and serve a local copy.\n\n```sh\n# Clone the git repository and cd into the cloned directory.\ngit clone https://github.com/philipwalton/solved-by-flexbox.git\ncd solved-by-flexbox\n\n# Install the dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Build and serve the site at http://localhost:4000\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis starts up a local server on port 4000. To view the site in your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). If you want to use a different port, you can pass the port number as an argument to `npm start`:\n\n```sh\nnpm start -- -p 8080\n```\n\nIn addition to building the site and serving it locally, this will also listen for any changes and rebuild the site as needed. This allows you to play around with the code, refresh the browser, and see your changes instantly.\n\n## Translations\n\nThe following translations have been graciously provided by the community:\n\n* [Chinese](https://hufan-akari.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/)\n* [Japanese](http://hashrock.github.io/solved-by-flexbox-ja/)\n* [Korean](https://hyunseob.github.io/solved-by-flexbox-kr/)\n\nPlease note that translations are unofficial and may be inaccurate or out of date.
