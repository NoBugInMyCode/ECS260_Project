In the future support for [custom themes](https://github.com/notable/notable/issues/104) will be added as well.\n\nIf you'd like to change a color or hide a button you are also free to do that via the Devtools.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://img.notable.app/screenshot-dark.png\">\n    <img src=\"https://notable.app/static/images/screenshots/dark_mac.png?no-webp\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Dark Theme\" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n### Zen Mode\n\nZen mode provides a minimalistic editing and reading experience, hiding everything that's not necessary.\n\nNotable is also keyboard friendly, has a [quick open](https://img.notable.app/screenshot-quickopen.png) window, and we'll soon add a [command palette](https://github.com/notable/notable/issues/338) too, so you won't have to click any buttons if you don't want to.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://img.notable.app/screenshot-zen.png\">\n    <img src=\"https://notable.app/static/images/screenshots/zen_mac.png?no-webp\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Zen Mode\" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n### Multi-Note Editor\n\nA multi-note editor is available for quickly running an action, like favoriting, pinning, deleting, tagging etc., on multiple notes at once.\n\nIf you need to run a more complex action on your notes remember that they are just file stored on your disk so you can do whatever you want with them.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://img.notable.app/screenshot-multieditor.png\">\n    <img src=\"https://notable.app/static/images/screenshots/multieditor_mac.png?no-webp\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Multi-Note Editor\" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n### Split Editor\n\nA split-editor is available for quickly checking out how your note will be rendered while you're editing it.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://img.notable.app/screenshot-spliteditor.png\">\n    <img src=\"https://notable.app/static/images/screenshots/spliteditor_mac.png?no-webp\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Split Editor\" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n## More Features\n\nA lot more features are implemented, some of the most important ones are listed [here](https://notable.app/#more-features).\n\nIs a feature you care about currently missing?
