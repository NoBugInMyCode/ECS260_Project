It's up-to-date and works offline out-of-the-box.\n\n### Using Docker (Recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to run DevDocs locally is using Docker:\n\n```sh\ndocker run --name devdocs -d -p 9292:9292 ghcr.io/freecodecamp/devdocs:latest\n```\n\nThis will start DevDocs at [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292). We provide both regular and Alpine-based images:\n- `ghcr.io/freecodecamp/devdocs:latest` - Standard image\n- `ghcr.io/freecodecamp/devdocs:latest-alpine` - Alpine-based (smaller size)\n\nImages are automatically built and updated monthly with the latest documentation.\n\nAlternatively, you can build the image yourself:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs.git && cd devdocs\ndocker build -t devdocs .\ndocker run --name devdocs -d -p 9292:9292 devdocs\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nDevDocs is made of two pieces: a Ruby scraper that generates the documentation and metadata, and a JavaScript app powered by a small Sinatra app.\n\nDevDocs requires Ruby 3.3.0 (defined in [`Gemfile`](./Gemfile)), libcurl, and a JavaScript runtime supported by [ExecJS](https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme) (included in OS X and Windows; [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on Linux). Once you have these installed, run the following commands:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs.git && cd devdocs\ngem install bundler\nbundle install\nbundle exec thor docs:download --default\nbundle exec rackup\n```\n\nFinally, point your browser at [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292) (the first request will take a few seconds to compile the assets). You're all set.\n\nThe `thor docs:download` command is used to download pre-generated documentations from DevDocs's servers (e.g. `thor docs:download html css`). You can see the list of available documentations and versions by running `thor docs:list`. To update all downloaded documentations, run `thor docs:download --installed`. To download and install all documentation this project has available, run `thor docs:download --all`.\n\n**Note:** there is currently no update mechanism other than `git pull origin main` to update the code and `thor docs:download --installed` to download the latest version of the docs. To stay informed about new releases, be sure to [watch](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/subscription) this repository.\n\n## Vision\n\nDevDocs aims to make reading and searching reference documentation fast, easy and enjoyable.\n\nThe app's main goals are to:\n\n* Keep load times as short as possible\n* Improve the quality, speed, and order of search results\n* Maximize the use of caching and other performance optimizations\n* Maintain a clean and readable user interface\n* Be fully functional offline\n* Support full keyboard navigation\n* Reduce \u201ccontext switch\u201d by using a consistent typography and design across all documentations\n* Reduce clutter by focusing on a specific category of content (API/reference) and indexing only the minimum useful to most developers.\n\n**Note:** DevDocs is neither a programming guide nor a search engine. All our content is pulled from third-party sources and the project doesn't intend to compete with full-text search engines. Its backbone is metadata; each piece of content is identified by a unique, \"obvious\" and short string. Tutorials, guides and other content that don't meet this requirement are outside the scope of the project.\n\n## App\n\nThe web app is all client-side JavaScript, powered by a small [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com)/[Sprockets](https://github.com/rails/sprockets) application. It relies on files generated by the [scraper](#scraper).\n\nMany of the code's design decisions were driven by the fact that the app uses XHR to load content directly into the main frame. This includes stripping the original documents of most of their HTML markup (e.g. scripts and stylesheets) to avoid polluting the main frame, and prefixing all CSS class names with an underscore to prevent conflicts.\n\nAnother driving factor is performance and the fact that everything happens in the browser. A service worker (which comes with its own set of constraints) and `localStorage` are used to speed up the boot time, while memory consumption is kept in check by allowing the user to pick his/her own set of documentations. The search algorithm is kept simple because it needs to be fast even searching through 100,000 strings.\n\nDevDocs being a developer tool, the browser requirements are high:\n\n* Recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, or Opera\n* Safari 11.1+\n* Edge 17+\n* iOS 11.3+\n\nThis allows the code to take advantage of the latest DOM and HTML5 APIs and make developing DevDocs a lot more fun!\n\n## Scraper\n\nThe scraper is responsible for generating the documentation and index files (metadata) used by the [app](#app). It's written in Ruby under the `Docs` module.\n\nThere are currently two kinds of scrapers: `UrlScraper` which downloads files via HTTP and `FileScraper` which reads them from the local filesystem. They both make copies of HTML documents, recursively following links that match a set of rules and applying all sorts of modifications along the way, in addition to building an index of the files and their metadata. Documents are parsed using [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org).\n\nModifications made to each document include:\n\n* removing content such as the document structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, etc.), comments, empty nodes, etc.\n* fixing links (e.g. to remove duplicates)\n* replacing all external (not scraped) URLs with their fully qualified counterpart\n* replacing all internal (scraped) URLs with their unqualified and relative counterpart\n* adding content, such as a title and link to the original document\n* ensuring correct syntax highlighting using [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)\n\nThese modifications are applied via a set of filters using the [HTML::Pipeline](https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline) library. Each scraper includes filters specific to itself, one of which is tasked with figuring out the pages' metadata.\n\nThe end result is a set of normalized HTML partials and two JSON files (index + offline data). Because the index files are loaded separately by the [app](#app) following the user's preferences, the scraper also creates a JSON manifest file containing information about the documentations currently available on the system (such as their name, version, update date, etc.).\n\nMore information about [scrapers](./docs/scraper-reference.md) and [filters](./docs/filter-reference.md) is available in the `docs` folder.\n\n## Available Commands\n\nThe command-line interface uses [Thor](http://whatisthor.com). To see all commands and options, run `thor list` from the project's root.\n\n```sh\n# Server\nrackup              # Start the server (ctrl+c to stop)\nrackup --help       # List server options\n\n# Docs\nthor docs:list      # List available documentations\nthor docs:download  # Download one or more documentations\nthor docs:manifest  # Create the manifest file used by the app\nthor docs:generate  # Generate/scrape a documentation\nthor docs:page      # Generate/scrape a documentation page\nthor docs:package   # Package a documentation for use with docs:download\nthor docs:clean     # Delete documentation packages\n\n# Console\nthor console        # Start a REPL\nthor console:docs   # Start a REPL in the \"Docs\" module\n\n# Tests can be run quickly from within the console using the \"test\" command.\n# Run \"help test\" for usage instructions.\nthor test:all       # Run all tests\nthor test:docs      # Run \"Docs\" tests\nthor test:app       # Run \"App\" tests\n\n# Assets\nthor assets:compile # Compile assets (not required in development mode)\nthor assets:clean   # Clean old assets\n```\n\nIf multiple versions of Ruby are installed on your system, commands must be run through `bundle exec`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome.
