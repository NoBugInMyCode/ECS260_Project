Refer to [docs/license.txt](docs/license.txt) for more information.\n\n### Installation ###\n\nDownload the [latest release](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) and unpack it in the desired location. Please remember to use `7z x` when unpacking the archive from the command line to ensure full file paths remain intact.\n\n### Usage/Help ###\n\nPlease refer to the [Hashcat Wiki](https://hashcat.net/wiki/) and the output of `--help` for usage information and general help. A list of frequently asked questions may also be found [here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions). The [Hashcat Forum](https://hashcat.net/forum/) also contains a plethora of information. If you still think you need help by a real human come to [Discord](https://discord.gg/HFS523HGBT).\n\n### Building ###\n\nRefer to [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for instructions on how to build **hashcat** from source.\n\nTests:\n\nTravis | Coverity | GitHub Actions\n------ | -------- | --------------\n[![Hashcat Travis Build status](https://travis-ci.org/hashcat/hashcat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hashcat/hashcat) | [![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/11753/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/hashcat) | [![Hashcat GitHub Actions Build status](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/actions/workflows/build.yml)\n\n### Contributing ###\n\nContributions are welcome and encouraged, provided your code is of sufficient quality. Before submitting a pull request, please ensure your code adheres to the following requirements:\n\n1. Licensed under MIT license, or dedicated to the public domain (BSD, GPL, etc. code is incompatible)\n2. Adheres to gnu99 standard\n3. Compiles cleanly with no warnings when compiled with `-W -Wall -std=gnu99`\n4. Uses [Allman-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style) code blocks & indentation\n5. Uses 2-spaces as the indentation or a tab if it's required (for example: Makefiles)\n6. Uses lower-case function and variable names\n7. Avoids the use of `!` and uses positive conditionals wherever possible (e.g., `if (foo == 0)` instead of `if (!foo)`, and `if (foo)` instead of `if (foo != 0)`)\n8. Use code like array[index + 0] if you also need to do array[index + 1], to keep it aligned\n\nYou can use GNU Indent to help assist you with the style requirements:\n\n```\nindent -st -bad -bap -sc -bl -bli0 -ncdw -nce -cli0 -cbi0 -pcs -cs -npsl -bs -nbc -bls -blf -lp -i2 -ts2 -nut -l1024 -nbbo -fca -lc1024 -fc1\n```\n\nYour pull request should fully describe the functionality you are adding/removing or the problem you are solving. Regardless of whether your patch modifies one line or one thousand lines, you must describe what has prompted and/or motivated the change.\n\nSolve only one problem in each pull request. If you're fixing a bug and adding a new feature, you need to make two separate pull requests. If you're fixing three bugs, you need to make three separate pull requests. If you're adding four new features, you need to make four separate pull requests. So on, and so forth.\n\nIf your patch fixes a bug, please be sure there is an [issue](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/issues) open for the bug before submitting a pull request. If your patch aims to improve performance or optimize an algorithm, be sure to quantify your optimizations and document the trade-offs, and back up your claims with benchmarks and metrics.\n\nIn order to maintain the quality and integrity of the **hashcat** source tree, all pull requests must be reviewed and signed off by at least two [board members](https://github.com/orgs/hashcat/people) before being merged. The [project lead](https://github.com/jsteube) has the ultimate authority in deciding whether to accept or reject a pull request. Do not be discouraged if your pull request is rejected!\n\n### Happy Cracking!\n",
