Learners can use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TEGSUQDFuWL3TYNjiM8G3esly-tKOcgHSDABt92mzdA/copy) to estimate their end date. Make a copy and input your start date and expected hours per week in the `Timeline` sheet. As you work through courses you can enter your actual course completion dates in the Curriculum Data sheet and get updated completion estimates.\n\n> **Warning:** While the spreadsheet is a useful tool to estimate the time you need to complete this curriculum, it may not be up-to-date with the curriculum. Use the spreadsheet just to estimate the time you need. Use the [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/ossu/data-science) to see what courses to do.\n\n### Order of the classes\n\nSome courses can be taken in parallel, while others must be taken sequentially. All of the courses within a topic should be taken in the order listed in the curriculum. The graph below demonstrates how topics should be ordered.\n\n<img src=\"./topic_progression_graph.jpg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Topic Progression Graph\" />\n\n### Track your progress\n\n[Fork](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-fork-a-github-repository/) the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ossu/data-science) into your own GitHub account and put \u2705 next to the stuff you've completed as you complete it. This can serve as your [kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) and will be faster to implement than any other solution (giving you time to spend on the courses).\n\n### Which programming languages should I use?\n\nPython and R are heavily used in Data Science community and our courses teach you both. Remember, the important thing for each course is to internalize the core concepts and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.\n\n### Content Policy\n\nYou must share only files that you are allowed. **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you sign in the beginning of your courses.\n\n## Community\n\nWe have a Discord server! This should be your first stop to talk with other OSSU students. [Why don't you introduce yourself right now?](https://discord.gg/wuytwK5s9h)\n\nYou can also interact through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/open-source-society/data-science/issues).\n\nAdd **Open Source Society University** to your [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/school/11272443/) profile!\n\n> **Warning:** There are a few third-party/deprecated/outdated material that you might find when searching for OSSU. We recommend you to ignore them, and only use the [OSSU Data Science Github Repo](https://github.com/ossu/data-science). Some known outdated materials are:\n>  - An unmaintained and deprecated trello board\n>  - Third-party notion templates\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThe Data Science curriculum assumes the student has taken [high school math](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites) and [statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability).\n\n## Curriculum\n\n- [Introduction to Data Science](#introduction-to-data-science)\n- [Introduction to Computer Science](#introduction-to-computer-science)\n- [Data Structures and Algorithms](#data-structures-and-algorithms)\n- [Databases](#databases)\n- [Single Variable Calculus](#single-variable-calculus)\n- [Linear Algebra](#linear-algebra)\n- [Multivariable Calculus](#multivariable-calculus)\n- [Statistics & Probability](#statistics--probability)\n- [Data Science Tools & Methods](#data-science-tools--methods)\n- [Machine Learning/Data Mining](#machine-learningdata-mining)\n- [Final project](#final-project)\n\n### Introduction to Data Science\n\n[What is Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience)\n\n### Introduction to Computer Science\n\n_Students who already know basic programming in any language can skip this first course_\n\n[Introduction to programming](coursepages/intro-programming/README.md)\n\n[Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](coursepages/intro-cs/README.md)\n\n[Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/)\n\n### Data Structures and Algorithms\n\n_The Algorithms courses are taught in Java.

real-world problems.\n\nAfter you've completed the curriculum,\nyou should identify a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.\nYou can create something entirely new, or you can improve some tool/program that you use and wish were better.\n\nStudents who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses.\nA sample of options\n(many more are available, at this point you should be capable of identifying a series that is interesting and relevant to you)\nare available on [this page](extras/specializations.md).\n\n### Congratulations\n\nAfter completing the requirements of the curriculum above,\nyou will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Data Science.\nCongratulations!\n\nWhat is next for you? The possibilities are boundless and overlapping:\n\n- Look for a job as a data scientist!\n- Check out the [readings](extras/books.md) for classic books you can read that will sharpen your skills and expand your knowledge.\n- Join a local data science meetup (e.g. via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)).\n- Pay attention to emerging technologies in the world of data science.\n\n![keep learning](https://i.imgur.com/REQK0VU.jpg)\n\n## How to contribute\n\nYou can [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and give us your suggestions as to how we can improve this guide, or what we can do to improve the learning experience.\n\nYou can also [fork this project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to fix any mistakes that you have found.\n\nIf you want to suggest a new resource, send a pull request adding such resource to the [extras](https://github.com/open-source-society/data-science/tree/master/extras) section. The **extras** section is a place where all of us will be able to submit interesting additional articles, books, courses and specializations.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n[OSSU's code of conduct](https://github.com/ossu/code-of-conduct).\n\n## Team\n\n* **Curriculum Maintainer**: [Waciuma Wanjohi](https://github.com/waciumawanjohi)\n* **Contributors**: [contributors](https://github.com/open-source-society/data-science/graphs/contributors)\n",
