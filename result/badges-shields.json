The service supports dozens of\ncontinuous integration services, package registries, distributions, app\nstores, social networks, code coverage services, and code analysis services.\nEvery month it serves over 1.6 billion images and is used by some of the\nworld's most popular open-source projects, [VS Code][vscode], [Vue.js][vue]\nand [Bootstrap][bootstrap] to name a few.\n\n[vscode]: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode\n[vue]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue\n[bootstrap]: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap\n\nThis repo hosts:\n\n- The [Shields.io][shields.io] frontend and server code\n- An [NPM library for generating badges][badge-maker]\n  - [documentation][badge-maker-docs]\n  - [changelog][badge-maker-changelog]\n- The [badge design specification][badge-spec]\n\n[shields.io]: https://shields.io/\n[badge-maker]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/badge-maker\n[badge-spec]: https://github.com/badges/shields/tree/master/spec\n[badge-maker-docs]: https://github.com/badges/shields/tree/master/badge-maker/README.md\n[badge-maker-changelog]: https://github.com/badges/shields/tree/master/badge-maker/CHANGELOG.md\n\n## Examples\n\n- code coverage percentage: ![coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-80%25-yellowgreen)\n- stable release version: ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.2.3-blue)\n- package manager release: ![gem](https://img.shields.io/badge/gem-2.2.0-blue)\n- status of third-party dependencies: ![dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-out%20of%20date-orange)\n- static code analysis grade: ![codacy](https://img.shields.io/badge/codacy-B-green)\n- [SemVer](https://semver.org/) version observance: ![semver](https://img.shields.io/badge/semver-2.0.0-blue)\n- amount of [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/) donations per week: ![receives](https://img.shields.io/badge/receives-2.00%20USD%2Fweek-yellow)\n- Python package downloads: ![downloads](https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-13k%2Fmonth-brightgreen)\n- Chrome Web Store extension rating: ![rating](https://img.shields.io/badge/rating-\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606-brightgreen)\n- Uptime Robot uptime percentage: ![uptime](https://img.shields.io/badge/uptime-100%25-brightgreen)\n\n[Make your own badges!][custom badges]\n(Quick example: `https://img.shields.io/badge/left-right-f39f37`)\n\n[custom badges]: https://img.shields.io/badges/static-badge\n\n### Quickstart\n\nBrowse a [complete list of badges][shields.io] and locate a particular badge by using the search bar or by browsing the categories. Click on the badge to fill in required data elements for that badge type (like your username or repo) and optionally customize (label, colors etc.). And it's ready for use!\n\nUse the button at the bottom to copy your badge url or snippet, which can then be added to places like your GitHub readme files or other web pages.\n\n## Contributing\n\nShields is a community project. We invite your participation through issues\nand pull requests! You can peruse the [contributing guidelines][contributing].\n\nWhen adding or changing a service [please add tests][service-tests].\n\nThis project has quite a backlog of suggestions! If you're new to the project,\nmaybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of them.\n\nYou can read a [tutorial on how to add a badge][tutorial].\n\n[![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/badges/shields/good%20first%20issue)](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\n\nIf you intend on reporting or contributing a fix related to security vulnerabilities, please first refer to our [security policy][security].\n\n[service-tests]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/service-tests.md\n[tutorial]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md\n[contributing]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[security]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/SECURITY.md\n\n## Development\n\n1. Install Node 20 or later. You can use the [package manager][] of your choice.\n   Tests need to pass in Node 20 and 22.\n2. Clone this repository.\n3. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.\n4. Run `npm start` to start the badge server and the frontend dev server.\n5. Open `http://localhost:3000/` to view the frontend.\n\nWhen server source files change, the badge server should automatically restart\nitself (using [nodemon][]). When the frontend files change, the frontend dev\nserver (`docusaurus start`) should also automatically reload. However the badge\ndefinitions are built only before the server first starts. To regenerate those,\neither run `npm run prestart` or manually restart the server.\n\nTo debug a badge from the command line, run `npm run badge -- /npm/v/nock`.\nIt also works with full URLs like\n`npm run badge -- https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nock`.\n\nUse `npm run debug:server` to start server in debug mode.\n[This recipe][nodemon debug] shows how to debug Node.js application in [VS Code][].\n\nShields has experimental support for [Gitpod][gitpod], a pre-configured development\nenvironment that runs in your browser. To use Gitpod, click the button below and\nsign in with GitHub. Gitpod also offers a browser add-on, though it is not required.\nPlease report any Gitpod bugs, questions, or suggestions in issue\n[#2772](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/2772).\n\n[![Edit with Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/badges/shields)\n\n[Snapshot tests][] ensure we don't inadvertently make changes that affect the\nSVG or JSON output. When deliberately changing the output, run\n`SNAPSHOT_DRY=1 npm run test:package` to preview changes to the saved\nsnapshots, and `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 npm run test:package` to update them.\n\nThe server can be configured to use [Sentry][] ([configuration][sentry configuration]) and [Prometheus][] ([configuration][prometheus configuration]).\n\nOur [full test suite][full test suite] as well as [code coverage][code coverage] are run on a daily basis.\n\n[package manager]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/\n[gitpod]: https://www.gitpod.io/\n[snapshot tests]: https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/snapshot-testing/\n[prometheus]: https://prometheus.io/\n[prometheus configuration]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md#prometheus\n[sentry]: https://sentry.io/\n[sentry configuration]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md#sentry\n[nodemon]: https://nodemon.io/\n[nodemon debug]: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/nodemon\n[vs code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\n[full test suite]: https://github.com/badges/shields/actions/workflows/daily-tests.yml\n[code coverage]: https://coveralls.io/github/badges/shields\n\n## Hosting your own server\n\nThere is documentation about [hosting your own server][self-hosting].\n\n[self-hosting]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md\n\n## Related projects\n\n[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n\nStatus badges are used widely across open-source and private software projects.\nAcademics have studied the \"signal\" badges provide about software project\nquality. There are many existing libraries for rendering these badges, and\nalternatives to the hosted Shields badge service. [awesome-badges][] is a\ncurated collection of such resources.\n[Contributions][contributing to awesome-badges] may be considered there.\n(The presence of a project in that collection should not be interpreted as an endorsement nor promotion from the Shields project)\n\n[awesome-badges]: https://github.com/badges/awesome-badges\n[contributing to awesome-badges]: https://github.com/badges/awesome-badges/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\n## History\n\nb.adge.me was the original website for this service. Heroku back then had a\nthing which made it hard to use a toplevel domain with it, hence the odd\ndomain. It used code developed in 2013 from a library called\n[gh-badges][old-gh-badges], both developed by [Thadd\u00e9e Tyl][espadrine].\nThe project merged with shields.io by making it use the b.adge.me code\nand closed b.adge.me.\n\nThe original badge specification was developed in 2013 by\n[Olivier Lacan][olivierlacan]. It was inspired by the Travis CI and similar\nbadges (there were a lot fewer, back then). In 2014 Thadd\u00e9e Tyl redesigned\nit with help from a Travis CI employee and convinced everyone to switch to\nit. The old design is what today is called the plastic style; the new one\nis the flat style.\n\nYou can read more about [the project's inception][thread],\n[the motivation of the SVG badge specification][motivation], and\n[the specification itself][spec].\n\n[olivierlacan]: https://github.com/olivierlacan\n[espadrine]: https://github.com/espadrine\n[old-gh-badges]: https://github.com/badges/gh-badges\n[motivation]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/spec/motivation.md\n[spec]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/spec/SPECIFICATION.md\n[thread]: https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/150\n\n## Project leaders\n\nMaintainers:\n\n- [calebcartwright](https://github.com/calebcartwright)\n- [chris48s](https://github.com/chris48s)\n- [jNullj](https://github.com/jnullj)\n- [paulmelnikow](https://github.com/paulmelnikow)\n- [PyvesB](https://github.com/PyvesB)\n\nAlumni:\n\n- [Daniel15](https://github.com/Daniel15)\n- [espadrine](https://github.com/espadrine)\n- [olivierlacan](https://github.com/olivierlacan)\n- [platan](https://github.com/platan)\n- [RedSparr0w](https://github.com/RedSparr0w)\n\n## License\n\nAll assets and code are under the [CC0 LICENSE](LICENSE) and in the public\ndomain unless specified otherwise.\n\n## Community\n\nThanks to the people and companies who donate money, services or time to keep the project running.
