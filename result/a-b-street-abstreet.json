A/B Street is a project to plan, simulate, and\ncommunicate visions for making cities friendlier to people walking, biking, and\ntaking public transit. We create software to\n[simulate traffic, edit streets and intersections](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/software/abstreet.html),\n[plan bike networks](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/software/ungap_the_map/index.html),\ncreate\n[low-traffic neighborhoods](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/software/ltn/index.html),\nand educate the public about\n[15-minute neighborhoods through games](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/software/santa.html).\nThe project works anywhere in the world, thanks to\n[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about).\n\n- Run it on [your web browser](https://play.abstreet.org/0.3.49/abstreet.html),\n  [Windows](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/releases/download/v0.3.49/abstreet_windows_v0_3_49.zip),\n  [Mac](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/releases/download/v0.3.49/abstreet_mac_v0_3_49.zip),\n  [Linux](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/releases/download/v0.3.49/abstreet_linux_v0_3_49.zip),\n  [FreeBSD](https://www.freshports.org/games/abstreet/), or\n  [read all instructions](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/user/index.html)\n- [build from source](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/tech/dev/index.html)\n\nAs of January 2024, development of the tools above has slowed down, because\nnewer tools are being developed in other repositories. Please also check out:\n\n- [Severance Snape](https://dabreegster.github.io/severance_snape) to explore\n  how far walking routes detour to cross big roads\n- [od2net](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics-Technology-Platform/od2net) to\n  calculate the most important roads to prioritize for cycling\n\n## Videos\n\n- [Alpha release trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxPD4n_1-LU)\n- [Presentations](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/project/presentations.html)\n\n![](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/project/history/retrospective/traffic_sim.gif)\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [User guide](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/user/index.html)\n- Technical\n  - [Developer guide](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/tech/dev/index.html)\n  - [How the traffic simulation works](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/tech/trafficsim/discrete_event/index.html)\n  - [Intersection geometry](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/tech/map/geometry/index.html)\n- Project\n  - [Roadmap](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/software/ungap_the_map/plan.html#future-directions)\n  - [Getting involved](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/project/contributing.html)\n  - [Accomplishments & challenges](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/project/history/retrospective/index.html)\n\n## Project mission\n\nWe amplify the efforts of individuals and advocacy groups who campaign to\ntransition cities away from private motor vehicles. We believe in transparent\nand reproducible analysis, so all of our work is open source and based on public\ndata. We believe everybody should have a voice in shaping their city, so our\nsoftware aims to be easy to use.\n\nWhy not leave city planning to professionals? People are local experts on the\nsmall slice of the city they interact with daily -- the one left turn lane that\nalways backs up or a certain set of poorly timed walk signals.\n[Laura Adler](http://www.govtech.com/data/SimCities-Can-City-Planning-Mistakes-Be-Avoided-Through-Data-Driven-Simulations.html)\nwrites:\n\n> \"Only with simple, accessible simulation programs can citizens become active\n> generators of their own urban visions, not just passive recipients of options\n> laid out by government officials.\"\n\nExisting urban planning software is either proprietary or hard to use. A/B\nStreet strives to be highly accessible, by being a fun, engaging game. See\n[here](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/project/motivations.html) for more\nguiding principles.\n\n## Credits\n\nCore team:\n\n- Dustin Carlino (<dabreegster@gmail.com>)\n- [Yuwen Li](https://www.yuwen-li.com/) (UX)\n- [Michael Kirk](https://github.com/michaelkirk)\n\n[See full credits](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/project/team.html)\n\nContact <dabreegster@gmail.com> or follow\n[@CarlinoDustin](https://twitter.com/CarlinoDustin) for updates.\n",
