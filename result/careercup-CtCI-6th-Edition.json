Solutions in other programming languages are contributed by the community and each have\ntheir own dedicated repos which are referenced from this repo as git submodules. What this means for cloning:\n\n- If you want to make a local clone of solutions in all languages, you should use the `--recursive` option:\n\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition.git\n\n- If you're only interested in the Java solutions:\n\n        git clone https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition.git\n\n- If you originally cloned without `--recursive`, and then later decide you want the git submodules too, run:\n\n        git submodule update --init --recursive\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Work Flow\n1. Fork the appropriate repo for your language to your GitHub user. (see [Where to submit pull requests](#where-to-submit-pull-requests))\n2. Write quality code and lint if applicable.\n3. Add tests if applicable.\n4. Open a pull request and provide a descriptive comment for what you did.\n\n### Where to submit pull requests\n\nPull requests pertaining to Java solutions should be submitted to the main [CtCI-6th-Edition repo](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition). Please submit pull requests for all other languages to the appropriate language-specific repo.\n\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-Clojure](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Clojure)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-C](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-C)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-cpp](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-cpp)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-CSharp](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-CSharp)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-Go](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Go)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-Groovy](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Groovy)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-Haskell](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Haskell)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript-ES2015](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript-ES2015)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-Julia](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Julia)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-Kotlin](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Kotlin)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-Objective-C](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Objective-C)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-php](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-php)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-Python](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Python)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-Ruby](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Ruby)\n- [CtCI-6th-Edition-Swift](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Swift)\n\n### Adding a new Language\n\nSolutions in other languages are welcome too and should follow this workflow:\n\n1. Create the new repo under your own GitHub user account and start contributing solutions. The repo name should follow this naming convention: `CtCI-6th-Edition-<language>`.\n2. Open an [issue on the CtCI-6th-Edition repo](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition/issues) to request that your solution repo be promoted to join the careercup GitHub organization and referenced from the main repo as a git submodule.\n3. If your request is approved, navigate to your repo's settings page and select the \"Transfer Ownership\" option, and specify \"careercup\" as the new owner.\n\n",
