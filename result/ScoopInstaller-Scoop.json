It:\n\n- Eliminates [User Account Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/application-security/application-control/user-account-control/) (UAC) prompt notifications.\n- Hides the graphical user interface (GUI) of wizard-style installers.\n- Prevents polluting the `PATH` environment variable. Normally, this variable gets cluttered as different apps are installed on the device.\n- Avoids unexpected side effects from installing and uninstalling apps.\n- Resolves and installs dependencies automatically.\n- Performs all the necessary steps to get an app to a working state.\n\nScoop is quite script-friendly. Your environment can become the way you like by using repeatable setups. For example:\n\n```console\nscoop install sudo\nsudo scoop install 7zip git openssh --global\nscoop install aria2 curl grep sed less touch\nscoop install python ruby go perl\n```\n\nIf you have built software that you would like others to use, Scoop is an alternative to building an installer (like MSI or InnoSetup). You just need to compress your app to a `.zip` file and provide a JSON manifest that describes how to install it.\n\n## Installation\n\nRun the following commands from a regular (non-admin) PowerShell terminal to install Scoop:\n\n```powershell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\nInvoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression\n```\n\n**Note**: The first command makes your device allow running the installation and management scripts. This is necessary because Windows 10 client devices restrict execution of any PowerShell scripts by default.\n\nIt will install Scoop to its default location:\n\n`C:\\Users\\<YOUR USERNAME>\\scoop`\n\nYou can find the complete documentation about the installer, including advanced installation configurations, in [ScoopInstaller/Install](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Install). Please create new issues there if you have questions about the installation.\n\n## Multi-connection downloads with `aria2`\n\nScoop can utilize [`aria2`](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) to use multi-connection downloads. Simply install `aria2` through Scoop and it will be used for all downloads afterward.\n\n```console\nscoop install aria2\n```\n\nBy default, `scoop` displays a warning when running `scoop install` or `scoop update` while `aria2` is enabled. This warning can be suppressed by running `scoop config aria2-warning-enabled false`.\n\nYou can tweak the following `aria2` settings with the `scoop config` command:\n\n- aria2-enabled (default: true)\n- aria2-warning-enabled (default: true)\n- [aria2-retry-wait](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-retry-wait) (default: 2)\n- [aria2-split](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-s) (default: 5)\n- [aria2-max-connection-per-server](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-x) (default: 5)\n- [aria2-min-split-size](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-k) (default: 5M)\n- [aria2-options](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#options) (default: )\n\n## Inspiration\n\n- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)\n- [Sub](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3264-automating-with-convention-introducing-sub)\n\n## What sort of apps can Scoop install?\n\nThe apps that are most likely to get installed fine with Scoop are those referred to as \"portable\" apps. These apps are compressed files which can run standalone after being extracted. This type of apps does not produce side effects like changing the Windows Registry or placing files outside the app directory.\n\nScoop also supports installer files and their uninstallation methods. Likewise, it can handle single-file apps and PowerShell scripts. These do not even need to be compressed. See the [runat](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/blob/master/bucket/runat.json) package for an example: it is simply a GitHub gist.\n\n### Contribute to this project\n\nIf you would like to improve Scoop by adding features or fixing bugs, please read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Support this project\n\nIf you find Scoop useful and would like to support the ongoing development and maintenance of this project, you can donate here:\n\n- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DM2SUH9EUXSKJ) (one-time donations)\n\n## Known application buckets\n\nThe following buckets are known to Scoop:\n\n- [main](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main) - Default bucket which contains popular non-GUI apps.\n- [extras](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras) - Apps that do not fit the main bucket's [criteria](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/wiki/Criteria-for-including-apps-in-the-main-bucket).\n- [games](https://github.com/Calinou/scoop-games) - Open-source and freeware video games and game-related tools.\n- [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/matthewjberger/scoop-nerd-fonts) -  Nerd Fonts.\n- [nirsoft](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Nirsoft) - A collection of over 250+ apps from [Nirsoft](https://nirsoft.net).\n- [sysinternals](https://github.com/niheaven/scoop-sysinternals) - The Sysinternals suite from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/sysinternals/).\n- [java](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Java) - A collection of Java development kits (JDKs) and Java runtime engines (JREs), Java's virtual machine debugging tools and Java based runtime engines.\n- [nonportable](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Nonportable) - Non-portable apps (may trigger UAC prompts).\n- [php](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/PHP) - Installers for most versions of PHP.\n- [versions](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Versions) - Alternative versions of apps found in other buckets.\n\nThe `main` bucket is installed by default. You can make use of more buckets by typing:\n\n```console\nscoop bucket add <name>\n```\n\nFor example, to add the `extras` bucket, type:\n\n```console\nscoop bucket add extras\n```\n\nYou would be able to install apps from the `extras` bucket now.\n\n## Other application buckets\n\nMany other application buckets hosted on GitHub can be found on [ScoopSearch](https://scoop.sh/) or via [other search engines](https://rasa.github.io/scoop-directory/#other-search-engines).\n",
