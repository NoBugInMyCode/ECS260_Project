Works with `go test`. Use it in the terminal or browser according to your viewing pleasure.\n\nGoConvey supports the current versions of Go (see the official Go\n[release policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release#policy)). Currently\nthis means Go 1.16 and Go 1.17 are supported.\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Directly integrates with `go test`\n- Fully-automatic web UI (works with native Go tests, too)\n- Huge suite of regression tests\n- Shows test coverage\n- Readable, colorized console output (understandable by any manager, IT or not)\n- Test code generator\n- Desktop notifications (optional)\n- Immediately open problem lines in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) ([some assembly required](https://github.com/asuth/subl-handler))\n\n\nYou can ask questions about how to use GoConvey on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=goconvey,go&title=GoConvey%3A%20). Use the tags `go` and `goconvey`.\n\n**Menu:**\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Quick start](#quick-start)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Screenshots](#screenshots)\n- [Contributors](#contributors)\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n\t$ go install github.com/smartystreets/goconvey\n\n[Quick start](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki#get-going-in-25-seconds)\n-----------\n\nMake a test, for example:\n\n```go\npackage package_name\n\nimport (\n    \"testing\"\n    . \"github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/convey\"\n)\n\nfunc TestSpec(t *testing.T) {\n\n\t// Only pass t into top-level Convey calls\n\tConvey(\"Given some integer with a starting value\", t, func() {\n\t\tx := 1\n\n\t\tConvey(\"When the integer is incremented\", func() {\n\t\t\tx++\n\n\t\t\tConvey(\"The value should be greater by one\", func() {\n\t\t\t\tSo(x, ShouldEqual, 2)\n\t\t\t})\n\t\t})\n\t})\n}\n```\n\n\n#### [In the browser](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki/Web-UI)\n\nStart up the GoConvey web server at your project's path:\n\n\t$ $GOPATH/bin/goconvey\n\nThen watch the test results display in your browser at:\n\n\thttp://localhost:8080\n\n\nIf the browser doesn't open automatically, please click [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to open manually.\n\nThere you have it.\n![](http://d79i1fxsrar4t.cloudfront.net/goconvey.co/gc-1-dark.png)\nAs long as GoConvey is running, test results will automatically update in your browser window.\n\n![](http://d79i1fxsrar4t.cloudfront.net/goconvey.co/gc-5-dark.png)\nThe design is responsive, so you can squish the browser real tight if you need to put it beside your code.\n\n\nThe [web UI](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki/Web-UI) supports traditional Go tests, so use it even if you're not using GoConvey tests.\n\n\n\n#### [In the terminal](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki/Execution)\n\nJust do what you do best:\n\n    $ go test\n\nOr if you want the output to include the story:\n\n    $ go test -v\n\n\n[Documentation](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki)\n-----------\n\nCheck out the\n\n- [GoConvey wiki](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki),\n- [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/smartystreets/goconvey?status.png)](http://godoc.org/github.com/smartystreets/goconvey)\n- and the *_test.go files scattered throughout this project.\n\nContributors\n----------------------\n\nGoConvey is brought to you by [SmartyStreets](https://github.com/smartystreets) and [several contributors](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/graphs/contributors) (Thanks!).\n",
