By using dynamic translation,\nit achieves very good performance. QEMU can also integrate with the Xen\nand KVM hypervisors to provide emulated hardware while allowing the\nhypervisor to manage the CPU. With hypervisor support, QEMU can achieve\nnear native performance for CPUs. When QEMU emulates CPUs directly it is\ncapable of running operating systems made for one machine (e.g. an ARMv7\nboard) on a different machine (e.g. an x86_64 PC board).\n\nQEMU is also capable of providing userspace API virtualization for Linux\nand BSD kernel interfaces. This allows binaries compiled against one\narchitecture ABI (e.g. the Linux PPC64 ABI) to be run on a host using a\ndifferent architecture ABI (e.g. the Linux x86_64 ABI). This does not\ninvolve any hardware emulation, simply CPU and syscall emulation.\n\nQEMU aims to fit into a variety of use cases. It can be invoked directly\nby users wishing to have full control over its behaviour and settings.\nIt also aims to facilitate integration into higher level management\nlayers, by providing a stable command line interface and monitor API.\nIt is commonly invoked indirectly via the libvirt library when using\nopen source applications such as oVirt, OpenStack and virt-manager.\n\nQEMU as a whole is released under the GNU General Public License,\nversion 2. For full licensing details, consult the LICENSE file.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nDocumentation can be found hosted online at\n`<https://www.qemu.org/documentation/>`_. The documentation for the\ncurrent development version that is available at\n`<https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/>`_ is generated from the ``docs/``\nfolder in the source tree, and is built by `Sphinx\n<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_.\n\n\nBuilding\n========\n\nQEMU is multi-platform software intended to be buildable on all modern\nLinux platforms, OS-X, Win32 (via the Mingw64 toolchain) and a variety\nof other UNIX targets. The simple steps to build QEMU are:\n\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n  mkdir build\n  cd build\n  ../configure\n  make\n\nAdditional information can also be found online via the QEMU website:\n\n* `<https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/Linux>`_\n* `<https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/Mac>`_\n* `<https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/W32>`_\n\n\nSubmitting patches\n==================\n\nThe QEMU source code is maintained under the GIT version control system.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   git clone https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu.git\n\nWhen submitting patches, one common approach is to use 'git\nformat-patch' and/or 'git send-email' to format & send the mail to the\nqemu-devel@nongnu.org mailing list. All patches submitted must contain\na 'Signed-off-by' line from the author. Patches should follow the\nguidelines set out in the `style section\n<https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/style.html>`_ of\nthe Developers Guide.\n\nAdditional information on submitting patches can be found online via\nthe QEMU website:\n\n* `<https://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch>`_\n* `<https://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/TrivialPatches>`_\n\nThe QEMU website is also maintained under source control.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n  git clone https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu-web.git\n\n* `<https://www.qemu.org/2017/02/04/the-new-qemu-website-is-up/>`_\n\nA 'git-publish' utility was created to make above process less\ncumbersome, and is highly recommended for making regular contributions,\nor even just for sending consecutive patch series revisions. It also\nrequires a working 'git send-email' setup, and by default doesn't\nautomate everything, so you may want to go through the above steps\nmanually for once.\n\nFor installation instructions, please go to:\n\n*  `<https://github.com/stefanha/git-publish>`_\n\nThe workflow with 'git-publish' is:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n  $ git checkout master -b my-feature\n  $ # work on new commits, add your 'Signed-off-by' lines to each\n  $ git publish\n\nYour patch series will be sent and tagged as my-feature-v1 if you need to refer\nback to it in the future.\n\nSending v2:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n  $ git checkout my-feature # same topic branch\n  $ # making changes to the commits (using 'git rebase', for example)\n  $ git publish\n\nYour patch series will be sent with 'v2' tag in the subject and the git tip\nwill be tagged as my-feature-v2.\n\nBug reporting\n=============\n\nThe QEMU project uses GitLab issues to track bugs. Bugs\nfound when running code built from QEMU git or upstream released sources\nshould be reported via:\n\n* `<https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues>`_\n\nIf using QEMU via an operating system vendor pre-built binary package, it\nis preferable to report bugs to the vendor's own bug tracker first. If\nthe bug is also known to affect latest upstream code, it can also be\nreported via GitLab.\n\nFor additional information on bug reporting consult:\n\n* `<https://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/ReportABug>`_\n\n\nChangeLog\n=========\n\nFor version history and release notes, please visit\n`<https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/>`_ or look at the git history for\nmore detailed information.\n\n\nContact\n=======\n\nThe QEMU community can be contacted in a number of ways, with the two\nmain methods being email and IRC:\n\n* `<mailto:qemu-devel@nongnu.org>`_\n* `<https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/qemu-devel>`_\n* #qemu on irc.oftc.net\n\nInformation on additional methods of contacting the community can be\nfound online via the QEMU website:\n\n* `<https://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/StartHere>`_\n",
