Ideal for generating Python package projects and more.\n\n- [Documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)\n- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/)\n- [License (BSD)](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall cookiecutter using pip package manager:\n```\n# pipx is strongly recommended.\npipx install cookiecutter\n\n# If pipx is not an option,\n# you can install cookiecutter in your Python user directory.\npython -m pip install --user cookiecutter\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- **Cross-Platform:** Supports Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n- **User-Friendly:** No Python knowledge required.\n- **Versatile:** Compatible with Python 3.7 to 3.12.\n- **Multi-Language Support:** Use templates in any language or markup format.\n\n### For Users\n\n#### Quick Start\n\nThe recommended way to use Cookiecutter as a command line utility is to run it with [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), which can be installed with `pip install pipx`, but if you plan to use Cookiecutter programmatically, please run `pip install cookiecutter`.\n\n**Use a GitHub template**\n\n```bash\n# You'll be prompted to enter values.\n# Then it'll create your Python package in the current working directory,\n# based on those values.\n# For the sake of brevity, repos on GitHub can just use the 'gh' prefix\n$ pipx run cookiecutter gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage\n```\n\n**Use a local template**\n\n```bash\n$ pipx run cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/\n```\n\n**Use it from Python**\n\n```py\nfrom cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter\n\n# Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template\ncookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')\n\n# Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template\ncookiecutter('gh:audreyfeldroy//cookiecutter-pypackage.git')\n```\n\n#### Detailed Usage\n\n- Generate projects from local or remote templates.\n- Customize projects with `cookiecutter.json` prompts.\n- Utilize pre-prompt, pre- and post-generate hooks.\n\n[Learn More](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)\n\n### For Template Creators\n\n- Utilize unlimited directory nesting.\n- Employ Jinja2 for all templating needs.\n- Define template variables easily with `cookiecutter.json`.\n\n[Learn More](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/)\n\n## Available Templates\n\nDiscover a variety of ready-to-use templates on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=cookiecutter&type=Repositories).\n\n### Special Templates\n\n- [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage)\n- [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django)\n- [cookiecutter-pytest-plugin](https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin)\n- [cookiecutter-plone-starter](https://github.com/collective/cookiecutter-plone-starter)\n\n## Community\n\nJoin the community, contribute, or seek assistance.\n\n- [Troubleshooting Guide](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html)\n- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cookiecutter)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/9BrxzPKuEW)\n- [File an Issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen)\n- [Contributors](AUTHORS.md)\n- [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### Support\n\n- Star us on [GitHub](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).\n- Stay tuned for upcoming support options.\n\n### Feedback\n\nWe value your feedback.
