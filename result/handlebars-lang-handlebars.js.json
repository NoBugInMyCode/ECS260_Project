In most cases it is possible to swap out Mustache with Handlebars and continue using your current templates.\n\nCheckout the official Handlebars docs site at\n[handlebarsjs.com](https://handlebarsjs.com) and try our [live demo](https://handlebarsjs.com/playground.html).\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nSee our [installation documentation](https://handlebarsjs.com/installation/).\n\nUsage\n-----\nIn general, the syntax of Handlebars.js templates is a superset\nof Mustache templates. For basic syntax, check out the [Mustache\nmanpage](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html).\n\nOnce you have a template, use the `Handlebars.compile` method to compile\nthe template into a function. The generated function takes a context\nargument, which will be used to render the template.\n\n```js\nvar source = \"<p>Hello, my name is {{name}}. I am from {{hometown}}. I have \" +\n             \"{{kids.length}} kids:</p>\" +\n             \"<ul>{{#kids}}<li>{{name}} is {{age}}</li>{{/kids}}</ul>\";\nvar template = Handlebars.compile(source);\n\nvar data = { \"name\": \"Alan\", \"hometown\": \"Somewhere, TX\",\n             \"kids\": [{\"name\": \"Jimmy\", \"age\": \"12\"}, {\"name\": \"Sally\", \"age\": \"4\"}]};\nvar result = template(data);\n\n// Would render:\n// <p>Hello, my name is Alan. I am from Somewhere, TX. I have 2 kids:</p>\n// <ul>\n//   <li>Jimmy is 12</li>\n//   <li>Sally is 4</li>\n// </ul>\n```\n\nFull documentation and more examples are at [handlebarsjs.com](https://handlebarsjs.com/).\n\nPrecompiling Templates\n----------------------\n\nHandlebars allows templates to be precompiled and included as javascript code rather than the handlebars template allowing for faster startup time. Full details are located [here](https://handlebarsjs.com/installation/precompilation.html).\n\nDifferences Between Handlebars.js and Mustache\n----------------------------------------------\nHandlebars.js adds a couple of additional features to make writing\ntemplates easier and also changes a tiny detail of how partials work.\n\n- [Nested Paths](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#path-expressions)\n- [Helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#helpers)\n- [Block Expressions](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/block-helpers.html#basic-blocks)\n- [Literal Values](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#literal-segments)\n- [Delimited Comments](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#template-comments)\n\nBlock expressions have the same syntax as mustache sections but should not be confused with one another. Sections are akin to an implicit `each` or `with` statement depending on the input data and helpers are explicit pieces of code that are free to implement whatever behavior they like. The [mustache spec](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) defines the exact behavior of sections. In the case of name conflicts, helpers are given priority.\n\n### Compatibility\n\nThere are a few Mustache behaviors that Handlebars does not implement.\n- Handlebars deviates from Mustache slightly in that it does not perform recursive lookup by default. The compile time `compat` flag must be set to enable this functionality. Users should note that there is a performance cost for enabling this flag. The exact cost varies by template, but it's recommended that performance sensitive operations should avoid this mode and instead opt for explicit path references.\n- The optional Mustache-style lambdas are not supported. Instead Handlebars provides its own lambda resolution that follows the behaviors of helpers.\n- Handlebars does not allow space between the opening `{{` and a command character such as `#`, `/` or `>`. The command character must immediately follow the braces, so for example `{{>\u00a0partial\u00a0}}` is allowed but `{{\u00a0>\u00a0partial\u00a0}}` is not.\n- Alternative delimiters are not supported.\n\n\nSupported Environments\n----------------------\n\nHandlebars has been designed to work in any ECMAScript 2020 environment. This includes\n\n- Node.js\n- Chrome\n- Firefox\n- Safari\n- Edge\n\nIf you need to support older environments, use Handlebars version 4.\n\n\nPerformance\n-----------\n\nIn a rough performance test, precompiled Handlebars.js templates (in\nthe original version of Handlebars.js) rendered in about half the\ntime of Mustache templates. It would be a shame if it were any other\nway, since they were precompiled, but the difference in architecture\ndoes have some big performance advantages. Justin Marney, a.k.a.\n[gotascii](http://github.com/gotascii), confirmed that with an\n[independent test](http://sorescode.com/2010/09/12/benchmarks.html). The\nrewritten Handlebars (current version) is faster than the old version,\nwith many performance tests being 5 to 7 times faster than the Mustache equivalent.\n\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n\nSee [release-notes.md](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md) for upgrade notes.\n\nIf you are using Handlebars in production, please regularly look for issues labeled\n[possibly breaking](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22possibly+breaking%22).\nIf this label is applied to an issue, it means that the requested change is probably not a breaking change,\nbut since Handlebars is widely in use by a lot of people, there's always a chance that it breaks somebody's build.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nSee [FAQ.md](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/FAQ.md) for known issues and common pitfalls.\n\n\nHandlebars in the Wild\n----------------------\n\n* [apiDoc](https://github.com/apidoc/apidoc) apiDoc uses handlebars as parsing engine for api documentation view generation.\n* [Assemble](https://assemble.io), by [@jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert) and [@doowb](https://github.com/doowb), is a static site generator that uses Handlebars.js as its template engine.\n* [CoSchedule](https://coschedule.com) An editorial calendar for WordPress that uses Handlebars.js.\n* [Ember.js](https://www.emberjs.com) makes Handlebars.js the primary way to structure your views, also with automatic data binding support.\n* [express-handlebars](https://github.com/express-handlebars/express-handlebars) A Handlebars view engine for Express which doesn't suck.\n* [express-hbs](https://github.com/TryGhost/express-hbs) Express Handlebars template engine with inheritance, partials, i18n and async helpers.\n* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) Just a blogging platform.\n* [handlebars-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/handlebars-action) A GitHub action to transform files in your repository with Handlebars templating.\n* [handlebars_assets](https://github.com/leshill/handlebars_assets) A Rails Asset Pipeline gem from Les Hill (@leshill).\n* [handlebars-helpers](https://github.com/assemble/handlebars-helpers) is an extensive library with 100+ handlebars helpers.\n* [handlebars-layouts](https://github.com/shannonmoeller/handlebars-layouts) is a set of helpers which implement extensible and embeddable layout blocks as seen in other popular templating languages.\n* [handlebars-loader](https://github.com/pcardune/handlebars-loader) A handlebars template loader for webpack.\n* [handlebars-wax](https://github.com/shannonmoeller/handlebars-wax) The missing Handlebars API.
