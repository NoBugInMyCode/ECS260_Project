It performs an **in-depth security scan** and runs on the system itself. The primary goal is to test security defenses and **provide tips for further system hardening**. It will also scan for general system information, vulnerable software packages, and possible configuration issues. Lynis was commonly used by system administrators and auditors to assess the security defenses of their systems. Besides the \"blue team,\" nowadays penetration testers also have Lynis in their toolkit.\n\nWe believe software should be **simple**, **updated on a regular basis**, and **open**. You should be able to trust, understand, and have the option to change the software. Many agree with us, as the software is being used by thousands every day to protect their systems.\n\n## Goals\n\nThe main goals are:\n- Automated security auditing\n- Compliance testing (e.g. ISO27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)\n- Vulnerability detection\n\nThe software (also) assists with:\n- Configuration and asset management\n- Software patch management\n- System hardening\n- Penetration testing (privilege escalation)\n- Intrusion detection\n\n### Audience\n\nTypical users of the software:\n- System administrators\n- Auditors\n- Security officers\n- Penetration testers\n- Security professionals\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are multiple options available to install Lynis.\n\n### Software Package\n\nFor systems running Linux, BSD, and macOS, there is typically a package available. This is the preferred method of obtaining Lynis, as it is quick to install and easy to update. The Lynis project itself also provides [packages](https://packages.cisofy.com/) in RPM or DEB format suitable for systems systems running:\n`CentOS`, `Debian`, `Fedora`, `OEL`, `openSUSE`, `RHEL`, `Ubuntu`, and others.\n\nSome distributions may also have Lynis in their software repository: [![Repology](https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/lynis.svg)](https://repology.org/project/lynis/versions)\n\nNote: Some distributions don't provide an up-to-date version. In that case it is better to use the CISOfy software repository, download the tarball from the website, or download the latest GitHub release.\n\n### Git\n\nThe very latest developments can be obtained via git.\n\n1. Clone or download the project files (**no compilation nor installation** is required) ;\n\n        git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis\n\n2. Execute:\n\n        cd lynis && ./lynis audit system\n\nIf you want to run the software as `root` (or sudo), we suggest changing the ownership of the files. Use `chown -R 0:0` to recursively alter the owner and group and set it to user ID `0` (`root`). Otherwise Lynis will warn you about the file permissions. After all, you are executing files owned by a non-privileged user.\n\n\n### Enterprise Version\n\nThis software component is also part of an enterprise solution. Same quality, yet with more functionality.\n\nFocus areas include compliance (`PCI DSS`, `HIPAA`, `ISO27001`, and others). The Enterprise version comes with:\n* a web interface;\n* dashboard and reporting;\n* hardening snippets;\n* improvement plan (based on risk);\n* commercial support.\n\n## Documentation\nFull documentation: https://cisofy.com/documentation/lynis/.\n\n## Customization\nIf you want to create your own tests, have a look at the [Lynis software development kit](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis-sdk).\n\n## Security\nWe participate in the [CII best practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/96) badge program of the Linux Foundation.\n\n## Media and Awards\nLynis is collecting some awards along the way and we are proud of that.\n\n* 2016\n  * [Best of Open Source Software Awards 2016](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3121251/open-source-tools/bossie-awards-2016-the-best-open-source-networking-and-security-software.html#slide13).\n  * Article by TechRepublic, considering Lynis a \"must-have\" tool: [How to quickly audit a Linux system from the command line](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-quickly-audit-a-linux-system-from-the-command-line/)\n  * [![ToolsWatch Best Tools (top 10)](https://www.toolswatch.org/badges/toptools/2016.svg)](https://www.toolswatch.org/2017/02/2016-top-security-tools-as-voted-by-toolswatch-org-readers/)\n\n* 2015\n  * [![ToolsWatch Best Tools (second place)](https://www.toolswatch.org/badges/toptools/2015.svg)](https://www.toolswatch.org/2016/02/2015-top-security-tools-as-voted-by-toolswatch-org-readers/)\n  * [Best of Open Source Software Awards 2015](http://www.idgenterprise.com/news/press-release/infoworld-announces-the-2015-best-of-open-source-software-awards/) ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/20210313082124/https://www.idg.com/news/infoworld-announces-the-2015-best-of-open-source-software-awards/)).\n\n* 2014\n  * [![ToolsWatch Best Tools (third place)](https://www.toolswatch.org/badges/toptools/2014.svg)](https://www.toolswatch.org/2015/01/2014-top-security-tools-as-voted-by-toolswatch-org-readers/)\n\n* 2013\n  * [![ToolsWatch Best Tools (sixth place)](https://www.toolswatch.org/badges/toptools/2013.svg)](https://www.toolswatch.org/2013/12/2013-top-security-tools-as-voted-by-toolswatch-org-readers/)\n\n## Contribute\n\n> We love contributors.\n\nDo you have something to share?
