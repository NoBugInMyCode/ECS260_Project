You are also welcome to make pull requests for changes to the configuration files.\n\n`languages.yml` determines which file extensions are considered part of the same language. (For example, identifiers from `.c` files will be suggested in `.h` files.)\n\n`language_tokenization.json` determines how languages are tokenized. For example, identifiers can contain dashes in Lisp, but not in Java.\n\nIf your feature request is specific to a particular editor's TabNine client, please file an issue in one of these repositories:\n\n- [VS Code](https://github.com/zxqfl/tabnine-vscode)\n- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/zxqfl/tabnine-sublime)\n- [Vim](https://github.com/zxqfl/tabnine-vim)\n- [Atom](https://github.com/zxqfl/tabnine-atom)\n\nYou may be interested in these TabNine clients written by **third parties**:\n\n> **_NOTE:_** Codota is **not** validating any code in those plugins and is not responsible for them by any means.\n- [Emacs](https://github.com/TommyX12/company-tabnine)\n- [Vim (Deoplete)](https://github.com/tbodt/deoplete-tabnine)\n- [Eclipse](https://github.com/GitPopcorn/tabnine-eclipse)\n- Your client https://github.com/codota/TabNine/blob/master/HowToWriteAClient.md\n\n# Supported Architectures\n- x86_64-unknown-linux-musl\n- x86_64-apple-darwin\n- aarch64-apple-darwin\n- i686-pc-windows-gnu\n- x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\n",
