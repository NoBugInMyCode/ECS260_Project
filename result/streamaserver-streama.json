We are more than happy to assist and then improve the docs accordingly. \n\n# Downloads\n- **Stable and beta** versions see the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/releases)\n\n# The Application\n\n### Settings\n![Streama Settings Validation](http://i.imgur.com/oEMXLPk.gif)\n\nWhen you first run the application, you will be redirected to the settings page. Here you enter your desired upload directory for the video files, your [theMovieDb.org API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and a different base URL if so desired (useful for remote hosting).\n\nOnce you made adjustments to any of the settings, make sure to validate the value before saving.\n- For the API-Key, the validation checks against theMovieDb.org to see if you've entered a valid API-key.\n- For the upload directory, the application checks if it has read/write permissions for it.\n\n### The Dashboard\n![Streama Dashboard](http://new.tinygrab.com/d9072ef564654c6e245c442e9c7d95facd4b738538.png)\n\nOn the dashboard, a user can see their recently watched TV-shows and Movies and their progress (they can continue where they left off) as well start new shows and movies that they haven't yet seen. The \"Continue Watching\" Feature works by periodically updating the database (only while watching, of course!) with info about the currently watched Video and how far it has been seen.\n\nIf a Movie or Episode does not contain any video-files, it won't show up in the dashboard.\n\n### The Player\n![Streama Player](http://new.tinygrab.com/d9072ef56407e5d1ac40fab040aedc398a9abb3609.png)\n\nThe Streama-Player is (heavily) inspired by Netflix, so you get all the good stuff from there. For Shows, there is a \"next episode\" button and a handy episode/season browser. There are also the basics: volume-control, play/pause, and fullscreen. \nLater down the road I will add a feature to add subtitles and switch between video-files (for instance for different quality uploads). \nThe player is HTML5-based and has only really been tested in Chrome so far.\n\n##### The Episode Browser\nI am especially proud of the Episode-Browser, which aims to function just like on Netflix. By default, the current video files season is selected. The user gets an overview of which other episodes there are in the season, how many seasons there are, and, as an added feature, the user sees all the added episodes, even if no video-files are added to them (thus greyed out).\n\n![Streama Episode Browser](http://i.imgur.com/MLE6TpH.gif)\n\n### The Admin-Panel\n![Streama Admin](http://new.tinygrab.com/d9072ef56484ebb444cc2fc7bc11f18e9f1706f68f.png)\n\nOne of the most important things to me was to make managing shows, movies, and episodes as easy and fun as possible. For this, I made heavy use of the API from [theMovieDatabase.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/), which auto-fills the episodes, shows and movies with useful information and great images. This eases the user's role in adding content.\n\nFor example, creating a new TV-show and the episodes for the first season looks something like this:\n\n![Streama Creating Show](http://i.imgur.com/TLptKdp.gif)\n\nUploading video-files for each episode is as easy as drag-and-drop!\n\n![Streama Uploading Episode](http://i.imgur.com/StgES0S.gif)  \n\n### Accessing existing files\nIf you want to avoid uploading every file, use our new and improved \"Local File\" Feature instead. You can define a local directory (I use one directly in which I created symlinks to all my mounted drives) and then you can either use the local file browser for individual movies / tv-Shows or you can use the bulk-create feature. \n\n#### The local file browser\nYou can access the local file browser from any movie or TV-show (anywhere where you would otherwise upload a file). Note: You need to first define the local directory in the settings.\n![Movie Detail](https://files.gitter.im/dularion/streama/2Al4/image.png)\n![Local File directory](https://files.gitter.im/dularion/streama/wY2h/image.png)\n\n#### Bulk-Create from File\nThis MR addresses the issue \"Batch Add Files #241\".\nNote: the TV-Show does not have to be present in order for this to work. Everything will be created by the backend. \n\n##### Running matcher & previewing the result\n![sep-02-2017 01-24-34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/936076/29990709-8f34e8f8-8f7d-11e7-9d9b-955236bf2251.gif)\n\n##### adding single matched file \n![sep-02-2017 01-24-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/936076/29990718-a28e2af4-8f7d-11e7-9821-eba309b04011.gif)\n\n##### adding files in bulk\n![sep-02-2017 01-24-26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/936076/29990720-aa6dcb08-8f7d-11e7-8f1c-59cdadee10d6.gif)\n\n\n##### Customizing the Matcher\nJust like in Emby or Kodi, the matcher-regex can be altered. The two defaults are \n**Movie**: `/^(?<Name>.*)[_.]\\(\\d{4}\\).*/`  \n**TvShow/Episode**: `/^(?<Name>.+)[._]S(?<Season>\\d{2})E(?<Episode>\\d{2,3}).*/`   \n\nIn order to customize the regex, just add the regex in the bottom of the application.yml like so:\n```yml\nstreama:\n  regex:\n    movies: ^(?<Name>.*)[_.]\\(\\d{4}\\).*\n    shows: ^(?<Name>.+)[._]S(?<Season>\\d{2})E(?<Episode>\\d{2,3}).*\n\n```\n\n\n### The Users\n![Streama User Management](http://new.tinygrab.com/d9072ef564717c22dde948c726144b1b707a607adc.png)\nUsers can be invited and managed in the admin panel. By default, they are non-admins, meaning they can only view videos, not create them. You can make them admins with the press of a button. Since there is user-administration in place, I plan on expanding on this a lot! Another feature I want to add is the ability for users to add and administer some form of playlists. There is a lot of potentials to make this even better!\n\n# Technical Details\nThis application is web-based, the server-side is written on [Grails 3](https://grails.org/) with [SpringSecurity](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/) for login & user-handling. For all the front-end components, [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is used and the player is completely HTML5-based. The application is essentially split into Grails for a REST-API, and AngularJS for the frontend.\n\nStreama uses the [awesome API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) from [theMovieDatabase](https://www.themoviedb.org) for all media-metadata.\n\n# Changelog\nPlease refer to the description of each [release](https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/releases) or the git log.\n\n# Roadmap\nStreama is still very much a work-in-progress. We will be adding new features and bug-fixes often, but this is a hobby project for the core-contributors, so the time that we can spend on it is limited.\n\nFor all our feature and bug tracking, we use the [Issues Section](https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/issues). Streama's 'roadmap' is currently to work through the feature requests and improvements that are in the issue tracker.  Take a look at the milestones for what we intend to add for upcoming releases.\n\n\n# Contributing\n### Features, Improvements, and Bugfixes\nStreama currently only has ~2-3 core-contributors so we are grateful for any extra contributions. Send through a Pull Request and we will review it ASAP.\n\nIf you're not sure what to work on, take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/issues). There are lots to do!\n\n### Translations\nIf you want to contribute a translation, please follow [the guide here](https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/wiki/Translating-the-app). \n\n# Known Issues\n- There is no video-conversion currently, meaning you are reliant upon HTML5 browser compatibilities. Server-side conversion is on our roadmap.
