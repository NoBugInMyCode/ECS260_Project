You can use this directly in your own applications, and it's used by many of the other components of Vert.x.\n\nFor more information on Vert.x and where Vert.x core fits into the big picture please see the [website](http://vertx.io).\n\n## Building Vert.x artifacts\n\n```\n> mvn package\n```\n\n## Running tests\n\nRuns the tests\n\n```\n> mvn test\n```\n\nTests can be run with specified HTTP port and/or HTTPS port.\n\n```\n> mvn test -Dvertx.httpPort=8888 -Dvertx.httpsPort=4044\n```\n\nVert.x supports native transport on BSD and Linux, to run the tests with native transport\n\n```\n> mvn test -PNativeEpoll\n> mvn test -PNativeIoUring\n> mvn test -PNativeKQueue\n```\n\nVert.x supports domain sockets on Linux exclusively, to run the tests with domain sockets\n\n```\n> mvn test -PNativeEpoll+DomainSockets\n```\n\nVert.x has integrations tests that run a differently configured JVM (classpath, system properties, etc....)\n\n```\n> vertx verify -Dtest=FooTest # FooTest does not exists, its only purpose is to execute no tests during the test phase\n```\n\n## Building documentation\n\n```\n> mvn package -Pdocs -DskipTests\n```\n\nOpen _target/docs/vertx-core/java/index.html_ with your browser\n\n\n",
