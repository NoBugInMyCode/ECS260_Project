Charts has now been renamed DGCharts to prevent conflicts with Apple's new Swift Charts. Please read [the release/migration notes](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/releases/tag/5.0.0).\n\n### One more heads up: As Swift evolves, if you are not using the latest Swift compiler, you shouldn't check out the master branch. Instead, you should go to the release page and pick up whatever suits you.\n\n- Xcode 14 / Swift 5.7 (master branch)\n- iOS >= 12.0 (Use as an **Embedded** Framework)\n- tvOS >= 12.0\n- macOS >= 10.13\n\nOkay so there's this beautiful library called [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) by [Philipp Jahoda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippjahoda) which has become very popular amongst Android developers, but there was no decent solution to create charts for iOS.\n\nI've chosen to write it in `Swift` as it can be highly optimized by the compiler, and can be used in both `Swift` and `ObjC` project. The demo project is written in `ObjC` to demonstrate how it works.\n\n**An amazing feature** of this library now, for Android, iOS, tvOS and macOS, is the time it saves you when developing for both platforms, as the learning curve is singleton- it happens only once, and the code stays very similar so developers don't have to go around and re-invent the app to produce the same output with a different library. (And that's not even considering the fact that there's not really another good choice out there currently...)\n\n## Having trouble running the demo?\n\n- `ChartsDemo/ChartsDemo.xcodeproj` is the demo project for iOS/tvOS\n- `ChartsDemo-OSX/ChartsDemo-OSX.xcodeproj` is the demo project for macOS\n- Make sure you are running a supported version of Xcode.\n  - Usually it is specified here a few lines above.\n  - In most cases it will be the latest Xcode version.\n- Make sure that your project supports Swift 5.0\n- Optional: Run `carthage checkout` in the project folder, to fetch dependencies (i.e testing dependencies).\n  - If you don't have Carthage - you can get it [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases).\n\n## Usage\n\nIn order to correctly compile:\n\n1. Drag the `DGCharts.xcodeproj` to your project\n2. Go to your target's settings, hit the \"+\" under the \"Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content\" section, and select the DGCharts.framework\n3. `@import DGCharts`\n4. When using Swift in an ObjC project:\n\n- You need to import your Bridging Header. Usually it is \"_YourProject-Swift.h_\", so in ChartsDemo it's \"_ChartsDemo-Swift.h_\". Do not try to actually include \"_ChartsDemo-Swift.h_\" in your project :-)\n- (Xcode 8.1 and earlier) Under \"Build Options\", mark \"Embedded Content Contains Swift Code\"\n- (Xcode 8.2+) Under \"Build Options\", mark \"Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries\"\n\n5. When using [Realm.io](https://realm.io/):\n   - Note that the Realm framework is not linked with Charts - it is only there for _optional_ bindings. Which means that you need to have the framework in your project, and in a compatible version to whatever is compiled with DGCharts. We will do our best to always compile against the latest version.\n   - You'll need to add `ChartsRealm` as a dependency too.\n\n## 3rd party tutorials\n\n#### Video tutorials\n\n- [Chart in Swift - Setting Up a Basic Line Chart Using iOS Charts(Alex Nagy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWhwe_tLNE8&list=PL_csAAO9PQ8bjzg-wxEff1Fr0Y5W1hrum&index=5)\n- [Charts Framework in SwiftUI - Bar Chart (Stewart Lynch)](https://youtu.be/csd7pyfEXgw)\n\n#### Blog posts\n\n- [Using Realm and Charts with Swift 3 in iOS 10 (Sami Korpela)](https://medium.com/@skoli/using-realm-and-charts-with-swift-3-in-ios-10-40c42e3838c0#.2gyymwfh8)\n- [Creating a Line Chart in Swift 3 and iOS 10 (Osian Smith)](https://medium.com/@OsianSmith/creating-a-line-chart-in-swift-3-and-ios-10-2f647c95392e)\n- [Beginning Set-up and Example Using Charts with Swift 3](https://github.com/annalizhaz/ChartsForSwiftBasic)\n- [Creating a Radar Chart in Swift (David Piper)](https://medium.com/@HeyDaveTheDev/creating-a-radar-chart-in-swift-5791afcf92f0)\n- [Plotting in IOS using Charts framework with SwiftUI (Evgeny Basisty)](https://medium.com/@zzzzbh/plotting-in-ios-using-charts-framework-with-swiftui-222034a2bea6)\n- [Set Up a Basic Bar Chart Using iOS-Charts (Penny Huang)](https://medium.com/@penny-huang/swift-setting-up-a-basic-bar-chart-using-ios-charts-afd6aad96ac)\n- [iOS-Charts Tutorial: Highlight Selected Value With a Custom Marker (Penny Huang)](https://medium.com/@penny-huang/swift-ios-charts-tutorial-highlight-selected-value-with-a-custom-marker-30ccbf92aa1b)\n- [Drawing Charts in iOS Before SwiftUI (Gennady Stepanov)](https://medium.com/better-programming/drawing-charts-in-ios-before-swiftui-9f95b8612607)\n\nWant your tutorial to show here? Create a PR!\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n#### Can't compile?\n\n- Please note the difference between installing a compiled framework from CocoaPods or Carthage, and copying the source code.\n- Please read the **Usage** section again.\n- Search in the issues\n- Try to politely ask in the issues section\n\n#### Other problems / feature requests\n\n- Search in the issues\n- Try to politely ask in the issues section\n\n## CocoaPods Install\n\nAdd `pod 'DGCharts'` to your Podfile. \"DGCharts\" is the name of the library.  \nFor [Realm](https://realm.io/) support, please add `pod 'ChartsRealm'` too.\n\n**Note:** ~~`pod 'ios-charts'`~~ is not the correct library, and refers to a different project by someone else.\n\n## Carthage Install\n\nDGCharts now include Carthage prebuilt binaries.\n\n```carthage\ngithub \"danielgindi/Charts\" == 5.1.0\ngithub \"danielgindi/Charts\" ~> 5.1.0\n```\n\nIn order to build the binaries for a new release, use `carthage build --no-skip-current && carthage archive Charts`.\n\n## Swift Package Manager Install\n\nSwift Package Manager\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"5.1.0\"))\n]\n```\n\n## 3rd party bindings\n\nXamarin (by @Flash3001): _iOS_ - [GitHub](https://github.com/Flash3001/iOSCharts.Xamarin)/[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/iOSCharts/). _Android_ - [GitHub](https://github.com/Flash3001/MPAndroidChart.Xamarin)/[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MPAndroidChart/).\n\n## Help\n\nIf you like what you see here, and want to support the work being done in this repository, you could:\n\n- Contribute code, issues and pull requests\n- Let people know this library exists (:fire: spread the word :fire:)\n- [![Donate](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=68UL6Y8KUPS96) (You can buy me a beer, or you can buy me dinner :-)\n\n**Note:** The author of [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) is the reason that this library exists, and is accepting [donations](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart#donations) on his page.
