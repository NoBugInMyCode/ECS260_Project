Extensive documentation\n  - Many example files available on [the Database](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Patterns)\n  - Achievements guiding you through the features of ImHex\n  - Interactive tutorials\n</details>\n\n## Pattern Language\n\nThe Pattern Language is the completely custom programming language developed for ImHex.\nIt allows you to define structures and data types in a C-like syntax and then use them to parse and highlight a file's content.\n\n- Source Code: [Link](https://github.com/WerWolv/PatternLanguage/)\n- Documentation: [Link](https://docs.werwolv.net/pattern-language/)\n\n## Database\n\nFor format patterns, libraries, magic and constant files, check out the [ImHex-Patterns](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Patterns) repository. \n\n**Feel free to PR your own files there as well!**\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo use ImHex, the following minimal system requirements need to be met.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> ImHex requires a GPU with OpenGL 3.0 support in general.\n> There are releases available (with the `-NoGPU` suffix) that are software rendered and don't require a GPU, however these can be a lot slower than the GPU accelerated versions.\n> \n> If possible at all, make ImHex use the dedicated GPU on your system instead of the integrated one.\n> ImHex will usually run fine with integrated GPUs as well but certain Intel HD GPU drivers on Windows are known to cause graphical artifacts.\n\n- **OS**: \n  - **Windows**: Windows 7 or higher (Windows 10/11 recommended)\n  - **macOS**: macOS 13 (Ventura) or higher, \n    - Lower versions should still work too, but you'll need to compile ImHex yourself. The release binaries will NOT work.\n    - The macOS build is not signed and will require you to manually allow them in the Security & Privacy settings.\n  - **Linux**: \"Modern\" Linux. The following distributions have official releases available. Other distros are supported through the AppImage and Flatpak releases.\n    - Ubuntu and Debian\n    - Fedora\n    - RHEL/AlmaLinux\n    - Arch Linux\n    - Basically any other distro will work as well when compiling ImHex from sources.\n- **CPU**: Officially supported are x86_64 and ARM64, though any Little Endian 64 bit CPU should work.\n- **GPU**: OpenGL 3.0 or higher \n  - Integrated Intel HD iGPUs are supported, however certain drivers are known to cause various graphical artifacts, especially on Windows. Use at your own risk.\n  - In case you don't have a GPU available, there are software rendered releases available for Windows and macOS\n- **RAM**: ~150MiB, more is required for more complex analysis\n- **Storage**: 150MiB\n\n## Installing\n\nInformation on how to install ImHex can be found in the [Install](/INSTALL.md) guide\n\n## Compiling\n\nTo compile ImHex on any platform, GCC (or Clang) is required with a version that supports C++23 or higher. \nWindows and Linux releases are being built using latest available GCC.\nMacOS releases are being built using latest available LLVM Clang.\n\nImportant to note is, the MSVC and AppleClang compilers are both **NOT** supported since they're both generally severely outdated and lack features GCC and LLVM Clang have.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Many dependencies are bundled into the repository using submodules so make sure to clone it using the `--recurse-submodules` option.\n> All dependencies that aren't bundled, can be installed using the dependency installer scripts found in the `/dist` folder.\n\nFor more information, check out the [Compiling](/dist/compiling) guide.\n\n## Contributing\nSee [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Plugin development\n\nTo develop plugins for ImHex, use the following template project to get started. You then have access to the entirety of libimhex as well as the ImHex API and the Content Registry to interact with ImHex or to add new content.\n- [ImHex Plugin Template](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Plugin-Template)\n\n\n## Credits\n\n### Contributors\n\n- [iTrooz](https://github.com/iTrooz) for getting ImHex onto the Web as well as hundreds of contributions in every part of the project\n- [jumanji144](https://github.com/jumanji144) for huge contributions to the Pattern Language and ImHex's infrastructure\n- [Mary](https://github.com/marysaka) for her immense help porting ImHex to MacOS and help during development\n- [Roblabla](https://github.com/Roblabla) for adding MSI Installer support to ImHex\n- [Mailaender](https://github.com/Mailaender) for getting ImHex onto Flathub\n- Everybody else who has reported issues on Discord or GitHub that I had great conversations with :)\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Thanks a lot to ocornut for their amazing [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) which is used for building the entire interface\n  - Thanks to epezent for [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) used to plot data in various places\n  - Thanks to Nelarius for [ImNodes](https://github.com/Nelarius/imnodes) used as base for the data processor \n  - Thanks to BalazsJako for [ImGuiColorTextEdit](https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit) used for the pattern language syntax highlighting\n- Thanks to nlohmann for their [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) library used for configuration files\n- Thanks to vitaut for their [libfmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library which makes formatting and logging so much better\n- Thanks to btzy for [nativefiledialog-extended](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended) and their great support, used for handling file dialogs on all platforms\n- Thanks to danyspin97 for [xdgpp](https://sr.ht/~danyspin97/xdgpp) used to handle folder paths on Linux\n- Thanks to aquynh for [capstone](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone) which is the base of the disassembly window\n- Thanks to rxi for [microtar](https://github.com/rxi/microtar) used for extracting downloaded store assets \n- Thanks to VirusTotal for [Yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) used by the Yara plugin\n- Thanks to Martinsos for [edlib](https://github.com/Martinsos/edlib) used for sequence searching in the diffing view\n- Thanks to ron4fun for [HashLibPlus](https://github.com/ron4fun/HashLibPlus) which implements every hashing algorithm under the sun\n- Thanks to mackron for [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) used to play audio files\n- Thanks to all other groups and organizations whose libraries are used in ImHex\n\n### License\n\nThe biggest part of ImHex is under the GPLv2-only license. \nNotable exceptions to this are the following parts which are under the LGPLv2.1 license:\n- **/lib/libimhex**: The library that allows Plugins to interact with ImHex.\n- **/plugins/ui**: The UI plugin library that contains some common UI elements that can be used by other plugins\n\nThe reason for this is to allow for proprietary plugins to be developed for ImHex.\n",
