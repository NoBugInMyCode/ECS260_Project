        "readme": "# The Rust Programming Language\n\n![Build Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n\nThis repository contains the source of \"The Rust Programming Language\" book.\n\n[The book is available in dead-tree form from No Starch Press][nostarch].\n\n[nostarch]: https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition\n\nYou can also read the book for free online. Please see the book as shipped with\nthe latest [stable], [beta], or [nightly] Rust releases. Be aware that issues\nin those versions may have been fixed in this repository already, as those\nreleases are updated less frequently.\n\n[stable]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/\n[beta]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/\n[nightly]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/\n\nSee the [releases] to download just the code of all the code listings that appear in the book.\n\n[releases]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/releases\n\n## Requirements\n\nBuilding the book requires [mdBook], ideally the same version that\nrust-lang/rust uses in [this file][rust-mdbook]. To get it:\n\n[mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook\n[rust-mdbook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/rustbook/Cargo.toml\n\n```bash\n$ cargo install mdbook --locked --version <version_num>\n```\n\nThe book also uses two mdbook plugins which are part of this repository. If you\ndo not install them, you will see warnings when building and the output will not\nlook right, but you _will_ still be able to build the book. To use the plugins,\nyou should run:\n\n```bash\n$ cargo install --locked --path packages/mdbook-trpl\n```\n\n## Building\n\nTo build the book, type:\n\n```bash\n$ mdbook build\n```\n\nThe output will be in the `book` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in\nyour web browser.\n\n_Firefox:_\n\n```bash\n$ firefox book/index.html                       # Linux\n$ open -a \"Firefox\" book/index.html             # OS X\n$ Start-Process \"firefox.exe\" .\\book\\index.html # Windows (PowerShell)\n$ start firefox.exe .\\book\\index.html           # Windows (Cmd)\n```\n\n_Chrome:_\n\n```bash\n$ google-chrome book/index.html                 # Linux\n$ open -a \"Google Chrome\" book/index.html       # OS X\n$ Start-Process \"chrome.exe\" .\\book\\index.html  # Windows (PowerShell)\n$ start chrome.exe .\\book\\index.html            # Windows (Cmd)\n```\n\nTo run the tests:\n\n```bash\n$ cd packages/trpl\n$ mdbook test --library-path packages/trpl/target/debug/deps\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe'd love your help! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] to learn about the\nkinds of contributions we're looking for.\n\n[contrib]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nBecause the book is [printed][nostarch], and because we want\nto keep the online version of the book close to the print version when\npossible, it may take longer than you're used to for us to address your issue\nor pull request.\n\nSo far, we've been doing a larger revision to coincide with [Rust Editions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/). Between those larger\nrevisions, we will only be correcting errors. If your issue or pull request\nisn't strictly fixing an error, it might sit until the next time that we're\nworking on a large revision: expect on the order of months or years. Thank you\nfor your patience!\n\n### Translations\n\nWe'd love help translating the book! See the [Translations] label to join in\nefforts that are currently in progress. Open a new issue to start working on\na new language! We're waiting on [mdbook support] for multiple languages\nbefore we merge any in, but feel free to start!\n\n[Translations]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATranslations\n[mdbook support]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/5\n\n## Spellchecking\n\nTo scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the `spellcheck.sh`\nscript available in the `ci` directory. It needs a dictionary of valid words,\nwhich is provided in `ci/dictionary.txt`. If the script produces a false\npositive (say, you used the word `BTreeMap` which the script considers invalid),\nyou need to add this word to `ci/dictionary.txt` (keep the sorted order for\nconsistency).\n",
