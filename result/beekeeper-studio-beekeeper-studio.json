Buying Beekeeper Studio is also the best way to support the community edition. [Download link](https://beekeeperstudio.io/get)\n\n2. **Beekeeper Studio Community Edition** - This repository. This is the open source version of Beekeeper Studio. It is a full featured database management client that is totally free and open source. [Download Link](https://beekeeperstudio.io/get-community)\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 [Compare Beekeeper Studio Editions](https://beekeeperstudio.io/get)\n\n\n## Beekeeper Studio Features\n\nTop feature: It's smooth \ud83c\udf6b, fast \ud83c\udfce, and you'll actually enjoy using it \ud83e\udd70\n\n- Truly cross-platform: Windows, MacOS, and Linux\n- Autocomplete SQL query editor with syntax highlighting\n- Tabbed interface, so you can multitask\n- Sort and filter table data to find just what you need\n- Sensible keyboard-shortcuts\n- Save queries for later\n- Query run-history, so you can find that one query you got working 3 days ago\n- Default dark theme\n\nFeatures exclusive to the full commercial edition ([available on our website](https://beekeeperstudio.io/get)):\n\n- More themes\n- Online storage for queries and connections with [Workspaces](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/features/workspace)\n- Easy data formatting with [Query magics](https://docs.beekeeperstudio.io/docs/query-magics)\n- Multi-table export (v4+)\n- Easy database backup using native tools (v4+)\n- Easy database restore using native tools (coming soon)\n- Oracle Database support\n- Cassandra database support\n\nOne of our frustrations with other open-source SQL editors and database managers is that they take a 'kitchen sink' approach to features, adding so many features that the UI becomes cluttered and hard to navigate. We wanted a good looking, open source SQL workbench that's powerful, but also easy to use. We couldn't find one, so we created Beekeeper Studio!\n\n\n## Supporting Beekeeper Studio\n\nI love working on Beekeeper Studio, and I'd love to keep growing and improving it forever. To do that I need your help.\n\nThe best way to support Beekeeper Studio is to purchase the [Ultimate Edition](https://beekeeperstudio.io/get). Every purchase directly supports my work on Beekeeper Studio.\n\nIf you can't afford a license, please consider [becoming a project sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/beekeeper-studio).\n\nThank you for your continued support!\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nCheck out [docs.beekeeperstudio.io](https://docs.beekeeperstudio.io) for user guides, FAQs, troubleshooting tips, and more.\n\n## License\n\nBeekeeper Studio Community Edition (the code in this repository) is licensed under the GPLv3 license.\n\nBeekeeper Studio Ultimate Edition contains extra features and is licensed under a [commercial end user agreement (EULA)](https://beekeeperstudio.io/legal/commercial-eula/).\n\nBeekeeper Studio's trademarks (words marks and logos) are not open source. See our [trademark guidelines](https://beekeeperstudio.io/legal/trademark/) for more information.\n\n## Trademark Guidelines\n\nTrademarks can be complicated with open source projects, so we have adapted a set of standard guidelines for using our trademarks that are common to many open source projects.\n\nIf you are just using the Beekeeper Studio app, and you are not forking or distributing Beekeeper Studio code in any way, these probably don't apply to you.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 [Beekeeper Studio Trademark Guidelines](https://beekeeperstudio.io/legal/trademark/)\n\n## Contributing to Beekeeper Studio\n\nWe love *any* community engagement. Even if you're complaining because you don't like something about the app!\n\n\n### Contributor Agreements\n\n- Building an inclusive and welcoming community is important to us, so please follow our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) as you engage with the project.\n\n- By contributing to the project you agree to the terms of our [contributor guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Contribute without coding\n\nWe have you covered, read our [guide to contributing in 10 minutes without coding](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio/issues/287).\n\n### Compiling and Running Beekeeper Studio Locally\n\nWant to write some code and improve Beekeeper Studio? Getting set-up is easy on Mac, Linux, or Windows.\n\n```bash\n# First: Install NodeJS 20, NPM, and Yarn\n# ...\n\n# 1. Fork the Beekeeper Studio Repo (click fork button at top right of this screen)\n# 2. Check out your fork:\ngit clone git@github.com:<your-username>/beekeeper-studio.git beekeeper-studio\ncd beekeeper-studio/\nyarn install # installs dependencies\n\n\n# Now you can start the app:\nyarn run electron:serve ## the app will now start\n```\n\n**If you get `error:03000086:digital envelope routines::initialization error`, you'll have to update openssl.**\n\n- On Ubuntu/Debian:\n```\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade openssl\n```\n\n- On CentOS/RHEL:\n```\nsudo yum update openssl\n```\n\n- On macOS (using Homebrew):\n```\nbrew update\nbrew upgrade openssl\n```\n\n### Where to make changes?\n\nThis repo is now a monorepo, we have several places with code, but only really a couple of important entry points.\n\nAll app code lives in `apps/studio`, some shared code lives in `shared/src`. This is shared with other apps.\n\nBeekeeper Studio has two entry points:\n- `background.js` - this is the electron-side code that controls native things like showing windows.\n- `main.js` - this is the entry point for the Vue.js app. You can follow the Vue component breadcrumbs from `App.vue` to find the screen you need.\n\n**Generally we have two 'screens':**\n- ConnectionInterface - connecting to a DB\n- CoreInterface - interacting with a database\n\n### How to submit a change?\n\n\n- Push your changes to your repository and open a Pull Request from our github page (this page)\n- Make sure to write some notes about what your change does! A gif is always welcome for visual changes.\n\n## Maintainer notes (casual readers can ignore this stuff)\n\n### Upgrading Electron Gotchas\n\nThis is always a total pain and will break the build 9/10.\n\nSome things you need to consider when upgrading Electron:\n\n1. Does it use a different node version. Eg Electron-18 uses node 14, 22 uses node 16. So everyone needs to upgrade\n2. Does node-abi need to be upgraded to be able to understand the electron version? This is used in the build to fetch prebuilt packages. You need to upgrade this in root/package.json#resolutions\n3. Were any APIs deprecated or removed? Make sure all features that interact with the Electron APIs still work, stuff like - selecting a file, maximizing a window, running a query, etc.\n\n\n### Release Process\n\n1. Up the version number in package.json\n2. Replace `build/release-notes.md` with the latest release notes. Follow the format that is there.\n  - run `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline | grep 'Merge pull'` to find PRs merged\n2. Commit\n3. Push to master\n4. Create a tag `git tag v<version>`. It must start with a 'v'\n5. `git push origin <tagname>`\n  - Now wait for the build/publish action to complete on Github\n6. Push the new release live\n  - Go to the new 'draft' release on the releases tab of github, edit the notes, publish\n  - Log into snapcraft.io, drag the uploaded release into the 'stable' channel for each architecture.\n\nThis should also publish the latest docs\n\nPost Release:\n1. Copy release notes to a blog post, post on website\n2. Tweet link\n3. Share on LinkedIn\n4. Send to mailing list on SendInBlue\n\n\n## Big Thanks\n\nBeekeeper Studio wouldn't exist without [Sqlectron-core](https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core), the core database libraries from the [Sqlectron project](https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui). Beekeeper Studio started as an experimental fork of that repository. A big thanks to @maxcnunes and the rest of the Sqlectron community.\n\nThe original license from sqlectron-core is included here:\n\n```\nCopyright (c) 2015 The SQLECTRON Team\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n```\n",
