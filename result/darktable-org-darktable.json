It is intended for testing and is generally not safe. See the notes [below](#get-the-source) for warnings and precautions about using the master branch.\n\n* [Install native packages directly or add third party repository for some Linux distros](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=graphics:darktable:master&package=darktable) (one snapshot per day)\n* [Binary packages are provided for Linux (AppImage), macOS and Windows on a nightly basis](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/nightly)\n\nUpdating from older versions\n----------------------------\n\nWhen updating darktable from an older release, you only need to install\nthe newest version. Existing files will be preserved.\n\nHowever, newer releases occasionally need to change the structure of the library database\n(containing the whole list of images known to darktable, with their editing history). If this happens\nyou will be prompted with a request to either upgrade the database or close the software.\n\n**Migration to a newer database structure/newer release means that your edits (both new and old)\nwill no longer be compatible with older versions of darktable.** Upgrades are definitive.\nNewer versions are always compatible with older edits, but newer edits are generally\nnot compatible with older versions.\n\ndarktable automatically backs up the library database when a new version causes it to be upgraded\n(in `~/.config/darktable/library.db-pre-3.0.0` for example), so\nyou can revert to the previous release by restoring this backup if needed\n(simply rename it to `library.db`).\n\nYou will not be able to open the newer version of the database with a version of darktable\nthat only supports the older version of the database. This is impossible because the older\napplication does not know how the database schema has changed, so its code will not be able\nto work with it.\n\nYou will be able to import images with an XMP sidecar file that contains newer versions of processing\nmodules or new modules, but those image editing parts will be discarded and you will lose them.\n\nIf you plan to move regularly between two versions (new/unstable and old/stable) see [below](#testunstable-version)\nfor details of how to do it safely.\n\nObtaining extensions\n--------------------\n\nExtensions and plugins use the Lua scripting language and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/darktable-org/lua-scripts). Lua support is optional in darktable, so make sure you have the `lua` interpreter and its development files (package\n`lua-dev` or `lua-devel`, depending on distributions) installed on your system\nwhile building or ensure the package you are using has been built with this library.\n\nExtensions allow exporting for various media and websites, merge/stack/blend HDR, panoramas or focus bracketing,\napply AI-based facial recognition, manage tags and GPS data, etc.\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\n### Dependencies\n\nCompatible compilers/toolchains:\n* Clang: 15 and later\n* GCC: 12 and later\n* MinGW-w64: 10 and later\n* XCode: 15.2 and later\n\nRequired dependencies (minimum version):\n* CMake 3.18\n* GTK 3.24.15\n* GLib 2.56\n* SQLite 3.26\n* libcurl 7.56\n* libpng 1.5.0 *(for PNG import & export, also for reading LUT files in PNG format)*\n* Exiv2 0.27.2 *(but at least 0.27.4 built with ISO BMFF support needed for Canon CR3 raw import)*\n* pugixml 1.5\n\nRequired dependencies (no version requirement):\n* Lensfun *(for automatic lens correction)* (Note: alpha 0.3.95 and git master branch are not supported)\n* LibTIFF *(for TIFF import & export)*\n* Little CMS 2\n\nOptional dependencies (minimum version):\n* OpenMP 4.5 *(for CPU multi-threading and SIMD vectorization)*\n* LLVM 7 *(for OpenCL checks at compilation time)*\n* OpenCL 1.2 *(for GPU-accelerated computing)*\n* Lua 5.4 *(for plugins and extension scripting)*\n* G'MIC 2.7.0 *(for .gmz compressed LUT files support)*\n* libgphoto2 2.5 *(for camera tethering)*\n* Imath 3.1.0 *(for 16-bit \"half\" float TIFF export and faster import)*\n* libavif 0.9.3 *(for AVIF import & export)*\n* libheif 1.13.0 *(for HEIF/HEIC/HIF import; also for AVIF import if no libavif)*\n* libjxl 0.7.0 *(for JPEG XL import & export)*\n* WebP 0.3.0 *(for WebP import & export)*\n\nOptional dependencies (no version requirement):\n* colord, Xatom *(for fetching the system display color profile)*\n* PortMidi *(for MIDI input support)*\n* SDL2 *(for gamepad input support)*\n* CUPS *(for print mode support)*\n* OpenEXR *(for EXR import & export)*\n* OpenJPEG *(for JPEG 2000 import & export)*\n* GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick *(for misc image format import)*\n\nTo install all the dependencies on Linux systems, you may use the source repositories of your distribution\n(provided they are up-to-date):\n\n#### Fedora and RHEL/CentOS\n\n```bash\nsudo dnf builddep darktable\n```\n\n#### OpenSuse\n\n```bash\nsudo zypper si -d darktable\n```\n\n#### Ubuntu\n\n```bash\nsed -e '/^#\\sdeb-src /s/^# *//;t;d' \"/etc/apt/sources.list\" \\\n  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/darktable-sources-tmp.list > /dev/null \\\n  && (\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get build-dep darktable\n  )\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/darktable-sources-tmp.list\n```\n\n#### Debian\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get build-dep darktable\n```\n\n#### Install missing dependencies\n\nIf mandatory dependencies are missing on your system, the software build will fail with\nerrors like `Package XXX has not been found` or `Command YYY has no provider on this system`.\nIf you see one of these errors you should find out which package provides the missing package/command in your distribution,\nthen install it. This can usually be done in your package manager (not the application manager\ncustomarily provided by default in your distribution) or from the internet with a search engine.\nYou may need to install a package manager first (like APT on Debian/Ubuntu, or DNF on Fedora/RHEL).\n\nThis process might be tedious but you only need to do it once. See\n[this page on building darktable](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/wiki/Building-darktable)\nfor one-line commands that will install most dependencies on the most common Linux distributions.\n\n### Get the source\n\n#### Master branch (unstable)\n\nThe master branch contains the latest version of the source code and is intended:\n* as a working base for developers,\n* for beta-testers to chase bugs,\n* for users willing to sacrifice stability for new features without waiting for the next release.\n\nThe master branch comes with no guarantee of stability and might corrupt your database and XMP files,\nresult in loss of data and edit history or temporarily break compatibility with previous versions and commits.\n\nHow dangerous is it? Most of the time, it is fairly stable. As with any rolling-release kind of deployment, bugs appear more often\nbut are fixed faster too. Sometimes, though, these bugs can result in losses or inconsistencies in the editing history of your pictures.\nThis is fine if you don't need to open your edits again in the future, but maybe not if you manage an estate.\n\nAfter backing up your `~/.config/darktable` directory and the sidecar .XMP files of any pictures you intend to open\nwith the master branch, you may obtain the source as follows:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable.git\ncd darktable\n```\n\nSee below (in \"Using\") how to start a test install of the unstable version without damaging your regular stable install and files.\n\n#### Latest stable release\n\n5.0.0\n\nThe darktable project releases two major versions every year, on Summer and Winter Solstices, tagged with even numbers (e.g. 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8).\nMinor revisions are tagged with a third digit (e.g. 4.4.1, 4.4.2) and mostly provide bug fixes and camera support.\nYou may want to compile these stable releases yourself to get better performance for your particular computer:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable.git\ncd darktable\ngit fetch --tags\ngit checkout tags/release-5.0.0\n```\n\n### Get submodules\n\nNote that [libxcf](https://github.com/houz/libxcf.git), [OpenCL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Headers.git), [RawSpeed](https://github.com/darktable-org/rawspeed), [whereami](https://github.com/gpakosz/whereami) and [LibRaw](https://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw) are tracked via git submodules, so after checking-out darktable, you need to update/checkout the submodules too:\n\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\n### Compile\n\n#### Easy way\n\nWARNING: If you have previously built darktable, don't forget to first completely remove (`rm -R`) the `build`\nand `/opt/darktable` directories to avoid conflicting files from different versions. Many weird behaviors and transient\nbugs have been reported that can be traced to the build cache not properly invalidating the changed dependencies, so\nthe safest way is to completely remove previously built binaries and start again from scratch.\n\ndarktable provides a shell script that automatically takes care of building on Linux and macOS for classic cases in a single command.\n\n```bash\n./build.sh --prefix /opt/darktable --build-type Release --install --sudo\n```\n\nIf you want to install a test version alongside your regular/stable version, change the install prefix:\n\n```bash\n./build.sh --prefix /opt/darktable-test --build-type Release --install --sudo\n```\n\nThis builds the software for your architecture only, with:\n\n* `-O3` optimization level,\n* SSE/AVX support if detected,\n* OpenMP support (multi-threading and vectorization) if detected,\n* OpenCL support (GPU offloading) if detected,\n* Lua scripting support if detected.\n\nIf you want to have dartkable displayed along your other applications, you only need to add a symbolic link:\n\n```bash\nln -s /opt/darktable/share/applications/org.darktable.darktable.desktop /usr/share/applications/org.darktable.darktable.desktop\n```\n\nNow, your custom-built darktable is ready to be used just like any pre-packaged software.\n\n#### Manual way\n\nAlternatively, you can use a manual build to pass custom arguments.\n\n##### Linux\n\n```bash\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/darktable/ ..\ncmake --build .\nsudo cmake --install .\n```\n\n##### macOS\n\nSee [Homebrew](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/master/packaging/macosx/BUILD_hb.txt) or [MacPorts](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/master/packaging/macosx/BUILD.txt) instructions.\n\n##### Windows\n\nSee [these instructions](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/tree/master/packaging/windows).\n\n### Using\n\n#### Test/unstable version\n\nTo use a test version of darktable without damaging your regular/stable version's files and database, start darktable in a terminal with:\n\n```bash\n/opt/darktable-test/bin/darktable --configdir \"~/.config/darktable-test\"\n```\n\nand ensure that you set the option \"create XMP files\" to \"never\" in preferences -> storage -> XMP sidecar files. This way,\nyour regular/stable version will save its configuration files in `~/.config/darktable`, as usual,\nthe test/unstable one will save in `~/.config/darktable-test`, and the two versions will not produce database conflicts.\n\n#### Regular/stable version\n\nSimply launch it from your desktop application menu or, from a terminal, run `darktable` or `/opt/darktable/bin/darktable`. If the installation did not create a launcher in your applications menu, run:\n\n```bash\nsudo ln -s /opt/darktable/share/applications/org.darktable.darktable.desktop /usr/share/applications/org.darktable.darktable.desktop\n```\n\nYou may find darktable configuration files in `~/.config/darktable`.\nIf you experience crashes at startup, try launching darktable from a terminal with OpenCL disabled using `darktable --disable-opencl`.\n\n### Further reading\n\nThere is a comprehensive list of build instructions for [Ubuntu/Debian related distributions](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/wiki/Build-instructions-for-Ubuntu) or for [Fedora and related distributions](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/wiki/Build-Instructions-for-Fedora). These build instructions can be easily adapted to many other Linux distributions.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nThere are many ways you can contribute to the darktable project:\n\n* Write a blog about darktable\n* Create a tutorial for darktable\n* Help expand the [user wiki](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/wiki) or [user manual](https://github.com/darktable-org/dtdocs)\n* Answer questions on the [user Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#darktable-user:matrix.org) or the [pixls.us forum](https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/darktable/19)\n* Share your ideas on the [developer Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#darktable-dev:matrix.org)\n* Test [releases](https://www.darktable.org/install/)\n* Review [pull requests](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pulls)\n* Start [hacking on darktable](https://www.darktable.org/development/) and see [developer's guide](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/wiki/Developer's-guide)\n\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### Why is my camera not detected when plugged-in ?\n\nCheck that you have the latest [gphoto2 library](http://www.gphoto.org/ \"gphoto2 homepage\") installed in order to support the newest cameras.\n\n### Why is my lens not detected/corrected in darkroom ?\n\nLens correction profiles are provided by Lensfun, which has 2 parts: a program and a database.\nMost Linux distributions provide a recent enough version of the program,\nbut provide an outdated version of the database. If\n[Lensfun](https://lensfun.github.io/) is correctly installed, then update its database in a terminal by running:\n\n```bash\nlensfun-update-data\n```\n\nor alternatively\n\n```bash\n/usr/bin/g-lensfun-update-data\n```\n\n### Why do the thumbnails in the lighttable view look different to the preview in the darkroom view ?\n\nFor RAW files that have never been edited in darktable (when you have just imported them), the lighttable view, by default, shows\nthe JPEG preview placed into the RAW file by your camera. Loading this JPEG file is faster and makes the\nlighttable view more responsive when importing large collections of images.\n\nHowever, this JPEG thumbnail is processed by the firmware of the camera, with proprietary algorithms,\nand colors, sharpness and contrast that might not look the same as\ndarktable processing (which is what you see when opening the image in the darkroom view).\nCamera manufacturers don't publish details of the pixel processing they perform in their firmware\nso their look is not exactly or easily reproducible by other software.\n\nHowever, once RAW images have been edited in darktable,\nthe lighttable thumbnail should exactly match the darkroom preview, as they are processed in the same way.\n\nIf you never want to see the embedded JPEG thumbnail in the lighttable view, for RAW files, you should set the\noption \"use raw file instead of embedded JPEG from size\" to \"never\" in preferences -> lighttable.\n\nWiki\n----\n\n* [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/wiki \"github wiki\")\n* [Developer wiki](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/wiki/Developer's-guide \"darktable developer wiki\")\n\n\nCommunity\n---------\n\n* [Darktable forum on pixls.us](https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/darktable/19)\n* [Darktable on Mastodon](https://photog.social/@darktable)\n",
