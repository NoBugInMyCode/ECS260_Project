For more information, see the\n[main Xenia wiki](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/wiki).\n\n**Interested in supporting the core contributors?** Visit\n[Xenia Project on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/xenia_project).\n\nCome chat with us about **emulator-related topics** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q9mxZf9).\nFor developer chat join `#dev` but stay on topic. Lurking is not only fine, but encouraged!\nPlease check the [FAQ](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/wiki/FAQ) page before asking questions.\nWe've got jobs/lives/etc, so don't expect instant answers.\n\nDiscussing illegal activities will get you banned.\n\n## Status\n\nBuildbot | Status | Releases\n-------- | ------ | --------\n[Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/benvanik/xenia/branch/master) | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ftqiy86kdfawyx3a/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/benvanik/xenia/branch/master) | [Latest](https://github.com/xenia-project/release-builds-windows/releases/latest) \u25e6 [All](https://github.com/xenia-project/release-builds-windows/releases)\n[Linux](https://cloud.drone.io/xenia-project/xenia) | [![Build status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/xenia-project/xenia/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/xenia-project/xenia)\n\nQuite a few real games run. Quite a few don't.\nSee the [Game compatibility list](https://github.com/xenia-project/game-compatibility/issues)\nfor currently tracked games, and feel free to contribute your own updates,\nscreenshots, and information there following the [existing conventions](https://github.com/xenia-project/game-compatibility/blob/master/README.md).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic\nof emulation of modern devices and operating systems. **It is not for enabling\nillegal activity**. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of\nlegally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet\n(you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...).\n\n## Quickstart\n\nSee the [Quickstart](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/wiki/Quickstart) page.\n\n## Building\n\nSee [building.md](docs/building.md) for setup and information about the\n`xb` script. When writing code, check the [style guide](docs/style_guide.md)\nand be sure to run clang-format!\n\n## Contributors Wanted!\n\nHave some spare time, know advanced C++, and want to write an emulator?\nContribute! There's a ton of work that needs to be done, a lot of which\nis wide open greenfield fun.\n\n**For general rules and guidelines please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\n\nFixes and optimizations are always welcome (please!), but in addition to\nthat there are some major work areas still untouched:\n\n* Help work through [missing functionality/bugs in games](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/compat)\n* Reduce the size of Xenia's [huge log files](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/issues/1526)\n* Skilled with Linux? A strong contributor is needed to [help with porting](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/platform-linux)\n\nSee more projects [good for contributors](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/good%20first%20issue).
