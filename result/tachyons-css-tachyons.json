This can be useful if you are using another library or have written some of your own CSS and want to make sure there are no naming collisions. To do this run the command:\n\n```npm run mutations```\n\n## Docs\n\nThe tachyons docs located at http://tachyons.io are all open source and located at https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons-css.github.io\n\nYou can clone the docs and use them as a template for documenting your own design system / patterns / components.\nWhile not everything is automated, the component library generation makes it extremely easy to\ngenerate and organize the documentation for components as demonstrated at http://tachyons.io/components\n\n### Community Resources\n\n- [DWYL Learn Tachyons](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tachyons): Learn how to use Tachyons to craft beautiful, responsive, functional and fast UI with minimal CSS\n- [Tachyons TLDR](https://tachyons-tldr.now.sh/#/classes): Quick lookup for Tachyons classes, scales and color palette\n- [Tachyons Pro](https://tachyonspro.netlify.app/): Fun quiz for memorizing class names\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) for contributors.\n\n## Tachyons in Production\n\nA longer list of sites that use tachyons in production can be found in sites.md\nWe love letting the community see what people are building. Please add your link to sites.md in a PR or by opening an issue if you're willing to share to your site or project.\n\n**Featured Sites**\n\n* https://interfacelovers.com\n* https://npmjs.com\n* https://womenwho.design\n* https://friendstalkfrontend.com\n* https://play.webvr.rocks\n* https://gohugo.io\n* https://coralproject.net\n* http://www.philipyoungg.com\n* https://gitpoint.co\n* https://2017.nodeconf.com.ar\n* https://goldenstaterecord.com\n* http://hicuties.com\n* https://urlbox.io\n* https://fontawesome.com\n* https://purple3.herokuapp.com\n* http://blunt.af/tachy.app/\n* https://fenderdigital.github.io/css-utilities/intro/\n* https://play.cash\n* https://bitmidi.com\n\nAnd of course...\n* http://tachyons.io\n\n## Sponsors\n\nDevelopment of Tachyons is supported by\n\n* [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com)\n* [DWYL](https://dwyl.com)\n* [VTEX](https://vtex.com)\n* [Manifold](https://manifold.co)\n\n## Help\n\nIf you have a question or need help feel free to [open an issue here](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/issues/new) or jump into the [Tachyons slack channel](http://tachyons-slack-invite.herokuapp.com).\n",
