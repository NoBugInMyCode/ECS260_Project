For the latest features and updates, please visit the [Arduino IDE 2.x](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide) repository. If you encounter issues related to the newer IDE, please report them there.\n\nArduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple I/O board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing and MaxMSP). The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source IDE can be downloaded for free at [https://arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).\n\n![Github](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/arduino/Arduino)\n\n## More info at\n\n- [Our website](https://www.arduino.cc/)\n- [The forums](https://forum.arduino.cc/)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arduino)\n- And like us at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/official.arduino)\n\n## Bug reports and technical discussions\n\n- To report a *bug* in the software or to request *a simple enhancement*, go to [Github Issues](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues).\n- More complex requests and technical discussions should go on the [Arduino Developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/arduino.cc/forum/#!forum/developers).\n- If you're interested in modifying or extending the Arduino software, we strongly suggest discussing your ideas on the [Developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/arduino.cc/forum/#!forum/developers) *before* starting to work on them. That way you can coordinate with the Arduino Team and others, giving your work a higher chance of being integrated into the official release.\n\n### Security\n\nIf you think you found a vulnerability or other security-related bug in this project, please read our [security policy](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/security/policy) and report the bug to our Security Team \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f. Thank you!\n\ne-mail contact: security@arduino.cc\n\n## Installation\n\nDetailed instructions for installation on popular operating systems can be found at:\n\n- [Linux](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux) (see also the [Arduino playground](https://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Linux))\n- [macOS](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/macOS)\n- [Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)\n\n## Contents of this repository\n\nThis repository contains just the code for the Arduino IDE itself. Originally, it also contained the AVR and SAM Arduino core and libraries (i.e. the code that is compiled as part of a sketch and runs on the actual Arduino device), but those have been moved into their own repositories. They are still automatically downloaded as part of the build process and included in built releases, though.\n\nThe repositories for these extra parts can be found here:\n- Non-core specific Libraries are listed under: [Arduino Libraries](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/) (and also a few other places, see `build/build.xml`).\n- The AVR core can be found at: [ArduinoCore-avr](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr).\n- Other cores are not included by default but can be installed through the board manager. Their repositories can also be found under [Arduino GitHub organization](https://github.com/arduino/).\n\n## Building and testing\n\nInstructions for building the IDE and running unit tests can be found on the wiki:\n- [Building Arduino](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Building-Arduino)\n- [Testing Arduino](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Testing-Arduino)\n\n## Credits\n\nArduino is an open-source project, supported by many. The Arduino team is composed of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, and David A. Mellis.\n\nArduino uses [GNU avr-gcc toolchain](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/avr-gcc), [GCC ARM Embedded toolchain](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded), [avr-libc](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/), [avrdude](https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/), [bossac](http://www.shumatech.com/web/products/bossa), [openOCD](http://openocd.org/), and code from [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co).\n\nIcon and about image designed by [ToDo](https://www.todo.to.it/).\n",
