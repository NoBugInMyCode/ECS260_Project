Check ```datasets/preprocess.py``` to see some examples.\nAfter that, you need to set ```dataset``` fields in ```config.json```.\n\nSome of the public datasets that we successfully applied TTS:\n\n- [LJ Speech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/)\n- [Nancy](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/blizzard/2011/lessac_blizzard2011/)\n- [TWEB](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/the-world-english-bible-speech-dataset)\n- [M-AI-Labs](http://www.caito.de/2019/01/the-m-ailabs-speech-dataset/)\n- [LibriTTS](https://openslr.org/60/)\n- [Spanish](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sm_zyBo67XHkiFhcRSQ4YaHPYM0slO_e/view?usp=sharing) - thx! @carlfm01\n\n## Example: Synthesizing Speech on Terminal Using the Released Models.\n\nAfter the installation, TTS provides a CLI interface for synthesizing speech using pre-trained models. You can either use your own model or the release models under the TTS project.\n\nListing released TTS models.\n```bash\ntts --list_models\n```\n\nRun a tts and a vocoder model from the released model list. (Simply copy and paste the full model names from the list as arguments for the command below.)\n```bash\ntts --text \"Text for TTS\" \\\n    --model_name \"<type>/<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>\" \\\n    --vocoder_name \"<type>/<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>\" \\\n    --out_path folder/to/save/output/\n```\n\nRun your own TTS model (Using Griffin-Lim Vocoder)\n```bash\ntts --text \"Text for TTS\" \\\n    --model_path path/to/model.pth.tar \\\n    --config_path path/to/config.json \\\n    --out_path output/path/speech.wav\n```\n\nRun your own TTS and Vocoder models\n```bash\ntts --text \"Text for TTS\" \\\n    --model_path path/to/config.json \\\n    --config_path path/to/model.pth.tar \\\n    --out_path output/path/speech.wav \\\n    --vocoder_path path/to/vocoder.pth.tar \\\n    --vocoder_config_path path/to/vocoder_config.json\n```\n\n**Note:** You can use ```./TTS/bin/synthesize.py``` if you prefer running ```tts``` from the TTS project folder.\n\n## Example: Training and Fine-tuning LJ-Speech Dataset\nHere you can find a [CoLab](https://gist.github.com/erogol/97516ad65b44dbddb8cd694953187c5b) notebook for a hands-on example, training LJSpeech. Or you can manually follow the guideline below.\n\nTo start with, split ```metadata.csv``` into train and validation subsets respectively ```metadata_train.csv``` and ```metadata_val.csv```. Note that for text-to-speech, validation performance might be misleading since the loss value does not directly measure the voice quality to the human ear and it also does not measure the attention module performance. Therefore, running the model with new sentences and listening to the results is the best way to go.\n\n```\nshuf metadata.csv > metadata_shuf.csv\nhead -n 12000 metadata_shuf.csv > metadata_train.csv\ntail -n 1100 metadata_shuf.csv > metadata_val.csv\n```\n\nTo train a new model, you need to define your own ```config.json``` to define model details, trainin configuration and more (check the examples). Then call the corressponding train script.\n\nFor instance, in order to train a tacotron or tacotron2 model on LJSpeech dataset, follow these steps.\n\n```bash\npython TTS/bin/train_tacotron.py --config_path TTS/tts/configs/config.json\n```\n\nTo fine-tune a model, use ```--restore_path```.\n\n```bash\npython TTS/bin/train_tacotron.py --config_path TTS/tts/configs/config.json --restore_path /path/to/your/model.pth.tar\n```\n\nTo continue an old training run, use ```--continue_path```.\n\n```bash\npython TTS/bin/train_tacotron.py --continue_path /path/to/your/run_folder/\n```\n\nFor multi-GPU training, call ```distribute.py```. It runs any provided train script in multi-GPU setting.\n\n```bash\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\"0,1,4\" python TTS/bin/distribute.py --script train_tacotron.py --config_path TTS/tts/configs/config.json\n```\n\nEach run creates a new output folder accomodating used ```config.json```, model checkpoints and tensorboard logs.\n\nIn case of any error or intercepted execution, if there is no checkpoint yet under the output folder, the whole folder is going to be removed.\n\nYou can also enjoy Tensorboard,  if you point Tensorboard argument```--logdir``` to the experiment folder.\n\n## Contribution Guidelines\nThis repository is governed by Mozilla's code of conduct and etiquette guidelines.
