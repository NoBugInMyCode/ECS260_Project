These feature vectors are directly fed into VITS without the need for conversion to a text-based intermediate representation. As a result, the pitch and intonations of the original audio are preserved. Meanwhile, the vocoder was replaced with [NSF HiFiGAN](https://github.com/openvpi/DiffSinger/tree/refactor/modules/nsf_hifigan) to solve the problem of sound interruption.\r\n\r\n### \ud83c\udd95 4.1-Stable Version Update Content\r\n\r\n- Feature input is changed to the 12th Layer of [Content Vec](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec) Transformer output, And compatible with 4.0 branches.\r\n- Update the shallow diffusion, you can use the shallow diffusion model to improve the sound quality.\r\n- Added Whisper-PPG encoder support\r\n- Added static/dynamic sound fusion\r\n- Added loudness embedding\r\n- Added Functionality of feature retrieval from [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI)\r\n  \r\n### \ud83c\udd95 Questions about compatibility with the 4.0 model\r\n\r\n- To support the 4.0 model and incorporate the speech encoder, you can make modifications to the `config.json` file. Add the `speech_encoder` field to the \"model\" section as shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"model\": {\r\n    .........\r\n    \"ssl_dim\": 256,\r\n    \"n_speakers\": 200,\r\n    \"speech_encoder\":\"vec256l9\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### \ud83c\udd95 Shallow diffusion\r\n![Diagram](shadowdiffusion.png)\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcac Python Version\r\n\r\nBased on our testing, we have determined that the project runs stable on `Python 3.8.9`.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udce5 Pre-trained Model Files\r\n\r\n#### **Required**\r\n\r\n**You need to select one encoder from the list below**\r\n\r\n##### **1.

Slice audio\r\n\r\nTo avoid video memory overflow during training or pre-processing, it is recommended to limit the length of audio clips. Cutting the audio to a length of \"5s - 15s\" is more recommended. Slightly longer times are acceptable, however, excessively long clips may cause problems such as `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError`.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the slicing process, you can use [audio-slicer-GUI](https://github.com/flutydeer/audio-slicer) or [audio-slicer-CLI](https://github.com/openvpi/audio-slicer)\r\n\r\nIn general, only the `Minimum Interval` needs to be adjusted. For spoken audio, the default value usually suffices, while for singing audio, it can be adjusted to around `100` or even `50`, depending on the specific requirements.\r\n\r\nAfter slicing, it is recommended to remove any audio clips that are excessively long or too short.\r\n\r\n**If you are using whisper-ppg encoder for training, the audio clips must shorter than 30s.**\r\n\r\n### 1. Resample to 44100Hz and mono\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npython resample.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Cautions\r\n\r\nAlthough this project has resample.py scripts for resampling, mono and loudness matching, the default loudness matching is to match to 0db. This can cause damage to the sound quality. While python's loudness matching package pyloudnorm does not limit the level, this can lead to sonic boom. Therefore, it is recommended to consider using professional sound processing software, such as `adobe audition` for loudness matching. If you are already using other software for loudness matching, add the parameter `-skip_loudnorm` to the run command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npython resample.py --skip_loudnorm\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Automatically split the dataset into training and validation sets, and generate configuration files.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npython preprocess_flist_config.py --speech_encoder vec768l12\r\n```\r\n\r\nspeech_encoder has the following options\r\n\r\n```\r\nvec768l12\r\nvec256l9\r\nhubertsoft\r\nwhisper-ppg\r\ncnhubertlarge\r\ndphubert\r\nwhisper-ppg-large\r\nwavlmbase+\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the speech_encoder argument is omitted, the default value is `vec768l12`\r\n\r\n**Use loudness embedding**\r\n\r\nAdd `--vol_aug` if you want to enable loudness embedding:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npython preprocess_flist_config.py --speech_encoder vec768l12 --vol_aug\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter enabling loudness embedding, the trained model will match the loudness of the input source; otherwise, it will match the loudness of the training set.\r\n\r\n#### You can modify some parameters in the generated config.json and diffusion.yaml\r\n\r\n* `keep_ckpts`: Keep the the the number of previous models during training. Set to `0` to keep them all. Default is `3`.\r\n\r\n* `all_in_mem`: Load all dataset to RAM. It can be enabled when the disk IO of some platforms is too low and the system memory is **much larger** than your dataset.\r\n  \r\n* `batch_size`: The amount of data loaded to the GPU for a single training session can be adjusted to a size lower than the GPU memory capacity.\r\n\r\n* `vocoder_name`: Select a vocoder.

If there is a discontinuous voice after forced slicing, you can adjust this value. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the default value of 0.\r\n- `-f0p` | `--f0_predictor`: Select a F0 predictor, options are `crepe`, `pm`, `dio`, `harvest`, `rmvpe`,`fcpe`, default value is `pm`(note: f0 mean pooling will be enable when using `crepe`)\r\n- `-a` | `--auto_predict_f0`: automatic pitch prediction, do not enable this when converting singing voices as it can cause serious pitch issues.\r\n- `-cm` | `--cluster_model_path`: Cluster model or feature retrieval index path, if left blank, it will be automatically set as the default path of these models. If there is no training cluster or feature retrieval, fill in at will.\r\n- `-cr` | `--cluster_infer_ratio`: The proportion of clustering scheme or feature retrieval ranges from 0 to 1. If there is no training clustering model or feature retrieval, the default is 0.\r\n- `-eh` | `--enhance`: Whether to use NSF_HIFIGAN enhancer, this option has certain effect on sound quality enhancement for some models with few training sets, but has negative effect on well-trained models, so it is disabled by default.\r\n- `-shd` | `--shallow_diffusion`: Whether to use shallow diffusion, which can solve some electrical sound problems after use.

This option can yield varying results - sometimes positive and sometimes negative.\r\n\r\n### Cautions\r\n\r\nIf inferencing using `whisper-ppg` speech encoder, you need to set `--clip` to 25 and `-lg` to 1. Otherwise it will fail to infer properly.\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\udd14 Optional Settings\r\n\r\nIf you are satisfied with the previous results, or if you do not feel you understand what follows, you can skip it and it will have no effect on the use of the model. The impact of these optional settings mentioned is relatively small, and while they may have some impact on specific datasets, in most cases the difference may not be significant.\r\n\r\n### Automatic f0 prediction\r\n\r\nDuring the training of the 4.0 model, an f0 predictor is also trained, which enables automatic pitch prediction during voice conversion. However, if the results are not satisfactory, manual pitch prediction can be used instead. Please note that when converting singing voices, it is advised not to enable this feature as it may cause significant pitch shifting.\r\n\r\n- Set `auto_predict_f0` to `true` in `inference_main.py`.\r\n\r\n### Cluster-based timbre leakage control\r\n\r\nIntroduction: The clustering scheme implemented in this model aims to reduce timbre leakage and enhance the similarity of the trained model to the target's timbre, although the effect may not be very pronounced. However, relying solely on clustering can reduce the model's clarity and make it sound less distinct. Therefore, a fusion method is adopted in this model to control the balance between the clustering and non-clustering approaches. This allows manual adjustment of the trade-off between \"sounding like the target's timbre\" and \"have clear enunciation\" to find an optimal balance.\r\n\r\nNo changes are required in the existing steps. Simply train an additional clustering model, which incurs relatively low training costs.\r\n\r\n- Training process:\r\n  - Train on a machine with good CPU performance. According to extant experience, it takes about 4 minutes to train each speaker on a Tencent Cloud machine with 6-core CPU.\r\n  - Execute `python cluster/train_cluster.py`. The output model will be saved in `logs/44k/kmeans_10000.pt`.\r\n  - The clustering model can currently be trained using the gpu by executing `python cluster/train_cluster.py --gpu`\r\n- Inference process:\r\n  - Specify `cluster_model_path` in `inference_main.py`. If not specified, the default is `logs/44k/kmeans_10000.pt`.\r\n  - Specify `cluster_infer_ratio` in `inference_main.py`, where `0` means not using clustering at all, `1` means only using clustering, and usually `0.5` is sufficient.\r\n\r\n### Feature retrieval\r\n\r\nIntroduction: As with the clustering scheme, the timbre leakage can be reduced, the enunciation is slightly better than clustering, but it will reduce the inference speed. By employing the fusion method, it becomes possible to linearly control the balance between feature retrieval and non-feature retrieval, allowing for fine-tuning of the desired proportion.\r\n\r\n- Training process: \r\n  First, it needs to be executed after generating hubert and f0: \r\n\r\n```shell\r\npython train_index.py -c configs/config.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output of the model will be in `logs/44k/feature_and_index.pkl`\r\n\r\n- Inference process: \r\n  - The `--feature_retrieval` needs to be formulated first, and the clustering mode automatically switches to the feature retrieval mode.\r\n  - Specify `cluster_model_path` in `inference_main.py`. If not specified, the default is `logs/44k/feature_and_index.pkl`.\r\n  - Specify `cluster_infer_ratio` in `inference_main.py`, where `0` means not using feature retrieval at all, `1` means only using feature retrieval, and usually `0.5` is sufficient.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udddc\ufe0f Model compression\r\n\r\nThe generated model contains data that is needed for further training. If you confirm that the model is final and not be used in further training, it is safe to remove these data to get smaller file size (about 1/3).\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Example\r\npython compress_model.py -c=\"configs/config.json\" -i=\"logs/44k/G_30400.pth\" -o=\"logs/44k/release.pth\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 Timbre mixing\r\n\r\n### Static Tone Mixing\r\n\r\n**Refer to `webUI.py` file for stable Timbre mixing of the gadget/lab feature.**\r\n\r\nIntroduction: This function can combine multiple models into one model (convex combination or linear combination of multiple model parameters) to create mixed voice that do not exist in reality\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n1. This feature is only supported for single-speaker models\r\n2. If you force a multi-speaker model, it is critical to make sure there are the same number of speakers in each model. This will ensure that sounds with the same SpeakerID can be mixed correctly.\r\n3. Ensure that the `model` fields in config.json of all models to be mixed are the same\r\n4. The mixed model can use any config.json file from the models being synthesized. However, the clustering model will not be functional after mixed.\r\n5. When batch uploading models, it is best to put the models into a folder and upload them together after selecting them\r\n6. It is suggested to adjust the mixing ratio between 0 and 100, or to other numbers, but unknown effects will occur in the linear combination mode\r\n7. After mixing, the file named output.pth will be saved in the root directory of the project\r\n8. Convex combination mode will perform Softmax to add the mix ratio to 1, while linear combination mode will not\r\n\r\n### Dynamic timbre mixing\r\n\r\n**Refer to the `spkmix.py` file for an introduction to dynamic timbre mixing**\r\n\r\nCharacter mix track writing rules:\r\n\r\nRole ID: \\[\\[Start time 1, end time 1, start value 1, start value 1], [Start time 2, end time 2, start value 2]]\r\n\r\nThe start time must be the same as the end time of the previous one. The first start time must be 0, and the last end time must be 1 (time ranges from 0 to 1).\r\n\r\nAll roles must be filled in. For unused roles, fill \\[\\[0., 1., 0., 0.]]\r\n\r\nThe fusion value can be filled in arbitrarily, and the linear change from the start value to the end value within the specified period of time. The \r\n\r\ninternal linear combination will be automatically guaranteed to be 1 (convex combination condition), so it can be used safely\r\n\r\nUse the `--use_spk_mix` parameter when reasoning to enable dynamic timbre mixing\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udce4 Exporting to Onnx\r\n\r\nUse [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py)\r\n\r\n- Create a folder named `checkpoints` and open it\r\n- Create a folder in the `checkpoints` folder as your project folder, naming it after your project, for example `aziplayer`\r\n- Rename your model as `model.pth`, the configuration file as `config.json`, and place them in the `aziplayer` folder you just created\r\n- Modify `\"NyaruTaffy\"` in `path = \"NyaruTaffy\"` in [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py) to your project name, `path = \"aziplayer\"`\uff08onnx_export_speaker_mix makes you can mix speaker's voice\uff09\r\n- Run [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py)\r\n- Wait for it to finish running. A `model.onnx` will be generated in your project folder, which is the exported model.\r\n\r\nNote: For Hubert Onnx models, please use the models provided by MoeSS. Currently, they cannot be exported on their own (Hubert in fairseq has many unsupported operators and things involving constants that can cause errors or result in problems with the input/output shape and results when exported.)\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcce Reference\r\n\r\n| URL | Designation | Title | Implementation Source |\r\n| --- | ----------- | ----- | --------------------- |\r\n|[2106.06103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06103) | VITS (Synthesizer)| Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Adversarial Learning for End-to-End Text-to-Speech | [jaywalnut310/vits](https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits) |\r\n|[2111.02392](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02392) | SoftVC (Speech Encoder)| A Comparison of Discrete and Soft Speech Units for Improved Voice Conversion | [bshall/hubert](https://github.com/bshall/hubert) |\r\n|[2204.09224](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09224) | ContentVec (Speech Encoder)| ContentVec: An Improved Self-Supervised Speech Representation by Disentangling Speakers | [auspicious3000/contentvec](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec) |\r\n|[2212.04356](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356) | Whisper (Speech Encoder) | Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision | [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) |\r\n|[2110.13900](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13900) | WavLM (Speech Encoder) | WavLM: Large-Scale Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Full Stack Speech Processing | [microsoft/unilm/wavlm](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/wavlm) |\r\n|[2305.17651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17651) | DPHubert (Speech Encoder) | DPHuBERT: Joint Distillation and Pruning of Self-Supervised Speech Models | [pyf98/DPHuBERT](https://github.com/pyf98/DPHuBERT) |\r\n|[DOI:10.21437/Interspeech.2017-68](http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2017-68) | Harvest (F0 Predictor) | Harvest: A high-performance fundamental frequency estimator from speech signals | [mmorise/World/harvest](https://github.com/mmorise/World/blob/master/src/harvest.cpp) |\r\n|[aes35-000039](https://www.aes.org/e-lib/online/browse.cfm?elib=15165) | Dio (F0 Predictor) | Fast and reliable F0 estimation method based on the period extraction of vocal fold vibration of singing voice and speech | [mmorise/World/dio](https://github.com/mmorise/World/blob/master/src/dio.cpp) |\r\n|[8461329](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8461329) | Crepe (F0 Predictor) | Crepe: A Convolutional Representation for Pitch Estimation | [maxrmorrison/torchcrepe](https://github.com/maxrmorrison/torchcrepe) |\r\n|[DOI:10.1016/j.wocn.2018.07.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2018.07.001) | Parselmouth (F0 Predictor) | Introducing Parselmouth: A Python interface to Praat | [YannickJadoul/Parselmouth](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth) |\r\n|[2306.15412v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15412v2) | RMVPE (F0 Predictor) | RMVPE: A Robust Model for Vocal Pitch Estimation in Polyphonic Music | [Dream-High/RMVPE](https://github.com/Dream-High/RMVPE) |\r\n|[2010.05646](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646) | HIFIGAN (Vocoder) | HiFi-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Efficient and High Fidelity Speech Synthesis | [jik876/hifi-gan](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan) |\r\n|[1810.11946](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11946.pdf) | NSF (Vocoder) | Neural source-filter-based waveform model for statistical parametric speech synthesis | [openvpi/DiffSinger/modules/nsf_hifigan](https://github.com/openvpi/DiffSinger/tree/refactor/modules/nsf_hifigan)\r\n|[2006.08195](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08195) | Snake (Vocoder) | Neural Networks Fail to Learn Periodic Functions and How to Fix It | [EdwardDixon/snake](https://github.com/EdwardDixon/snake)\r\n|[2105.02446v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02446v3) | Shallow Diffusion (PostProcessing)| DiffSinger: Singing Voice Synthesis via Shallow Diffusion Mechanism | [CNChTu/Diffusion-SVC](https://github.com/CNChTu/Diffusion-SVC) |\r\n|[K-means](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=01D65490BADCC216F350D06F84D721AD?doi=10.1.1.308.8619&rep=rep1&type=pdf) | Feature K-means Clustering (PreProcessing)| Some methods for classification and analysis of multivariate observations | This repo |\r\n| | Feature TopK Retrieval (PreProcessing)| Retrieval based Voice Conversion | [RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI) |\r\n| | whisper ppg| whisper ppg | [PlayVoice/whisper_ppg](https://github.com/PlayVoice/whisper_ppg) |\r\n| | bigvgan| bigvgan | [PlayVoice/so-vits-svc-5.0](https://github.com/PlayVoice/so-vits-svc-5.0/tree/bigvgan-mix-v2/vits_decoder/alias) |\r\n\r\n\r\n## \u2600\ufe0f Previous contributors\r\n\r\nFor some reason the author deleted the original repository.
