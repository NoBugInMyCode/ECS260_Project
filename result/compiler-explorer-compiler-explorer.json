An overview\nof what the site lets you achieve, why it's useful, and how to use it is\n[available here](docs/WhatIsCompilerExplorer.md).\n\n**Compiler Explorer** follows a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which aims to foster an open and welcoming\nenvironment.\n\n**Compiler Explorer** was started in 2012 to show how C++ constructs are translated to assembly code. It started as a\n`tmux` session with `vi` running in one pane and `watch gcc -S foo.cc -o -` running in the other.\n\nSince then, it has become a public website serving over\n[3,000,000 compilations per week](https://stats.compiler-explorer.com).\n\nYou can financially support [this project on Patreon](https://patreon.com/mattgodbolt),\n[GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/mattgodbolt/),\n[Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=KQWQZ7GPY2GZ6&item_name=Compiler+Explorer+development&currency_code=USD&source=url),\nor by buying cool gear on the [Compiler Explorer store](https://shop.spreadshirt.com/compiler-explorer/).\n\n## Using Compiler Explorer\n\n### FAQ\n\nThere is now a FAQ section [in the repository wiki](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/wiki/FAQ). If\nyour question is not present, please contact us as described below, so we can help you. If you find that the FAQ is\nlacking some important point, please feel free to contribute to it and/or ask us to clarify it.\n\n### Videos\n\nSeveral videos showcase some features of Compiler Explorer:\n\n- [Compiler Explorer 2023: What's New?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey0H79z_pco): Presentation for CppNorth 2023.\n- [Presentation for CppCon 2019 about the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIoZDUd5DKw)\n- [Older 2 part series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_HL3PH4wDg) which go into a bit more detail into the\n  more obscure features.\n- [Just Enough Assembly for Compiler Explorer](https://youtu.be/QLolzolunJ4): Practical introduction to Assembly with a\n  focus on the usage of Compiler Explorer, from CppCon 2021.\n- [Playlist: Compiler Explorer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2HVqYf7If8dNYVN6ayjB06FPyhHCcnhG): A collection\n  of videos discussing Compiler Explorer; using it, installing it, what it's for, etc.\n\nA [Road map](docs/Roadmap.md) is available which gives a little insight into the future plans for **Compiler Explorer**.\n\n## Developing\n\n**Compiler Explorer** is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).\n\nAssuming you have a compatible version of `node` installed, on Linux simply running `make` ought to get you up and\nrunning with an Explorer running on port 10240 on your local machine:\n[http://localhost:10240/](http://localhost:10240/). If this doesn't work for you, please contact us, as we consider it\nimportant you can quickly and easily get running. Currently, **Compiler Explorer** requires\n[`node` 20](CONTRIBUTING.md#node-version) installed, either on the path or at `NODE_DIR` (an environment variable or\n`make` parameter).\n\nRunning with `make EXTRA_ARGS='--language LANG'` will allow you to load `LANG` exclusively, where `LANG` is one for the\nlanguage ids/aliases defined in `lib/languages.ts`. For example, to only run **Compiler Explorer** with C++ support,\nyou'd run `make EXTRA_ARGS='--language c++'`. You can supply multiple `--language` arguments to restrict to more than\none language. The `Makefile` will automatically install all the third-party libraries needed to run; using `npm` to\ninstall server-side and client-side components.\n\nFor development, we suggest using `make dev` to enable some useful features, such as automatic reloading on file changes\nand shorter startup times.\n\nYou can also use `npm run dev` to run if `make dev` doesn't work on your machine.\n\nSome languages need extra tools to demangle them, e.g. `rust`, `d`, or `haskell`. Such tools are kept separately in the\n[tools repo](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer-tools).\n\nConfiguring compiler explorer is achieved via configuration files in the `etc/config` directory. Values are `key=value`.\nOptions in a `{type}.local.properties` file (where `{type}` is `c++` or similar) override anything in the\n`{type}.defaults.properties` file. There is a `.gitignore` file to ignore `*.local.*` files, so these won't be checked\ninto git, and you won't find yourself fighting with updated versions when you `git pull`. For more information see\n[Adding a Compiler](docs/AddingACompiler.md).\n\nCheck [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information about how you can contribute to **Compiler\nExplorer**, and the [docs](./docs) folder for specific details regarding various things you might want to do, such as\nhow to add new compilers or languages to the site.\n\n### Running a local instance\n\nIf you want to point it at your own GCC or similar binaries, either edit the `etc/config/LANG.defaults.properties` or\nelse make a new one with the name `LANG.local.properties`, substituting `LANG` as needed. `*.local.properties` files\nhave the highest priority when loading properties.\n\nIf you want to support multiple compilers and languages like [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org), you can use the\n`bin/ce_install install compilers` command in the [infra](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/infra) project to install\nall or some of the compilers. Compilers installed in this way can be loaded through the configuration in\n`etc/config/*.amazon.properties`. If you need to deploy in a completely offline environment, you may need to remove some\nparts of the configuration that are pulled from `www.godbolt.ms@443`.\n\nWhen running in a corporate setting the URL shortening service can be replaced by an internal one if the default storage\ndriver isn't appropriate for your environment. To do this, add a new module in `lib/shortener/myservice.js` and set the\n`urlShortenService` variable in configuration. This module should export a single function, see the\n[tinyurl module](lib/shortener/tinyurl.ts) for an example.\n\n### RESTful API\n\nThere's a simple restful API that can be used to do compiles to asm and to list compilers.\n\nYou can find the API documentation [here](docs/API.md).\n\n## Contact us\n\nWe run a [Compiler Explorer Discord](https://discord.gg/B5WacA7), which is a place to discuss using or developing\nCompiler Explorer. We also have a presence on the [cpplang](https://cppalliance.org/slack/) Slack channel\n`#compiler_explorer` and we have\n[a public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/compiler-explorer-discussion).\n\nThere's a development channel on the discord, and also a\n[development mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/compiler-explorer-development).\n\nFeel free to raise an issue on [github](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/issues) or\n[email Matt directly](mailto:matt@godbolt.org) for more help.\n\n## Official domains\n\nFollowing are the official domains for Compiler Explorer:\n\n- https://godbolt.org/\n- https://godbo.lt/\n- https://compiler-explorer.com/\n\nThe domains allow arbitrary subdomains, e.g., https://foo.godbolt.org/, which is convenient since each subdomain has an\nindependent local state. Also, language subdomains such as https://rust.compiler-explorer.com/ will load with that\nlanguage already selected.\n\n## Credits\n\n**Compiler Explorer** is maintained by the awesome people listed in the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.md) file.\n\nWe would like to thank the contributors listed in the [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file, who have helped shape\n**Compiler Explorer**.\n\nWe would also like to specially thank these people for their contributions to **Compiler Explorer**:\n\n- [Gabriel Devillers](https://github.com/voxelf) (_while working for [Kalray](http://www.kalrayinc.com/)_)\n- [Johan Engelen](https://github.com/JohanEngelen)\n- [Joshua Sheard](https://github.com/jsheard)\n- [Andrew Pardoe](https://github.com/AndrewPardoe)\n\nMany [amazing sponsors](https://godbolt.org/#sponsors), both individuals and companies, have helped fund and promote\nCompiler Explorer.\n",
