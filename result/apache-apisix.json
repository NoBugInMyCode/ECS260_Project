Developers can choose the language according to their needs and after starting an independent process with the RPC, it exchanges data with APISIX through local RPC communication. Till this moment, APISIX has support for [Java](https://github.com/apache/apisix-java-plugin-runner), [Golang](https://github.com/apache/apisix-go-plugin-runner), [Python](https://github.com/apache/apisix-python-plugin-runner) and Node.js.\n  - The Wasm or WebAssembly, is an experimental way. APISIX can load and run Wasm bytecode via APISIX [wasm plugin](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/docs/en/latest/wasm.md) written with the [Proxy Wasm SDK](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec#sdks).
