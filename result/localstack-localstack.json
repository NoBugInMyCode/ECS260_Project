With LocalStack, you can run your AWS applications or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider! Whether you are testing complex CDK applications or Terraform configurations, or just beginning to learn about AWS services, LocalStack helps speed up and simplify your testing and development workflow.\n\nLocalStack supports a growing number of AWS services, like AWS Lambda, S3, Dynamodb, Kinesis, SQS, SNS, and many more! The [Pro version of LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) supports additional APIs and advanced features. You can find a comprehensive list of supported APIs on our [\u2611\ufe0f Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page.\n\nLocalStack also provides additional features to make your life as a cloud developer easier! Check out LocalStack's [User Guides](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/) for more information.\n\n## Install\n\nThe quickest way get started with LocalStack is by using the LocalStack CLI. It enables you to start and manage the LocalStack Docker container directly through your command line. Ensure that your machine has a functional [`docker` environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed before proceeding.\n\n### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)\n\nInstall the LocalStack CLI through our [official LocalStack Brew Tap](https://github.com/localstack/homebrew-tap):\n\n```bash\nbrew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli\n```\n\n### Binary download (macOS, Linux, Windows)\n\nIf Brew is not installed on your machine, you can download the pre-built LocalStack CLI binary directly:\n\n- Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the latest release for your platform.\n- Extract the downloaded archive to a directory included in your `PATH` variable:\n    -   For macOS/Linux, use the command: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`\n\n### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)\n\nLocalStack is developed using Python. To install the LocalStack CLI using `pip`, run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install localstack\n```\n\nThe `localstack-cli` installation enables you to run the Docker image containing the LocalStack runtime. To interact with the local AWS services, you need to install the `awslocal` CLI separately. For installation guidelines, refer to the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal).\n\n> **Important**: Do not use `sudo` or run as `root` user. LocalStack must be installed and started entirely under a local non-root user. If you have problems with permissions in macOS High Sierra, install with `pip install --user localstack`\n\n## Quickstart\n\nStart LocalStack inside a Docker container by running:\n\n```bash\n % localstack start -d\n\n     __                     _______ __             __\n    / /   ____  _________ _/ / ___// /_____ ______/ /__\n   / /   / __ \\/ ___/ __ `/ /\\__ \\/ __/ __ `/ ___/ //_/\n  / /___/ /_/ / /__/ /_/ / /___/ / /_/ /_/ / /__/ ,<\n /_____/\\____/\\___/\\__,_/_//____/\\__/\\__,_/\\___/_/|_|\n\n \ud83d\udcbb LocalStack CLI 4.0.0\n \ud83d\udc64 Profile: default\n\n[12:47:13] starting LocalStack in Docker mode \ud83d\udc33                       localstack.py:494\n           preparing environment                                       bootstrap.py:1240\n           configuring container                                       bootstrap.py:1248\n           starting container                                          bootstrap.py:1258\n[12:47:15] detaching                                                   bootstrap.py:1262\n```\n\nYou can query the status of respective services on LocalStack by running:\n\n```bash\n% localstack status services\n\u250f\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2533\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2513\n\u2503 Service                  \u2503 Status      \u2503\n\u2521\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2547\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2529\n\u2502 acm                      \u2502 \u2714 available \u2502\n\u2502 apigateway               \u2502 \u2714 available \u2502\n\u2502 cloudformation           \u2502 \u2714 available \u2502\n\u2502 cloudwatch               \u2502 \u2714 available \u2502\n\u2502 config                   \u2502 \u2714 available \u2502\n\u2502 dynamodb                 \u2502 \u2714 available \u2502\n...\n```\n\nTo use SQS, a fully managed distributed message queuing service, on LocalStack, run:\n\n```shell\n% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue\n{\n    \"QueueUrl\": \"http://sqs.us-east-1.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/000000000000/sample-queue\"\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [LocalStack AWS services](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/coverage/) and using them with LocalStack's `awslocal` CLI.\n\n## Running\n\nYou can run LocalStack through the following options:\n\n- [LocalStack CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-cli)\n- [Docker](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#docker)\n- [Docker Compose](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#docker-compose)\n- [Helm](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#helm)\n\n## Usage\n\nTo start using LocalStack, check out our [documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud).\n\n- [LocalStack Configuration](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/configuration/)\n- [LocalStack in CI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/ci/)\n- [LocalStack Integrations](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/)\n- [LocalStack Tools](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/)\n- [Understanding LocalStack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/faq/)\n\nTo use LocalStack with a graphical user interface, you can use the following UI clients:\n\n* [LocalStack Web Application](https://app.localstack.cloud)\n* [LocalStack Desktop](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/localstack-desktop/)\n* [LocalStack Docker Extension](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/localstack-docker-extension/)\n\n## Releases\n\nPlease refer to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/releases) to see the complete list of changes for each release.
