The Git interface you've been missing all your life has finally arrived.**\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JuQIxJu.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9rgXktz.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n</p>\n\nGit recently celebrated its 10 years anniversary, but most engineers are still confused by its intricacy (3 of the [top 5 questions of all time](http://stackoverflow.com/questions?sort=votes) on Stack Overflow are Git related). Since Git turns even simple actions into mystifying commands (\u201cgit add\u201d to stage versus \u201cgit reset HEAD\u201d to unstage anyone?), it\u2019s no surprise users waste time, get frustrated, distract the rest of their team for help, or worse, screw up their repo!\n\nGitUp is a bet to invent a new Git interaction model that lets engineers of all levels work quickly, safely, and without headaches. It's unlike any other Git client out there from the way it\u2019s built (it interacts directly with the Git database on disk), to the way it works (you manipulate the repository graph instead of manipulating commits).\n\nWith GitUp, you get a truly efficient Git client for Mac:\n- A **live and interactive repo graph** (edit, reorder, fixup, merge commits\u2026),\n- **Unlimited undo / redo** of almost all operations (even rebases and merges),\n- Time Machine like **snapshots for 1-click rollbacks** to previous repo states,\n- Features that don\u2019t even exist natively in Git like a **visual commit splitter** or a **unified reflog browser**,\n- **Instant search across the entire repo** including diff contents, \n- A **ridiculously fast UI**, often faster than the command line.\n\n*GitUp was created by [@swisspol](https://github.com/swisspol) in late 2014 as a bet to reinvent the way developers interact with Git. After several months of work, it was made available in pre-release early 2015 and reached the [top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9653978) along with being [featured by Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/tech/gitup-1) and [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/06/04/gitup). 30,000 lines of code later, GitUp reached 1.0 mid-August 2015 and was released open source as a gift to the developer community.*\n\nGetting Started\n===============\n\n- Official website: https://gitup.co\n\n## Download:\n\n- Latest release on GitHub: https://github.com/git-up/GitUp/releases\n- Homebrew (Not maintained by GitUp developers): `brew install homebrew/cask/gitup` (Note: There is already a formula called gitup, so the full name must be specified!)\n\n**Read the [docs](https://github.com/git-up/GitUp/wiki) and use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/git-up/GitUp/issues) for support & feedback.**\n\nReleases notes are available at https://github.com/git-up/GitUp/releases. Builds tagged with a `v` (e.g. `v1.2.3`) are released on the \"Stable\" channel, while builds tagged with a `b` (e.g. `b1234`) are only released on the \"Continuous\" channel. You can change the update channel used by GitUp in the app preferences.\n\n## Build\n\nTo build GitUp yourself, simply run the command `git clone --recursive https://github.com/git-up/GitUp.git` in Terminal, then open the `GitUp/GitUp.xcodeproj` Xcode project and hit Run.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If you do not have an Apple ID with a developer account for code signing Mac apps, the build  will fail with a code signing error. Simply delete the \"Code Signing Identity\" build setting of the \"Application\" target to work around the issue:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dWpJExk.png\">\n</p>\n\n**Alternatively**, if you do have a developer account, you can create the file \"Xcode-Configurations/DEVELOPMENT_TEAM.xcconfig\" with the following build setting as its content:\n> DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = [Your TeamID]\n\nFor a more detailed description of this, you can have a look at the comments at the end of the file \"Xcode-Configurations/Base.xcconfig\". \n\nGitUpKit\n========\n\n**GitUp is built as a thin layer on top of a reusable generic Git toolkit called \"GitUpKit\". This means that you can use that same GitUpKit framework to build your very own Git UI!**\n\n*GitUpKit has a very different goal than [ObjectiveGit](https://github.com/libgit2/objective-git). Instead of offering extensive raw bindings to [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2), GitUpKit only uses a minimal subset of libgit2 and reimplements everything else on top of it (it has its own \"rebase engine\" for instance).\nThis allows it to expose a very tight and consistent API, that completely follows Obj-C conventions and hides away the libgit2 complexity and sometimes inconsistencies. GitUpKit adds on top of that a number of exclusive and powerful features, from undo/redo and Time Machine like snapshots, to entire drop-in UI components.*\n\nArchitecture\n------------\n\nThe GitUpKit source code is organized as 2 independent layers communicating only through the use of public APIs:\n\n**Base Layer (depends on Foundation only and is compatible with OS X and iOS)**\n- `Core/`: wrapper around the required minimal functionality of [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2), on top of which is then implemented all the Git functionality required by GitUp (note that GitUp uses a [slightly customized fork](https://github.com/git-up/libgit2/tree/gitup) of libgit2)\n- `Extensions/`: categories on the `Core` classes to add convenience features implemented only using the public APIs\n\n**UI Layer (depends on AppKit and is compatible with OS X only)**\n- `Interface/`: low-level view classes e.g. `GIGraphView` to render the GitUp Map view\n- `Utilities/`: interface utility classes e.g. the base view controller class `GIViewController`\n- `Components/`: reusable single-view view controllers e.g. `GIDiffContentsViewController` to render a diff\n- `Views/`: high-level reusable multi-views view controllers e.g. `GIAdvancedCommitViewController` to implement the entire GitUp Advanced Commit view\n\n**IMPORTANT**: If the preprocessor constant `DEBUG` is defined to a non-zero value when building GitUpKit (this is the default when building in \"Debug\" configuration), a number of extra consistency checks are enabled at run time as well as extra logging. Be aware that this overhead can significantly affect performance.\n\nGitUpKit API\n------------\n\nUsing the GitUpKit API should be pretty straightforward since it is organized by functionality (e.g. repository, branches, commits, interface components, etc...) and a best effort has been made to name functions clearly.\n\nRegarding the \"Core\" APIs, the best way to learn them is to peruse the associated unit tests - for instance see [the branch tests](GitUpKit/Core/GCBranch-Tests.m) for the branch API.\n\nHere is some sample code to get you started (error handling is left as an exercise to the reader):\n\n**Opening and browsing a repository:**\n```objc\n// Open repo\nGCRepository* repo = [[GCRepository alloc] initWithExistingLocalRepository:<PATH> error:NULL];\n\n// Make sure repo is clean\nassert([repo checkClean:kGCCleanCheckOption_IgnoreUntrackedFiles error:NULL]);\n\n// List all branches\nNSArray* branches = [repo listAllBranches:NULL];\nNSLog(@\"%@\", branches);\n\n// Lookup HEAD\nGCLocalBranch* headBranch;  // This would be nil if the HEAD is detached\nGCCommit* headCommit;\n[repo lookupHEADCurrentCommit:&headCommit branch:&headBranch error:NULL];\nNSLog(@\"%@ = %@\", headBranch, headCommit);\n\n// Load the *entire* repo history in memory for fast access, including all commits, branches and tags\nGCHistory* history = [repo loadHistoryUsingSorting:kGCHistorySorting_ReverseChronological error:NULL];\nassert(history);\nNSLog(@\"%lu commits total\", history.allCommits.count);\nNSLog(@\"%@\\n%@\", history.rootCommits, history.leafCommits);\n```\n\n**Modifying a repository:**\n```objc\n// Take a snapshot of the repo\nGCSnapshot* snapshot = [repo takeSnapshot:NULL];\n\n// Create a new branch and check it out\nGCLocalBranch* newBranch = [repo createLocalBranchFromCommit:headCommit withName:@\"temp\" force:NO error:NULL];\nNSLog(@\"%@\", newBranch);\nassert([repo checkoutLocalBranch:newBranch options:0 error:NULL]);\n\n// Add a file to the index\n[[NSData data] writeToFile:[repo.workingDirectoryPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:@\"empty.data\"] atomically:YES];\nassert([repo addFileToIndex:@\"empty.data\" error:NULL]);\n\n// Check index status\nGCDiff* diff = [repo diffRepositoryIndexWithHEAD:nil options:0 maxInterHunkLines:0 maxContextLines:0 error:NULL];\nassert(diff.deltas.count == 1);\nNSLog(@\"%@\", diff);\n\n// Create a commit\nGCCommit* newCommit = [repo createCommitFromHEADWithMessage:@\"Added file\" error:NULL];\nassert(newCommit);\nNSLog(@\"%@\", newCommit);\n\n// Restore repo to saved snapshot before topic branch and commit were created\nBOOL success = [repo restoreSnapshot:snapshot withOptions:kGCSnapshotOption_IncludeAll reflogMessage:@\"Rolled back\" didUpdateReferences:NULL error:NULL];\nassert(success);\n  \n// Make sure topic branch is gone\nassert([repo findLocalBranchWithName:@\"temp\" error:NULL] == nil);\n  \n// Update workdir and index to match HEAD\nassert([repo resetToHEAD:kGCResetMode_Hard error:NULL]);\n```\n\nComplete Example #1: GitDown\n----------------------------\n\n[GitDown](Examples/GitDown) is a very basic app that prompts the user for a repo and displays an interactive and live-updating list of its stashes (all with ~20 lines of code in `-[AppDelegate applicationDidFinishLaunching:]`):\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZfxM7su.png\">\n</p>\n\nThrough GitUpKit, this basic app also gets for free unlimited undo/redo, unified and side-by-side diffs, text selection and copy, keyboard shortcuts, etc...\n\nThis source code also demonstrates how to use some other GitUpKit view controllers as well as building a customized one.\n\nComplete Example #2: GitDiff\n----------------------------\n\n[GitDiff](Examples/GitDiff) demonstrates how to create a view controller that displays a live updating diff between `HEAD` and the workdir \u00e0 la `git diff HEAD`:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/29hxDcJ.png\">\n</p>\n\nComplete Example #3: GitY\n-------------------------\n\n[GitY](Examples/GitY) is a [GitX](http://gitx.frim.nl/) clone built using GitUpKit and less than 200 lines of code:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6cuPcT4.png\">\n</p>\n\nComplete Example #4: iGit\n-------------------------\n\n[iGit](Examples/iGit) is a test iOS app that simply uses GitUpKit to clone a GitHub repo and perform a commit.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n- [@swisspol](https://github.com/swisspol): concept and code\n- [@wwayneee](https://github.com/wwayneee): UI design\n- [@jayeb](https://github.com/jayeb): website\n\n*Also a big thanks to the fine [libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/) contributors without whom GitUp would have never existed!*\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nGitUp is copyright 2015-2018 Pierre-Olivier Latour and available under [GPL v3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt).
