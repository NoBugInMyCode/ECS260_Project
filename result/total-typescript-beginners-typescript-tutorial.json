There, you'll find:\n\n- Video explanations for each problem and solution\n- Transcripts\n- Text explanations\n- A built-in Stackblitz editor\n\n```sh\n# Installs all dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Asks you which exercise you'd like to run, and runs it\nnpm run exercise\n```\n\n## How to take the course\n\nYou'll notice that the course is split into exercises. Each exercise is split into a `*.problem` and a `*.solution`.\n\nTo take an exercise:\n\n1. Run `npm run exercise`\n2. Choose which exercise you'd like to run.\n\nThis course encourages **active, exploratory learning**. In the video, I'll explain a problem, and **you'll be asked to try to find a solution**. To attempt a solution, you'll need to:\n\n1. Check out [TypeScript's docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html).\n1. Try to find something that looks relevant.\n1. Give it a go to see if it solves the problem.\n\nYou'll know if you've succeeded because the tests will pass.\n\n**If you succeed**, or **if you get stuck**, unpause the video and check out the `*.solution`. You can see if your solution is better or worse than mine!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSay thanks to Matt on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk) or by joining his [Discord](https://discord.gg/8S5ujhfTB3).
