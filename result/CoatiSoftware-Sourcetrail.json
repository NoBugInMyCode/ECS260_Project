However, our CMake based setup allows to disable indexing support for specific languages which reduces the number of dependencies to a minimum.\n\n## Building the Base Application\n\n### Required Tools\n\n* __CMake v3.12 (required for Windows, Linux and MacOS)__\n    * __Reason__: Used to generate a build configuration for your build system\n    * __Download__: https://cmake.org/download\n\n* __Git (required for Windows, Linux and MacOS)__\n    * __Reason__: Used for version control and to automatically generate the Sourcetrail version number from commits and tags\n    * __Download__: https://git-scm.com/download\n    * __Remarks__: Make sure `git` is added to your `PATH` environment variable before running CMake\n\n* __Visual Studio (required for Windows)__\n    * __Reason__: Used for building Sourcetrail\n    * __Download__: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/\n\n* __ccache (optional for Linux and MacOS)__\n    * __Reason__: Used to speed up rebuilds if found in `PATH`\n    * __Download__: https://ccache.dev/download.html\n\n### Required dependencies\n\n* __Boost 1.67__\n    * __Reason__: Used for file system access and interprocess communication\n    * __Prebuilt Download for Windows__: https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/\n    * __Building for Unix__:\n        ```\n        $ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=filesystem,program_options,system,date_time\n        $ ./b2 --link=static --variant=release --threading=multi --runtime-link=static --cxxflags=-fPIC\n        ```\n\n* __Qt 5.12.3__\n    * __Reason__: Used for rendering the GUI and for starting additional (indexer) processes.\n    * __Prebuilt Download__: http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/\n\n### Building\n\n#### On Windows\n* To set up your build environment run:\n    ```\n    $ git clone https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail.git\n    $ cd Sourcetrail\n    $ mkdir -p build/win64\n    $ cd build/win64\n    $ cmake -G \"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64\" -DBOOST_ROOT=<path/to/boost_1_67_0> -DQt5_DIR=<path/to/Qt/version/platform/compiler/lib/cmake/Qt5> ../..\n    ```\n    _Hint: If you are using the CMake GUI, we recommend that you activate advanced mode. Also you may be required to add some of the defines via the \"Add Entry\" button._\n\n* After generating the build configuration, just open the Sourcetrail.sln file that was generated by CMake and build the Sourcetrail project.\n\n#### On Unix\n\n* To set up your build environment run:\n    ```\n    $ cd Sourcetrail\n    $ mkdir -p build/Release\n    $ cd build/Release\n    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=\"Release\" -DBOOST_ROOT=<path/to/boost_1_67_0> -DQt5_DIR=<path/to/Qt/version/platform/compiler/lib/cmake/Qt5> ../..\n    ```\n* Now start the build with:\n    ```\n    $ make Sourcetrail\n    ```\n\n### Running\n\n* Run Sourcetrail from within the build directory. During execution Sourcetrail needs resources from `bin/app/data` and `bin/app/user`. CMake creates symlinks within the build directory that make these directories accessible.\n\n\n## Enable C/C++ Language Support\n\n### Required dependencies\n\n* __LLVM/Clang 11.0.0__\n    * __Reason__: Used for running the preprocessor on the indexed source code, building and traversing an Abstract Syntax Tree and generating error messages.\n    * __Building__: Make sure to check out the correct tag: `git checkout llvmorg-11.0.0`\n    * __Building for Windows__: Follow [these steps](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) to build the project. Run the cmake command exactly as described.\n    * __Building for Unix__: Follow this [installation guide](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.html) to build the project. Make sure to build with `-DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON`.\n\n### Building\n\n* Run CMake with these additional options:\n    ```\n    -DClang_DIR=<path/to/llvm_build>/lib/cmake/clang\n    -DBUILD_CXX_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE=ON\n    ```\n* Build Sourcetrail as described [above](#building).\n\n## Enable Java Language Support\n\n### Required dependencies\n\n* __JDK 1.8__\n    * __Reason__: Used to build the Java indexer and make it callable from the C++ code via JNI.\n    * __Remarks__: Make sure that `<jdk_root>/bin` is available in your `PATH` environment variable and that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set:\n        ```\n        JAVA_HOME=<path/to/Java>/jdk1.x.x_xxx\n        ```\n\n* __Maven__\n    * __REASON__: Used within Sourcetrail's automated tests.\n    * __Remarks__:  Make sure `.../apache-maven-x.x.x/bin` is available in your `PATH` environment variable and that both `M2_HOME` and `MAVEN_HOME` environment variables are set:\n        ```\n        M2_HOME=.../apache-maven-x.x.x\n        MAVEN_HOME=.../apache-maven-x.x.x\n        ```\n\n### Building\n\n* Run CMake with these additional options:\n    ```\n    -DBUILD_JAVA_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE=ON\n    ```\n* Build Sourcetrail as described [above](#building).\n\n## Enable Python Language Support\n\n### Required Tools\n\n* __7z (required for Windows)__\n    * __REASON__: Used to extract the prebuilt SourcetrailPythonIndexer which is downloaded automatically during build execution.\n\n### Building\n\n* Run CMake with these additional options:\n    ```\n    -DBUILD_PYTHON_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE=ON\n    ```\n* Build Sourcetrail as described [above](#building).\n\n\n## Creating the deployment Package\n\n### Windows\n\n#### Required Tools\n\n* __Visual Studio (required for Windows)__\n    * __Reason__: Used for building the Sourcetrail Windows installer.\n    * __Remarks__: Make sure to install the `.Net desktop development` workload.\n    * __Download__: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/\n\n* __Wix 3.11__\n    * __Reason__: Used to build the `sourcetrail.msi` Windows installer.\n    * __Remarks__: Make sure to add `<path/to>/WiX Toolset v3.11/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.\n    * __Download__: https://wixtoolset.org/releases/\n\n* __Wix extension for Visual Studio__\n    * __Reason__: Used to run Wix from the Visual Studio build environment.\n    * __Download__: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WixToolset.WixToolsetVisualStudio2017Extension\n\n* __JRE__\n    * __Reason__: Used for indexing the java sample project that ships with the package.\n\n* __WinRAR__\n    * __Reason__: Used for creating the final zip files for the installer and the portable package.\n    * __Remarks__: Make sure to add `<path/to>/WinRAR` to your `PATH` environment variable.\n\n#### Building\n\n* Run `./script/deploy_windows.sh` from your Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio. The script which will generate a 64bit build and packages it into a portable `.zip` file and a Wix-based Windows installer, each.\n\n### macOS\n\nAfter building, run the `bundle_install.sh` script within the build directory which will create a `Sourcetrail.app` bundle and generate a `Sourcetrail_<version>.dmg` container.\n\n### Linux\n\nRun `./setup/Linux/createPackages.sh` from the main directory, which creates both a `.tar.gz` and a `.AppImage` package in the main directory. Packaging depends on [linuxdeployqt](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt).\n\n\n# How to Run the Tests\n\nThe automated test suite of Sourcetrail is powered by [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). To run the tests, simply execute the `Sourcetrail_test` binary. Before executing, please make sure to set the working directory to `./bin/test`.\n\n\n# License\n\nSourcetrail is licensed under the [GNU General Public License Version 3](LICENSE.txt).\n\n# Trademark\n\nThe \"Sourcetrail\" name is a trademark owned by Coati Software and is not included within the assets licensed under the GNU GPLv3.\n",
