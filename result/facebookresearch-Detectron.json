Please see [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), a ground-up rewrite of Detectron in PyTorch.**\n\n# Detectron\n\nDetectron is Facebook AI Research's software system that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870). It is written in Python and powered by the [Caffe2](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2) deep learning framework.\n\nAt FAIR, Detectron has enabled numerous research projects, including: [Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144), [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870), [Detecting and Recognizing Human-Object Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07333), [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002), [Non-local Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07971), [Learning to Segment Every Thing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10370), [Data Distillation: Towards Omni-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04440), [DensePose: Dense Human Pose Estimation In The Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00434), and [Group Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494).\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"demo/output/33823288584_1d21cf0a26_k_example_output.jpg\" width=\"700px\" />\n  <p>Example Mask R-CNN output.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe goal of Detectron is to provide a high-quality, high-performance\ncodebase for object detection *research*. It is designed to be flexible in order\nto support rapid implementation and evaluation of novel research. Detectron\nincludes implementations of the following object detection algorithms:\n\n- [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) -- *Marr Prize at ICCV 2017*\n- [RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) -- *Best Student Paper Award at ICCV 2017*\n- [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)\n- [RPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)\n- [Fast R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083)\n- [R-FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06409)\n\nusing the following backbone network architectures:\n\n- [ResNeXt{50,101,152}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431)\n- [ResNet{50,101,152}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)\n- [Feature Pyramid Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144) (with ResNet/ResNeXt)\n- [VGG16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)\n\nAdditional backbone architectures may be easily implemented.
