Ask questions in natural language, search for code and generate patches using your existing codebase as context. \n\nEngineers are increasing their productivity by using bloop to:\n- Explain how files or features work in simple language\n- Write new features, using their code as context\n- Understand how to use poorly documented open source libraries\n- Pinpoint errors\n- Ask questions about English language codebases in other languages\n- Reduce code duplication by checking for existing functionality\n\nhttps://github.com/BloopAI/bloop/assets/7957964/01db3ccb-4af0-49a0-92d6-5a9c42357a51\n\n## Features\n\n- AI-based conversational search\n- Code Studio, an LLM playground that uses your code as context\n- Blazing fast regex search\n- Sync your local and GitHub repositories\n- Sophisticated query filters so you can narrow down your results\n- Find functions, variables or traits with symbol search\n- Precise code navigation (go-to-reference and go-to-definition) for 10+ of the most popular languages built with [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)\n- Privacy focussed on-device embedding for semantic search\n\nbloop stands on the shoulders of the Rust ecosystem. Our search indexes are powered by [Tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) and [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant), and our multi-platform app is built with [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri).\n\nhttps://github.com/BloopAI/bloop/assets/7957964/93715188-d8d5-477b-8cd1-95d9cbd368cb\n\n## Get Started\n\nThe simplest way to get started with bloop is to [download the app](https://github.com/BloopAI/bloop/releases) and follow the onboarding steps. Checkout our [getting started guide](https://bloop.ai/understand/docs/getting-started) and our references for [conversational](https://bloop.ai/understand/docs/natural-language-queries) and [regex](https://bloop.ai/understand/docs/regex-queries) search and [Code Studio](https://bloop.ai/understand/docs/code-studio).\n\nFor instructions on how to build from source or run bloop from the command line, check out these pages:\n\n- [Build bloop app from source](./apps/desktop/README.md)\n- [Run bloop from the command line](./server/README.md)\n\nIf you encounter any index issues you can wipe the bloop cache and reindex. Instructions on how to do this on different platforms [are here](./apps/desktop/README.md).\n\n## Building From Source\n\nYou can build bloop from source and run it with your own OpenAI API key. Clone the repo, make sure the `oss` branch is checked out, and create a file called `local_config.json` at the top-level of the repo. `local_config.json` should contain the following fields:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"github_access_token\": \"<YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>\",\n    \"openai_api_key\": \"<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>\"\n}\n```\n\nThen follow [these installation instructions](./apps/desktop/README.md). If built from source, bloop will not collect any telemetry. \n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/BloopAI/bloop)\n\n[![Open in Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/img/open-in-codeanywhere-btn.svg)](https://app.codeanywhere.com/#https://github.com/BloopAI/bloop)\n\nWe welcome contributions big and small! Before jumping in please read [our contributors guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [our code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nHere's how to find your way around the repo:\n\n- `apps/desktop`: The Tauri app\n- `server/bleep`: The Rust backend which contains the core search and navigation logic\n- `client`: The React frontend\n\nWe use Git LFS for dependencies that are expensive to build.\n\nTo make sure you have everything you need to start building, you'll need to\ninstall the `git-lfs` package for your favourite operating system, then run the\nfollowing commands in this repo:\n\n    git lfs install\n    git lfs pull\n\nIf you find a bug or have a feature request, [open an issue](https://github.com/BloopAI/bloop/issues)! You can find the application logs here:\n\n| OS      | Logs Path |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| MacOS      | `~/Library/Application\\ Support/ai.bloop.bloop/bleep/logs`       |\n| Windows   | `%APPDATA%/bloop/bleep/logs`        |\n| Linux   | `~/.local/share/bloop/bleep/logs`        |\n\n## Privacy\n\nWe store as little data as possible. We use telemetry to helps us identify bugs and make data-driven product decisions. You can read our full privacy policy [here](https://bloop.ai/privacy).\n\n## License\n\nbloop is licensed under the `Apache 2.0` license as defined in [LICENSE](./LICENSE).\n\n",
