It's meant to be 100% **predictable** and bring the benefits of tools coveted by professionals to everyone.\n\n## Spatial Model\n\nThis is the **core** of the **workflow** and what everything is built around and in our case it's one of the simplest: **a Grid**\n\n<p align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n\u00a0<img align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" src=\"./documentation/spatialisation.gif\"\n            alt=\"Spatialisation illustrated\">\n</p>\n\nA **Workspace** is an applications container that can be **visualized as a row** and **applications as cells**.\n\nEvery **new application** is **automatically positioned** inside this grid at the end of its workspace row and every **new workspaces** are **appended at the bottom** which is very **predictable** and **always sorted automatically**.\n\nThis allows us to provide **intuitive navigation** by moving the screen around a larger context. Navigating **up** and **down** will change the current workspace and navigating **left** and **right** changes the current window(s) on screen.\n\nYou can organize your applications by use cases as **activities** or by applications type as **categories**.\n\n## Interface\n\nDesigned to represent the **state** of the **workflow** and provide **navigation** capabilities for both a **mouse** and a **touchscreen**.\n\n### Layout\n\nThe interface is divided in **two parts**:\n\nIn the **left panel** everything pertains to the **system**: workspaces state, current system status, notifications, etc.\n\nOn the **right** of the left panel everything pertains to the **active workspace**: the windows on the workspace's row, the layout switcher, and the windows themselves.\n\n<p align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n\u00a0<img align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" src=\"./documentation/interface_showcase.gif\"\n            alt=\"Interface layout illustrated\">\n</p>\n\nThe two most important components are the **system panel** (on the left) and the **workspace panel** (on the top).\n\n#### System panel\n\nThe system panel is the main component of the left side of the interface. It consists of:\n\n-   **Workspace list and switcher**: This component lists all the workspaces available and the currently selected one. It allows us to navigate to a specific workspace by clicking on its icon.\n-   **System tray**: This component lists all the information about the system, e.g. network status, bluetooth connectivity, volume, battery, and notification icons.\n\n#### Workspace panel\n\nThe workspace panel is the main component of the right side of the interface. It consists of:\n\n-   **App switcher**: This component lists all the application windows opened in the current workspace's row and the currently focused one. It allows us to navigate to a specific window within the row by selecting its item.\n-   **Layout switcher**: This component displays the current layout of the workspace and can be clicked to switch to the next available layout.\n\n### Design\n\nMade by following the **[Material Design guidelines](https://material.io)** - a solid baseline that allows us to provide an **aesthetically pleasing** and **highly accessible** interface.\n\n### Themes\n\nYou can choose between 3 different themes:\n\n-   Dark\n-   Light\n-   Primary (Colorful one)\n\nAnd there is also a **blurry** version available for the more fancy ones !\n\n## Tiling engine\n\nIt's the **tool** that **automatically organize** the application's **window** for you in a **predictable** and mutually **non-overlapping** disposition.\n\n<p align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n\u00a0<img align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" src=\"./documentation/tiling_showcase.gif\"\n            alt=\"Tiling engine illustrated\">\n</p>\n\n**Choose** at **any time** which tiling layout suit the most for your need:\n\n-   **Maximize**: Single window at a time\n-   **Split**: 2 windows side by side\n-   **Simple**: All windows evenly split and stacked along horizontal or vertical axis (useful for ultra wide monitor)\n-   **Half**: One master window on the left then others windows stacked to the right\n-   **Grid**: All windows displayed as a grid\n\n## Persistence\n\nThe **best way** to **configure** the desktop layout is to **not** have to **do it**.\n\nMaterial Shell **keeps track** of every **decision** relative to the desktop layout: where are windows, in which workspaces, and in which order.\n\nThis allows **configuration** of the layouts **on the go** while using it.\n\nWhen opening a **new session** Material Shell will **restore every window** previously present with a \"**window placeholder** which allows you to reopen any of the previous windows easily at the same spot you like to have them.\n\n## Hotkeys\n\nSome hotkeys might already be used by GNOME Shell - please check your keybindings first.\n\n#### Desktop navigation\n\n-   `Super+W` Navigate to the upper workspace/category.\n-   `Super+S` Navigate to the lower workspace/category.\n-   `Super+A` Focus the window at the left of the current window.\n-   `Super+D` Focus the window at the right of the current window.\n-   `Super+1`, `Super+2` ... `Super+0` Navigate to specific workspace\n\n#### Window manipulation\n\n-   `Super+Q` Kill the current window focused.\n-   `Super+[MouseDrag]` Move window around.\n-   `Super+Shift+A` Move the current window to the left.\n-   `Super+Shift+D` Move the current window to the right.\n-   `Super+Shift+W` Move the current window to the upper workspace.\n-   `Super+Shift+S` Move the current window to the lower workspace.\n\n#### Extra Hotkeys\n\n-   `Super+Space` Cycle the tiling layout of the current workspace.\n-   `Super+Escape` Toggle the UI of Material-shell, like a Zen mode.\n\n# Installation\n\nYou can install the extension either using the gnome extensions website, or directly from source.\n\n## Get it in two clicks\n\n-   Navigate to [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3357/material-shell/)\n-   Switch the toggle ON\n\n## Get the most up to date version with Git\n\n1. Check your GNOME Shell version as we only support **gnome-shell >= 40.0**\n\n2. Download the extension. Depending on your distribution, there are several ways to acquire it:\n\n| Install via          | Command                                                                                                                 |\n| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| extensions.gnome.org | Navigate to [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3357/material-shell/) && switch the toggle ON |\n| source               | `git clone https://github.com/material-shell/material-shell.git && cd material-shell && make install`                   |\n\n(We appreciate package maintainers! If you would like to make a package available for your distro please submit a PR so it can be added here!)\n\n3. Reload GNOME Shell:\n    - On X.org: Hit `Alt+F2` and type the command `r`\n    - On Wayland: Log out and back in\n4. Open `gnome-tweaks` and activate the `Material Shell` extension **OR** enable it using\n\n```bash\ngnome-extensions enable material-shell@papyelgringo\n```\n\n## Recommended Additional Configuration\n\n-   GTK and GNOME Shell theme: [Plata Theme](https://gitlab.com/tista500/plata-theme)\n-   Icon theme: [Tela Icon Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Tela-icon-theme)\n\n## For Multi Monitor with different scaling factor to work properly\n\nYou need to enable Wayland Fractionnal Scaling capabilities with:\n\n```\ngsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features \"['scale-monitor-framebuffer']\"\n```\n\nNote that it current have the downside to make XWayland window to possibly become blurry\n\n# Reset Material Shell\n\n## Reset the Material Shell persistent state\n\nIf you have some weird behavior or a degradation over time, it can be a good idea to try to reset the Material Shell state.\n\n1. Open Looking Glass tool by pressing `Alt + F2` and type `lg`\n2. Copy and paste the command `global.set_persistent_state('material-shell-state',new GLib.Variant('s', '{}'));`\n3. Reload the shell by either pressing `Alt + F2` and type `r` (does not work on Wayland), or log out and then log in again.\n\n## Reset the Material Shell settings\n\nIf you want to discard all the changes of Material Shell settings and reset to default (Including keybindings)\n\n1. Open a terminal and copy/paste `dconf reset -f /org/gnome/shell/extensions/materialshell/`\n\n# Uninstallation \ud83d\ude22\n\nWe're sad to see you go. Before you uninstall, leave us some feedback by [opening an issue](https://github.com/material-shell/material-shell/issues/new/choose) - it will be very helpful in improving Material Shell.\n\n1. Open `gnome-tweaks` and disable the `Material Shell` extension **OR** disable it using\n\n```bash\ngnome-extensions disable material-shell@papyelgringo\n```\n\n2. Delete the extension directory.\n\n```bash\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/material-shell@papyelgringo\n```\n\nif you miss the minimize and maximize button on windows titlebar you can restore them with\n\n```bash\n/usr/bin/gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout :minimize,maximize,close\n```\n\n# History\n\nThe project is based on my earlier work on [Material Awesome](https://github.com/PapyElGringo/material-awesome).\n\n# Crypto Funding\n\nIf you interested in funding the project throught crypto feel free to use:\n\n**Bitcoin** `395nVybx6h6CC4sWgGGcvCDxwLvGMFhfiA`\n\n**Ethereum** `0x45360f24f03f2a8a964f7c083815336912cba837`\n\n**Monero** `82YGUymQLZ3cWPw2kEfjTphjUJLCN3M2eX3dPxRhrBeKSoUUoj4TEHAGToPoZA8AfhSGEKa9FdZjmGKAMSBxcrgHQMRZu3v`\n",
