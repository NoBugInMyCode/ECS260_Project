Unstable. Found under https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN\r\n2. Stable. Found under https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable\r\n\r\n\r\n# About HTML5-based Modern Admin Console and JSON-RPC API Suite\r\n\r\n## Built-in SoftEther VPN Server HTML5 Ajax-based Web Administration Console\r\nWe are developing the HTML5 Ajax-based Web Administration Console (currently very limited, under construction) in the embedded HTTPS server on the SoftEther VPN Server.\r\n\r\nAccess to the following URL from your favorite web browser.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://<vpn_server_hostname>:<port>/admin/\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example if your VPN Server is running as the port 5555 on the host at 192.168.0.1, you can access to the web console by:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://192.168.0.1:5555/admin/\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Your HTML5 development contribution is very appreciated. The current HTML5 pages are written by Daiyuu Nobori (the core developer of SoftEther VPN). He is obviously lack of HTML5 development ability. Please kindly consider to contribute for SoftEther VPN's development on GitHub. Your code will help every people running SoftEther VPN Server.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Built-in SoftEther Server VPN JSON-RPC API Suite\r\nThe API Suite allows you to easily develop your original SoftEther VPN Server management application to control the VPN Server (e.g. creating users, adding Virtual Hubs, disconnecting a specified VPN sessions).\r\n\r\nYou can access to the [latest SoftEther VPN Server JSON-RPC Document on GitHub.](https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/tree/master/developer_tools/vpnserver-jsonrpc-clients/)\r\n\r\n- Almost all control APIs, which the VPN Server provides, are available as JSON-RPC API.\r\nYou can write your own VPN Server management application in your favorite languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, Ruby, C#, ... etc.)\r\n- If you are planning to develop your own VPN cloud service, the JSON-RPC API is the best choice to realize the automated operations for the VPN Server.\r\n- No need to use any specific API client library since all APIs are provided on the JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification. You can use your favorite JSON and HTTPS client library to call any of all APIs in your pure runtime environment.\r\n- Also, the SoftEther VPN Project provides high-quality JSON-RPC client stub libraries which define all of the API client stub codes. These libraries are written in C#, JavaScript and TypeScript. The Node.js Client Library for VPN Server RPC (vpnrpc) package is also available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# TO CIRCUMVENT YOUR GOVERNMENT'S FIREWALL RESTRICTION\r\n\r\nBecause SoftEther VPN is overly strong tool to build a VPN tunnel,\r\nsome censorship governments want to block your access to the source code\r\nof SoftEther VPN, by abusing their censorship firewalls.\r\n\r\nTo circumvent your censor's unjust restriction,\r\nSoftEther VPN Project distributes the up-to-date source code\r\non all the following open-source repositories:\r\n\r\n  - GitHub\r\n    https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN\r\n\r\n        $ git clone https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN.git\r\n\r\n  - GitLab (mirrored from GitHub)\r\n    https://gitlab.com/SoftEther/VPN\r\n\r\n        $ git clone https://gitlab.com/SoftEther/VPN.git\r\n\r\n  - OneDev (mirrored from GitHub)\r\n    https://code.onedev.io/SoftEther/VPN\r\n\r\n        $ git clone https://code.onedev.io/SoftEther/VPN.git\r\n\r\nWe hope that you can reach one of the above URLs at least!\r\n\r\n\r\n# SOURCE CODE CONTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nYour contribution to SoftEther VPN Project is much appreciated.\r\nPlease send patches to us through GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n# DEAR SECURITY EXPERTS\r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or a security vulnerability please [kindly inform](https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/security/advisories/new) us\r\nabout the problem immediately so that we can fix the security problem\r\nto protect a lot of users around the world as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nOur e-mail address for security reports is:\r\n**softether-vpn-security at softether.org**\r\n\r\nPlease note that the above e-mail address is not a technical support\r\ninquiry address.
