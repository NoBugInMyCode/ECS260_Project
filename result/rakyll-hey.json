Using the same name was a mistake as it resulted in cases\nwhere binary name conflicts created confusion.\nTo preserve the name for its original owner, we renamed this project to hey.\n\n## Installation\n\n* Linux 64-bit: https://hey-release.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hey_linux_amd64\n* Mac 64-bit: https://hey-release.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hey_darwin_amd64\n* Windows 64-bit: https://hey-release.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hey_windows_amd64\n\n### Package Managers\n\nmacOS:\n-  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can use `brew install hey`.\n\n## Usage\n\nhey runs provided number of requests in the provided concurrency level and prints stats.\n\nIt also supports HTTP2 endpoints.\n\n```\nUsage: hey [options...] <url>\n\nOptions:\n  -n  Number of requests to run. Default is 200.\n  -c  Number of workers to run concurrently. Total number of requests cannot\n      be smaller than the concurrency level. Default is 50.\n  -q  Rate limit, in queries per second (QPS) per worker. Default is no rate limit.\n  -z  Duration of application to send requests. When duration is reached,\n      application stops and exits. If duration is specified, n is ignored.\n      Examples: -z 10s -z 3m.\n  -o  Output type. If none provided, a summary is printed.\n      \"csv\" is the only supported alternative. Dumps the response\n      metrics in comma-separated values format.\n\n  -m  HTTP method, one of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS.\n  -H  Custom HTTP header. You can specify as many as needed by repeating the flag.\n      For example, -H \"Accept: text/html\" -H \"Content-Type: application/xml\" .\n  -t  Timeout for each request in seconds. Default is 20, use 0 for infinite.\n  -A  HTTP Accept header.\n  -d  HTTP request body.\n  -D  HTTP request body from file. For example, /home/user/file.txt or ./file.txt.\n  -T  Content-type, defaults to \"text/html\".\n  -a  Basic authentication, username:password.\n  -x  HTTP Proxy address as host:port.\n  -h2 Enable HTTP/2.\n\n  -host\tHTTP Host header.\n\n  -disable-compression  Disable compression.\n  -disable-keepalive    Disable keep-alive, prevents re-use of TCP\n                        connections between different HTTP requests.\n  -disable-redirects    Disable following of HTTP redirects\n  -cpus                 Number of used cpu cores.\n                        (default for current machine is 8 cores)\n```\n\nPreviously known as [github.com/rakyll/boom](https://github.com/rakyll/boom).\n",
