In particular, the [Puzzles & Paradoxes series](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/eve-talk/Puzzles$20$26$20Paradoxes%7Csort:date) answers a lot of questions beginners face about the Eve langauge.\n\n## Get Involved\n\n### Join the Community\n\nThe Eve community is small but constantly growing, and everyone is welcome!\n\n- Join or start a discussion on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk).\n- Impact the future of Eve by getting involved with our [Request for Comments](https://github.com/witheve/rfcs) process.\n- Read our [development blog](http://incidentalcomplexity.com/).\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/with_eve).\n\n### How to Contribute\n\nThe best way to contribute right now is to write Eve code and report your experiences. [Let us know](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) what kind of programs you\u2019re trying to write, what barriers you are facing in writing code (both mental and technological), and any errors you encounter along the way.\n\n### How to File an Issue\n\nPlease file any issues in this repository. Before you file an issue, please take a look to see if the issue already exists. When you file an issue, please include:\n\n1. The steps needed to reproduce the bug\n2. Your operating system and browser.\n3. If applicable, the `.*eve` file that causes the bug.\n\n## License\n\nEve is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/witheve/eve/blob/master/LICENSE) for details.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nEve is currently at a very early, \"alpha\" stage of development. This means the language, tools, and docs are largely incomplete, but undergoing rapid and continuous development. If you encounter errors while using Eve, don't worry: it's likely our fault. Please bring the problem to our attention by [filing an issue](https://github.com/witheve/eve#how-to-file-an-issue).\n\nAs always, with pre-release software, don\u2019t use this for anything important. We are continuously pushing to this codebase, so you can expect very rapid changes. At this time, we\u2019re not prepared make the commitment that our changes will not break your code, but we\u2019ll do our best to [update you](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) on the biggest changes.\n",
