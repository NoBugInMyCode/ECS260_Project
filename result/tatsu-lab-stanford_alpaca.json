The repo contains:\n\n- The [52K data](#data-release) used for fine-tuning the model.\n- The code for [generating the data](#data-generation-process).\n- The code for [fine-tuning the model](#fine-tuning).\n- The code for [recovering Alpaca-7B weights from our released weight diff](#recovering-alpaca-weights).\n\nNote: We thank the community for feedback on Stanford-Alpaca and supporting our research. Our live demo is suspended until further notice.\n\n**Usage and License Notices**: Alpaca is intended and licensed for research use only. The dataset is CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use) and models trained using the dataset should not be used outside of research purposes. \nThe weight diff is also CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use).\n\n## Overview\n\nThe current Alpaca model is fine-tuned from a 7B LLaMA model [1] on 52K instruction-following data generated by the techniques in the Self-Instruct [2] paper, with some modifications that we discuss in the next section.\nIn a preliminary human evaluation, we found that the Alpaca 7B model behaves similarly to the `text-davinci-003` model on the Self-Instruct instruction-following evaluation suite [2].\n\nAlpaca is still under development, and there are many limitations that have to be addressed.\nImportantly, we have not yet fine-tuned the Alpaca model to be safe and harmless.\nWe thus encourage users to be cautious when interacting with Alpaca, and to report any concerning behavior to help improve the safety and ethical considerations of the model.\n\nOur initial release contains the data generation procedure, dataset, and training recipe. We intend to release the model weights if we are given permission to do so by the creators of LLaMA. For now, we have chosen to host a live demo to help readers better understand the capabilities and limits of Alpaca, as well as a way to help us better evaluate Alpaca's performance on a broader audience.\n\n**Please read our release [blog post](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) for more details about the model, our discussion of the potential harm and limitations of Alpaca models, and our thought process for releasing a reproducible model.**\n\n[1]: LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models.

Each of the 52K instructions is unique.\n- `input`: `str`, optional context or input for the task. For example, when the instruction is \"Summarize the following article\", the input is the article. Around 40% of the examples have an input.\n- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by `text-davinci-003`.\n\nWe used the following prompts for fine-tuning the Alpaca model:\n\n- for examples with a non-empty input field:\n\n ```\n Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n \n ### Instruction:\n {instruction}\n \n ### Input:\n {input}\n \n ### Response:\n ```\n\n- for examples with an empty input field:\n\n ```\n Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n \n ### Instruction:\n {instruction}\n \n ### Response:\n ```\n\n During inference (eg for the web demo), we use the user instruction with an empty input field (second option).\n\n## Data Generation Process\n\n<details>\n<summary> <strong> Running the code </strong> </summary>\n\n1. Set environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key.\n2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n3. Run `python -m generate_instruction generate_instruction_following_data` to generate the data.\n\n</details>\n\nWe built on the data generation pipeline from [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct) and made the following modifications:\n\n- We used `text-davinci-003` to generate the instruction data instead of `davinci`.\n- We wrote a new prompt (`prompt.txt`) that explicitly gave the requirement of instruction generation to `text-davinci-003`. Note: there is a slight error in the prompt we used, and future users should incorporate the edit in <https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/pull/24>\n- We adopted much more aggressive batch decoding, i.e., generating 20 instructions at once, which significantly reduced the cost of data generation.\n- We simplified the data generation pipeline by discarding the difference between classification and non-classification instructions.\n- We only generated a single instance for each instruction, instead of 2 to 3 instances as in [1].\n\nThis produced an instruction-following dataset with 52K examples obtained at a much lower cost (less than $500).\nIn a preliminary study, we also find our 52K generated data to be much more diverse than the data released by [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/data/seed_tasks.jsonl).\nWe plot the below figure (in the style of Figure 2 in the [self-instruct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) to demonstrate the diversity of our data.\nThe inner circle of the plot represents the root verb of the instructions, and the outer circle represents the direct objects.\n\n[//]: # (![parse_analysis]&#40;assert/parse_analysis.png | width=100&#41;)\n[<img src=\"assets/parse_analysis.png\" width=\"750\" />](./assets/parse_analysis.png)\n\n## Fine-tuning\n\nWe fine-tune our models using standard Hugging Face training code.\nWe fine-tune LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B with the following hyperparameters:\n\n| Hyperparameter | LLaMA-7B | LLaMA-13B |\n|----------------|----------|-----------|\n| Batch size     | 128      | 128       |\n| Learning rate  | 2e-5     | 1e-5      |\n| Epochs         | 3        | 5         |\n| Max length     | 512      | 512       |\n| Weight decay   | 0        | 0         |\n\nTo reproduce our fine-tuning runs for LLaMA, first install the requirements\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nBelow is a command that fine-tunes LLaMA-7B with our dataset on a machine with 4 A100 80G GPUs in FSDP `full_shard` mode.\nWe were able to reproduce a model of similar quality as the one we hosted in our demo with the following command using **Python 3.10**.\nReplace `<your_random_port>` with a port of your own, `<your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer>` with the\npath to your converted checkpoint and tokenizer (following instructions in the PR), and `<your_output_dir>` with where you want to store your outputs.\n\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \\\n    --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \\\n    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\\n    --bf16 True \\\n    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \\\n    --num_train_epochs 3 \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\\n    --evaluation_strategy \"no\" \\\n    --save_strategy \"steps\" \\\n    --save_steps 2000 \\\n    --save_total_limit 1 \\\n    --learning_rate 2e-5 \\\n    --weight_decay 0. \\\n    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\\n    --lr_scheduler_type \"cosine\" \\\n    --logging_steps 1 \\\n    --fsdp \"full_shard auto_wrap\" \\\n    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'LlamaDecoderLayer' \\\n    --tf32 True\n```\n\nThe same script also works for OPT fine-tuning. Here's an example for fine-tuning OPT-6.7B\n\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \\\n    --model_name_or_path \"facebook/opt-6.7b\" \\\n    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\\n    --bf16 True \\\n    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \\\n    --num_train_epochs 3 \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\\n    --evaluation_strategy \"no\" \\\n    --save_strategy \"steps\" \\\n    --save_steps 2000 \\\n    --save_total_limit 1 \\\n    --learning_rate 2e-5 \\\n    --weight_decay 0. \\\n    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\\n    --lr_scheduler_type \"cosine\" \\\n    --logging_steps 1 \\\n    --fsdp \"full_shard auto_wrap\" \\\n    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'OPTDecoderLayer' \\\n    --tf32 True\n```\n\nNote the given training script is meant to be simple and easy to use, and is not particularly optimized.\nTo run on more gpus, you may prefer to turn down `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep a global batch size of 128. Global batch size has not been tested for optimality.\n\n### Addressing OOM\n\nNaively, fine-tuning a 7B model requires about 7 x 4 x 4 = 112 GB of VRAM. Commands given above enable parameter sharding, so no redundant model copy is stored on any GPU.\nIf you'd like to further reduce the memory footprint, here are some options:\n\n- Turn on CPU offload for FSDP with `--fsdp \"full_shard auto_wrap offload\"`. This saves VRAM at the cost of longer runtime.\n- In our experience, DeepSpeed stage-3 (with offload) can at times be more memory efficient than FSDP with offload. Here's an example to use DeepSpeed stage-3 with 4 GPUs with both parameter and optimizer offload:\n    ```bash\n    pip install deepspeed\n    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \\\n        --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \\\n        --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\\n        --bf16 True \\\n        --output_dir <your_output_dir> \\\n        --num_train_epochs 3 \\\n        --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\\n        --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\\n        --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\\n        --evaluation_strategy \"no\" \\\n        --save_strategy \"steps\" \\\n        --save_steps 2000 \\\n        --save_total_limit 1 \\\n        --learning_rate 2e-5 \\\n        --weight_decay 0. \\\n        --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\\n        --deepspeed \"./configs/default_offload_opt_param.json\" \\\n        --tf32 True\n    ```\n  - The DeepSpeed library also provides some [helpful functions](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memory.html) to estimate memory usage. \n- [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) fine-tunes low-rank slices of the query, key, and value embedding heads. This can reduce the total memory footprint from 112GB to about 7x4=28GB. We may release our re-implemention of this in the future, but for now the [peft](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) codebase can be a useful resource.\n\n## Recovering Alpaca Weights\n\nThe weight diff between Alpaca-7B and LLaMA-7B is located [here](https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b-wdiff/tree/main).\nTo recover the original Alpaca-7B weights, follow these steps:\n```text\n1. Convert Meta's released weights into huggingface format. Follow this guide:\n    https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama\n2. Make sure you cloned the released weight diff into your local machine. The weight diff is located at:\n    https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b/tree/main\n3. Run this function with the correct paths. E.g.,\n    python weight_diff.py recover --path_raw <path_to_step_1_dir> --path_diff <path_to_step_2_dir> --path_tuned <path_to_store_recovered_weights>\n```\n\nOnce step 3 completes, you should have a directory with the recovered weights, from which you can load the model like the following\n\n```python\nimport transformers\nalpaca_model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"<path_to_store_recovered_weights>\")\nalpaca_tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"<path_to_store_recovered_weights>\")\n```\n\n### Authors\n\nAll grad students below contributed equally and the order is determined by random draw.\n\n- [Rohan Taori](https://www.rohantaori.com/)\n- [Ishaan Gulrajani](https://ishaan.io/)\n- [Tianyi Zhang](https://tiiiger.github.io/)\n- [Yann Dubois](https://yanndubs.github.io/)\n- [Xuechen Li](https://www.lxuechen.com/)\n\nAll advised by [Tatsunori B.
