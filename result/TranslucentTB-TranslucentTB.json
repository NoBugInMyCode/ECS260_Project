Windows 10 and Windows 11 build 22000 only.\n  - **Acrylic**: Will give the taskbar an appearance similar to Microsoft's Fluent Design guidelines.\n- **Dynamic** modes (these can be used together and each of them provides a taskbar state and color you can customize):\n  - **Visible window**: Will change the taskbar to a different appearance if a window is currently open on the desktop.\n  - **Maximized window**: Will change the taskbar to a different appearance if a window is currently maximised.\n  - **Start opened**: Will change the taskbar appearance when the start menu is opened.\n  - **Search opened**: Will change the taskbar appearance when the search menu (previously Cortana) is open.\n  - **Task View opened**: Will change the taskbar apperance when the Task View (previously Timeline) is open.\n- On Windows 10, ability to **show or hide the Aero Peek button** depending on the currently active dynamic mode.\n- On Windows 11, ability to **show or hide the taskbar line** depending on the currently active dynamic mode.\n- Compatible with [RoundedTB](https://github.com/torchgm/RoundedTB)!\n- Compatible with [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher)!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QbG7KQA.png\" alt=\"windows 11 acrylic\" width=\"243\"> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zabZ52s.png\" alt=\"windows 11 clear\" width=\"243\">\n\n![windows 10 acrylic](https://i.imgur.com/M15IPJW.png) ![windows 10 clear](https://i.imgur.com/eLGTtwp.png) ![windows 10 blur](https://i.imgur.com/r4ZJjnL.png)\n\n## Download\n\n[<img src=\"https://get.microsoft.com/images/en-us%20dark.svg\" alt=\"Get it from Microsoft\" height=\"104\">](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9PF4KZ2VN4W9)\n\nYou can download the program for free from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PF4KZ2VN4W9) and take advantage of its features like background auto-updates.\n\nAlternatively, you can download `TranslucentTB.appinstaller` [via the releases tab](https://github.com/TranslucentTB/TranslucentTB/releases) and open it to install the app.\n\nA portable version of the app is also available [on GitHub releases](https://github.com/TranslucentTB/TranslucentTB/releases) as `TranslucentTB.zip`, but this version only works on Windows 11.\n\nIf you want to get the latest bleeding edge build, you can grab it over at the [Azure Pipelines page](https://dev.azure.com/sylve0n/TranslucentTB/_build?definitionId=4). Note that these builds may not work, or include features that are partially complete. Use at your own risk.\n\n## Add to Startup\n\nTo add TranslucentTB to startup, check the \"Open at boot\" entry in the TranslucentTB tray icon's context menu. If you are having issues or the entry in the context menu is grayed out, try applying the following registry changes:\n```reg\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System]\n\"EnableFullTrustStartupTasks\"=dword:00000002\n\"EnableUwpStartupTasks\"=dword:00000002\n\"SupportFullTrustStartupTasks\"=dword:00000001\n\"SupportUwpStartupTasks\"=dword:00000001\n```\n\nPortable versions can be added to startup by creating a shortcut to the executable in `%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup`.\n\n## Donations and contributions\n\n[We have a Liberapay!](https://liberapay.com/TranslucentTB/) Don't hesitate to donate if you appreciate TranslucentTB and would like to support our work.\n\nIf you want to contribute to the source code, we have [a how-to contribute guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Security\n\nSome antiviruses are over eager, so they might flag this program as malicious.
