Awesome! We are always happy about new\ncontributions (e.g. elaboration or corrections on certain topics) to this\nproject.\n\nYou can check the\n[Umbrella issue](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns/issues/116) for all\nthe patterns, anti-patterns, and idioms that could be added.\n\nWe suggest reading our [Contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get more\ninformation on how contributing to this repository works.\n\n## Building with mdbook\n\nThis book is built with [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). You can\ninstall it by running `cargo install mdbook`.\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n- `cargo install mdbook-last-changed` for date changes in the footer\n\n- `cargo install mdbook-pandoc` for rendering the book to PDF\n\n- `cargo install mdbook-i18n-helpers` for translation and i8n support\n\n#### Texlive\n\n```sh\n# Source the .env file to get the PANDOC_VERSION\n. ./.env\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install -y texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-luatex texlive-lang-cjk librsvg2-bin fonts-noto\n\ncurl -LsSf https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/$PANDOC_VERSION/pandoc-$PANDOC_VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar zxf -\n```\n\n### Building the book\n\nIf you want to build it locally you can run one of these two commands in the\nroot directory of the repository:\n\n- `mdbook build`\n\n  Builds static html pages as output and place them in the `/book` directory by\n  default.\n\n- `mdbook serve`\n\n  Serves the book at `http://localhost:3000` (port is changeable, take a look at\n  the terminal output to be sure) and reloads the browser when a change occurs.\n\n## License\n\nThe content of this repository is licensed under **MPL-2.0**; see\n[LICENSE](./LICENSE).\n",
