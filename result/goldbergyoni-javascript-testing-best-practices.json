One should look at a test and get the intent instantly.\n\nSee, our minds are already occupied with our main job - the production code. There is no 'headspace' for additional complexity. Should we try to squeeze yet another sus-system into our poor brain it will slow the team down which works against the reason we do testing. Practically this is where many teams just abandon testing.\n\nThe tests are an opportunity for something else - a friendly assistant, co-pilot, that delivers great value for a small investment. Science tells us that we have two brain systems: system 1 is used for effortless activities like driving a car on an empty road and system 2 is meant for complex and conscious operations like solving a math equation. Design your test for system 1, when looking at test code it should _feel_ as easy as modifying an HTML document and not like solving 2X(17 \u00d7 24).\n\nThis can be achieved by selectively cherry-picking techniques, tools, and test targets that are cost-effective and provide great ROI. Test only as much as needed, and strive to keep it nimble, sometimes it's even worth dropping some tests and trading reliability for agility and simplicity.\n\n![alt text](/assets/headspace.png \"We have no head room for additional complexity\")\n\nMost of the advice below are derivatives of this principle.\n\n### Ready to start?\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Section 1: The Test Anatomy\n\n<br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 1.1 Include 3 parts in each test name\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** A test report should tell whether the current application revision satisfies the requirements for the people who are not necessarily familiar with the code: the tester, the DevOps engineer who is deploying and the future you two years from now. This can be achieved best if the tests speak at the requirements level and include 3 parts:\n\n(1) What is being tested? For example, the ProductsService.addNewProduct method\n\n(2) Under what circumstances and scenario? For example, no price is passed to the method\n\n(3) What is the expected result? For example, the new product is not approved\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** A deployment just failed, a test named \u201cAdd product\u201d failed. Does this tell you what exactly is malfunctioning?\n\n<br/>\n\n**\ud83d\udc47 Note:** Each bullet has code examples and sometime also an image illustration.

Following this structure guarantees that the reader spends no brain-CPU on understanding the test plan:\n\n1st A - Arrange: All the setup code to bring the system to the scenario the test aims to simulate. This might include instantiating the unit under test constructor, adding DB records, mocking/stubbing on objects, and any other preparation code\n\n2nd A - Act: Execute the unit under test. Usually 1 line of code\n\n3rd A - Assert: Ensure that the received value satisfies the expectation. Usually 1 line of code\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Not only do you spend hours understanding the main code but what should have been the simplest part of the day (testing) stretches your brain\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: A test structured with the AAA pattern\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20Jest-blue.svg \"Examples with Jest\") ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20Mocha-blue.svg \"Examples with Mocha\")\n\n```javascript\ndescribe(\"Customer classifier\", () => {\n  test(\"When customer spent more than 500$, should be classified as premium\", () => {\n    //Arrange\n    const customerToClassify = { spent: 505, joined: new Date(), id: 1 };\n    const DBStub = sinon.stub(dataAccess, \"getCustomer\").reply({ id: 1, classification: \"regular\" });\n\n    //Act\n    const receivedClassification = customerClassifier.classifyCustomer(customerToClassify);\n\n    //Assert\n    expect(receivedClassification).toMatch(\"premium\");\n  });\n});\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: No separation, one bulk, harder to interpret\n\n```javascript\ntest(\"Should be classified as premium\", () => {\n  const customerToClassify = { spent: 505, joined: new Date(), id: 1 };\n  const DBStub = sinon.stub(dataAccess, \"getCustomer\").reply({ id: 1, classification: \"regular\" });\n  const receivedClassification = customerClassifier.classifyCustomer(customerToClassify);\n  expect(receivedClassification).toMatch(\"premium\");\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f1.3 Describe expectations in a product language: use BDD-style assertions\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Coding your tests in a declarative-style allows the reader to get the grab instantly without spending even a single brain-CPU cycle. When you write imperative code that is packed with conditional logic, the reader is forced to exert more brain-CPU cycles. In that case, code the expectation in a human-like language, declarative BDD style using `expect` or `should` and not using custom code. If Chai & Jest doesn't include the desired assertion and it\u2019s highly repeatable, consider [extending Jest matcher (Jest)](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#expectextendmatchers) or writing a [custom Chai plugin](https://www.chaijs.com/guide/plugins/)\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** The team will write less tests and decorate the annoying ones with .skip()\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary><br/>\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20Mocha-blue.svg \"Examples with Mocha & Chai\") ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20Jest-blue.svg \"Examples with Jest\")\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: The reader must skim through not so short, and imperative code just to get the test story\n\n```javascript\ntest(\"When asking for an admin, ensure only ordered admins in results\", () => {\n  //assuming we've added here two admins \"admin1\", \"admin2\" and \"user1\"\n  const allAdmins = getUsers({ adminOnly: true });\n\n  let admin1Found,\n    adming2Found = false;\n\n  allAdmins.forEach(aSingleUser => {\n    if (aSingleUser === \"user1\") {\n      assert.notEqual(aSingleUser, \"user1\", \"A user was found and not admin\");\n    }\n    if (aSingleUser === \"admin1\") {\n      admin1Found = true;\n    }\n    if (aSingleUser === \"admin2\") {\n      admin2Found = true;\n    }\n  });\n\n  if (!admin1Found || !admin2Found) {\n    throw new Error(\"Not all admins were returned\");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Skimming through the following declarative test is a breeze\n\n```javascript\nit(\"When asking for an admin, ensure only ordered admins in results\", () => {\n  //assuming we've added here two admins\n  const allAdmins = getUsers({ adminOnly: true });\n\n  expect(allAdmins)\n    .to.include.ordered.members([\"admin1\", \"admin2\"])\n    .but.not.include.ordered.members([\"user1\"]);\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 1.4 Stick to black-box testing: Test only public methods\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Testing the internals brings huge overhead for almost nothing. If your code/API delivers the right results, should you really invest your next 3 hours in testing HOW it worked internally and then maintain these fragile tests? Whenever a public behavior is checked, the private implementation is also implicitly tested and your tests will break only if there is a certain problem (e.g. wrong output). This approach is also referred to as `behavioral testing`. On the other side, should you test the internals (white box approach)\u200a\u2014\u200ayour focus shifts from planning the component outcome to nitty-gritty details and your test might break because of minor code refactors although the results are fine - this dramatically increases the maintenance burden\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Your tests behave like the [boy who cried wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf): shouting false-positive cries (e.g., A test fails because a private variable name was changed). Unsurprisingly, people will soon start to ignore the CI notifications until someday, a real bug gets ignored\u2026\n\n<br/>\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: A test case is testing the internals for no good reason\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20Mocha-blue.svg \"Examples with Mocha & Chai\")\n\n```javascript\nclass ProductService {\n  //this method is only used internally\n  //Change this name will make the tests fail\n  calculateVATAdd(priceWithoutVAT) {\n    return { finalPrice: priceWithoutVAT * 1.2 };\n    //Change the result format or key name above will make the tests fail\n  }\n  //public method\n  getPrice(productId) {\n    const desiredProduct = DB.getProduct(productId);\n    const finalPrice = this.calculateVATAdd(desiredProduct.price).finalPrice;\n    return finalPrice;\n  }\n}\n\nit(\"White-box test: When the internal methods get 0 vat, it return 0 response\", async () => {\n  //There's no requirement to allow users to calculate the VAT, only show the final price. Nevertheless we falsely insist here to test the class internals\n  expect(new ProductService().calculateVATAdd(0).finalPrice).to.equal(0);\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f \ufe0f1.5 Choose the right test doubles: Avoid mocks in favor of stubs and spies\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Test doubles are a necessary evil because they are coupled to the application internals, yet some provide immense value (<a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html\" data-href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[Read here a reminder about test doubles: mocks vs stubs vs spies](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)</a>).\n\nBefore using test doubles, ask a very simple question: Do I use it to test functionality that appears, or could appear, in the requirements document? If not, it\u2019s a white-box testing smell.\n\nFor example, if you want to test that your app behaves reasonably when the payment service is down, you might stub the payment service and trigger some \u2018No Response\u2019 return to ensure that the unit under test returns the right value. This checks our application behavior/response/outcome under certain scenarios. You might also use a spy to assert that an email was sent when that service is down\u200a\u2014\u200athis is again a behavioral check which is likely to appear in a requirements doc (\u201cSend an email if payment couldn\u2019t be saved\u201d). On the flip side, if you mock the Payment service and ensure that it was called with the right JavaScript types\u200a\u2014\u200athen your test is focused on internal things that have nothing to do with the application functionality and are likely to change frequently\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Any refactoring of code mandates searching for all the mocks in the code and updating accordingly. Tests become a burden rather than a helpful friend\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti-pattern example: Mocks focus on the internals\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20Sinon-blue.svg \"Examples with Sinon\")\n\n```javascript\nit(\"When a valid product is about to be deleted, ensure data access DAL was called once, with the right product and right config\", async () => {\n  //Assume we already added a product\n  const dataAccessMock = sinon.mock(DAL);\n  //hmmm BAD: testing the internals is actually our main goal here, not just a side-effect\n  dataAccessMock\n    .expects(\"deleteProduct\")\n    .once()\n    .withArgs(DBConfig, theProductWeJustAdded, true, false);\n  new ProductService().deletePrice(theProductWeJustAdded);\n  dataAccessMock.verify();\n});\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap:Doing It Right Example: spies are focused on testing the requirements but as a side-effect are unavoidably touching to the internals\n\n```javascript\nit(\"When a valid product is about to be deleted, ensure an email is sent\", async () => {\n  //Assume we already added here a product\n  const spy = sinon.spy(Emailer.prototype, \"sendEmail\");\n  new ProductService().deletePrice(theProductWeJustAdded);\n  //hmmm OK: we deal with internals? Yes, but as a side effect of testing the requirements (sending an email)\n  expect(spy.calledOnce).to.be.true;\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \ud83d\udcd7 Want to learn all these practices with live video?\n\n### Visit my online course [Testing Node.js & JavaScript From A To Z](https://www.testjavascript.com)\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f1.6 Don\u2019t \u201cfoo\u201d, use realistic input data\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Often production bugs are revealed under some very specific and surprising input\u200a\u2014\u200athe more realistic the test input is, the greater the chances are to catch bugs early. Use dedicated libraries like [Chance](https://github.com/chancejs/chancejs) or [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) to generate pseudo-real data that resembles the variety and form of production data. For example, such libraries can generate realistic phone numbers, usernames, credit cards, company names, and even \u2018lorem ipsum\u2019 text. You may also create some tests (on top of unit tests, not as a replacement) that randomize fakers' data to stretch your unit under test or even import real data from your production environment.

Even when the input format resembles real-world data (see bullet [\u2018Don\u2019t foo\u2019](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices#-%EF%B8%8F16-dont-foo-use-realistic-input-data)), we cover only a few input combinations (method(\u2018\u2019, true, 1), method(\u201cstring\u201d , false , 0)), However, in production, an API that is called with 5 parameters can be invoked with thousands of different permutations, one of them might render our process down ([see Fuzz Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)). What if you could write a single test that sends 1000 permutations of different inputs automatically and catches for which input our code fails to return the right response? Property-based testing is a technique that does exactly that: sending all the possible input combinations to your unit under test it increases the serendipity of finding a bug. For example, given a method\u200a\u2014\u200aaddNewProduct(id, name, isDiscount)\u200a\u2014\u200athe supporting libraries will call this method with many combinations of (number, string, boolean) like (1, \u201ciPhone\u201d, false), (2, \u201cGalaxy\u201d, true). You can run property-based testing using your favorite test runner (Mocha, Jest, etc) using libraries like [js-verify](https://github.com/jsverify/jsverify) or [testcheck](https://github.com/leebyron/testcheck-js) (much better documentation). Update: Nicolas Dubien suggests in the comments below to [checkout fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check#readme) which seems to offer some additional features and also to be actively maintained\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Unconsciously, you choose the test inputs that cover only code paths that work well.

Keeping this guideline will ensure your tests remain self-explanatory and less fragile.\n\nOn the other hand, \u2018classic snapshots\u2019 tutorials and tools encourage storing big files (e.g. component rendering markup, API JSON result) over some external medium and ensure each time when the test runs to compare the received result with the saved version. This, for example, can implicitly couple our test to 1000 lines with 3000 data values that the test writer never read and reasoned about. Why is this wrong? By doing so, there are 1000 reasons for your test to fail - it\u2019s enough for a single line to change for the snapshot to get invalid and this is likely to happen a lot. How frequently? for every space, comment, or minor CSS/HTML change. Not only this, the test name wouldn\u2019t give a clue about the failure as it just checks that 1000 lines didn\u2019t change, also it encourages the test writer to accept as the desired true a long document he couldn\u2019t inspect and verify. All of these are symptoms of obscure and eager test that is not focused and aims to achieve too much\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there are few cases where long & external snapshots are acceptable - when asserting on schema and not data (extracting out values and focusing on fields) or when the received document rarely changes\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** A UI test fails.

As an example, consider a test that should factor 100 lines of input JSON\u200a-\u200aPasting this in every test is tedious. Extracting it outside to transferFactory.getJSON() will leave the test vague\u200a-\u200aWithout data, it's hard to correlate the test result with the cause (\"why is it supposed to return 400 status?\"). The classic book x-unit patterns named this pattern 'the mystery guest'\u200a-\u200aSomething unseen affected our test results, we don't know what exactly. We can do better by extracting repeatable long parts outside AND mentioning explicitly which specific details matter to the test. Going with the example above, the test can pass parameters that highlight what is important: transferFactory.getJSON({sender: undefined}). In this example, the reader should immediately infer that the empty sender field is the reason why the test should expect a validation error or any other similar adequate outcome.\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Copying 500 JSON lines in will leave your tests unmaintainable and unreadable.

A common method for this is by placing at least 2 'describe' blocks above your tests: the 1st is for the name of the unit under test and the 2nd for an additional level of categorization like the scenario or custom categories (see code examples and the print screen below). Doing so will also greatly improve the test reports: The reader will easily infer the test categories, delve into the desired section and correlate failing tests. In addition, it will get much easier for a developer to navigate through the code of a suite with many tests. There are multiple alternative structures for the test suite that you may consider like [given-when-then](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-given) and [RITE](https://github.com/ericelliott/riteway)\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** When looking at a report with a flat and long list of tests, the reader has to skim-read through long texts to conclude the major scenarios and correlate the commonality of failing tests. Consider the following case: When 7/100 tests fail, looking at a flat list will demand reading the text of the failing to see how they relate to each other.

Consider writing the tests before the code in a [red-green-refactor style](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html), ensure each test checks exactly one thing, when you find a bug\u200a\u2014\u200abefore fixing write a test that will detect this bug in the future, and let each test fail at least once before turning green, start a module by writing a quick and simplistic code that satisfies the test - then refactor gradually and take it to a production grade level, avoid any dependency on the environment (paths, OS, etc)\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** You\u2018ll miss pearls of wisdom that were collected for decades\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Section 2\ufe0f\u20e3: Backend Testing\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f2.1 Enrich your testing portfolio: Look beyond unit tests and the pyramid\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** The [testing pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html), though 10> years old, is a great and relevant model that suggests three testing types and influences most developers\u2019 testing strategies. At the same time, more than a handful of shiny new testing techniques emerged and are hiding in the shadows of the testing pyramid. Given all the dramatic changes that we\u2019ve seen in the recent 10 years (Microservices, cloud, serverless), is it even possible that one quite-old model will suit *all* types of applications? shouldn\u2019t the testing world consider welcoming new testing techniques?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, in 2019 the testing pyramid, TDD, and unit tests are still a powerful technique and are probably the best match for many applications. Only like any other model, despite its usefulness, [it must be wrong sometimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong). For example, consider an IoT application that ingests many events into a message-bus like Kafka/RabbitMQ, which then flow into some data-warehouse and are eventually queried by some analytics UI. Should we really spend 50% of our testing budget on writing unit tests for an application that is integration-centric and has almost no logic? As the diversity of application types increases (bots, crypto, Alexa-skills) greater are the chances to find scenarios where the testing pyramid is not the best match.\n\nIt\u2019s time to enrich your testing portfolio and become familiar with more testing types (the next bullets suggest a few ideas), mind models like the testing pyramid but also match testing types to real-world problems that you\u2019re facing (\u2018Hey, our API is broken, let\u2019s write consumer-driven contract testing!\u2019), diversify your tests like an investor that builds a portfolio based on risk analysis\u200a\u2014\u200aassess where problems might arise and match some prevention measures to mitigate those potential risks\n\nA word of caution: the TDD argument in the software world takes a typical false-dichotomy face, some preach to use it everywhere, and others think it\u2019s the devil.

There is a spectrum of techniques that can mitigate the contract problem, some are simple, other are more feature-rich and demand a steeper learning curve. In a simple and recommended approach, the API provider publishes npm package with the API typing (e.g. JSDoc, TypeScript). Then the consumers can fetch this library and benefit from codign time intellisense and validation. A fancier approach is to use [PACT](https://docs.pact.io/) which was born to formalize this process with a very disruptive approach\u200a\u2014\u200anot the server defines the test plan itself rather the client defines the tests of the\u2026 server!

Both reasons are wrong\u200a\u2014\u200aMiddlewares are small but affect all or most of the requests and can be tested easily as pure functions that get {req,res} JS objects.

For example, it can assert whether the http status that was set on the res object matches the expectation (See example below)\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** A bug in Express middleware === a bug in all or most requests\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap:Doing It Right Example: Testing middleware in isolation without issuing network calls and waking-up the entire Express machine\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20Jest-blue.svg \"Examples with Jest\")\n\n```javascript\n//the middleware we want to test\nconst unitUnderTest = require(\"./middleware\");\nconst httpMocks = require(\"node-mocks-http\");\n//Jest syntax, equivelant to describe() & it() in Mocha\ntest(\"A request without authentication header, should return http status 403\", () => {\n  const request = httpMocks.createRequest({\n    method: \"GET\",\n    url: \"/user/42\",\n    headers: {\n      authentication: \"\"\n    }\n  });\n  const response = httpMocks.createResponse();\n  unitUnderTest(request, response);\n  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(403);\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f2.5 Measure and refactor using static analysis tools\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Using static analysis tools helps by giving objective ways to improve code quality and keep your code maintainable. You can add static analysis tools to your CI build to abort when it finds code smells. Its main selling points over plain linting are the ability to inspect quality in the context of multiple files (e.g. detect duplications), perform advanced analysis (e.g. code complexity) and follow the history and progress of code issues. Two examples of tools you can use are [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) (4,900+ [stars](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube)) and [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) (2,000+ [stars](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate))\n\nCredit: <a href=\"https://github.com/TheHollidayInn\" data-href=\"https://github.com/TheHollidayInn\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[Keith Holliday](https://github.com/TheHollidayInn)</a>\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** With poor code quality, bugs and performance will always be an issue that no shiny new library or state of the art features can fix\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: CodeClimate, a commercial tool that can identify complex methods:\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20Code%20Climate-blue.svg \"Examples with CodeClimate\")\n\n![alt text](assets/bp-16-yoni-goldberg-quality.png \"CodeClimate, a commercial tool that can identify complex methods:\")\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 2.6 Check your readiness for Node-related chaos\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Weirdly, most software testings are about logic & data only, but some of the worst things that happen (and are really hard to mitigate) are infrastructural issues. For example, did you ever test what happens when your process memory is overloaded, or when the server/process dies, or does your monitoring system realizes when the API becomes 50% slower?. To test and mitigate these type of bad things\u200a\u2014\u200a[Chaos engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) was born by Netflix. It aims to provide awareness, frameworks and tools for testing our app resiliency for chaotic issues. For example, one of its famous tools, [the chaos monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey), randomly kills servers to ensure that our service can still serve users and not relying on a single server (there is also a Kubernetes version, [kube-monkey](https://github.com/asobti/kube-monkey), that kills pods). All these tools work on the hosting/platform level, but what if you wish to test and generate pure Node chaos like check how your Node process copes with uncaught errors, unhandled promise rejection, v8 memory overloaded with the max allowed of 1.7GB or whether your UX remains satisfactory when the event loop gets blocked often? to address this I\u2019ve written, [node-chaos](https://github.com/i0natan/node-chaos-monkey) (alpha) which provides all sort of Node-related chaotic acts\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** No escape here, Murphy\u2019s law will hit your production without mercy\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: : Node-chaos can generate all sort of Node.js pranks so you can test how resilience is your app to chaos\n\n![alt text](assets/bp-17-yoni-goldberg-chaos-monkey-nodejs.png \"Node-chaos can generate all sort of Node.js pranks so you can test how resilience is your app to chaos\")\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f2.7 Avoid global test fixtures and seeds, add data per-test\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Going by the golden rule (bullet 0), each test should add and act on its own set of DB rows to prevent coupling and easily reason about the test flow. In reality, this is often violated by testers who seed the DB with data before running the tests (also known as \u2018test fixture\u2019) for the sake of performance improvement. While performance is indeed a valid concern\u200a\u2014\u200ait can be mitigated (see \u201cComponent testing\u201d bullet), however, test complexity is a much painful sorrow that should govern other considerations most of the time. Practically, make each test case explicitly add the DB records it needs and act only on those records. If performance becomes a critical concern\u200a\u2014\u200aa balanced compromise might come in the form of seeding the only suite of tests that are not mutating data (e.g. queries)\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Few tests fail, a deployment is aborted, our team is going to spend precious time now, do we have a bug? let\u2019s investigate, oh no\u200a\u2014\u200ait seems that two tests were mutating the same seed data\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: tests are not independent and rely on some global hook to feed global DB data\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20Mocha-blue.svg \"Examples with Mocha\")\n\n```javascript\nbefore(async () => {\n  //adding sites and admins data to our DB.

The two most viable options are cleaning after all the tests vs cleaning after every single test. Choosing the latter option, cleaning after every single test guarantees clean tables and builds convenient testing perks for the developer. No other records exist when the test starts, one can have certainty which data is being queried and even might be tempted to count rows during assertions. This comes with severe downsides: When running in a multi-process mode, tests are likely to interfere with each other. While process-1 purges tables, at the very moment process-2 queries for data and fail (because the DB was suddenly deleted by process-1). On top of this, It's harder to troubleshoot failing tests - Visiting the DB will show no records.\n\nThe second option is to clean up after all the test files have finished (or even daily!). This approach means that the same DB with existing records serves all the tests and processes. To avoid stepping on each other's toes, the tests must add and act on specific records that they have added. Need to check that some record was added? Assume that there are other thousands of records and query for records that were added explicitly. Need to check that a record was deleted? Can't assume an empty table, check that this specific record is not there. This technique brings few powerful gains: It works natively in multi-process mode, when a developer wishes to understand what happened - the data is there and not deleted. It also increases the chance of finding bugs because the DB is full of records and not artificially empty. [See the full comparison table here](https://github.com/testjavascript/nodejs-integration-tests-best-practices/blob/master/graphics/db-clean-options.png).\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Without a strategy to separate records or clean - Tests will step on each other toes; Using transactions will work only for relational DB and likely to get complicated once there are inner transactions\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Cleaning after ALL the tests. Not neccesserily after every run. The more data we have while the tests are running - The more it resembles the production perks\n\n```javascript\n  // After-all clean up (recommended)\n// global-teardown.js\nmodule.exports = async () => {\n  // ...\n  if (Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10) === 10) {\n    await new OrderRepository().cleanup();\n  }\n};\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f2.9 Isolate the component from the world using HTTP interceptor\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Isolate the component under test by intercepting any outgoing HTTP request and providing the desired response so the collaborator HTTP API won't get hit. Nock is a great tool for this mission as it provides a convenient syntax for defining external services behavior. Isolation is a must to prevent noise and slow performance but mostly to simulate various scenarios and responses - A good flight simulator is not about painting clear blue sky rather bringing safe storms and chaos. This is reinforced in a Microservice architecture where the focus should always be on a single component without involving the rest of the world. Though it's possible to simulate external service behavior using test doubles (mocking), it's preferable not to touch the deployed code and act on the network level to keep the tests pure black-box. The downside of isolation is not detecting when the collaborator component changes and not realizing misunderstandings between the two services - Make sure to compensate for this using a few contract or E2E tests\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Some services provide a fake version that can be deployed by the caller locally, usually using Docker - This will ease the setup and boost the performance but won't help with simulating various responses; Some services provide 'sandbox' environment, so the real service is hit but no costs or side effects are triggered - This will cut down the noise of setting up the 3rd party service but also won't allow simulating scenarios\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Preventing network calls to externous components allows simulating scenarios and minimizing the noise\n\n```javascript\n// Intercept requests for 3rd party APIs and return a predefined response \nbeforeEach(() => {\n  nock('http://localhost/user/').get(`/1`).reply(200, {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'John',\n  });\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f2.10 Test the response schema, mostly when there are auto-generated fields\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** When it is impossible to assert for specific data, check for mandatory field existence and types. Sometimes, the response contains important fields with dynamic data that can't be predicted when writing the test, like dates and incrementing numbers. If the API contract promises that these fields won't be null and hold the right types, it's imperative to test it. Most assertion libraries support checking types. If the response is small, check the return data and type together within the same assertion (see code example). One more option is to verify the entire response against an OpenAPI doc (Swagger). Most test runners have community extensions that validate API responses against their documentation.\n\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Although the code/API caller relies on some field with dynamic data (e.g., ID, date), it will not come in return and break the contract\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Asserting that fields with dynamic value exist and have the right type\n\n```javascript\n  test('When adding a new valid order, Then should get back approval with 200 response', async () => {\n  // ...\n  //Assert\n  expect(receivedAPIResponse).toMatchObject({\n    status: 200,\n    data: {\n      id: expect.any(Number), // Any number satisfies this test\n      mode: 'approved',\n    },\n  });\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f2.11 Check integrations corner cases and chaos\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** When checking integrations, go beyond the happy and sad paths. Check not only error responses (e.g. HTTP 500 error) but also network-level anomalies like slow and timed-out responses. This will prove that the code is resilient and can handle various network scenarios like taking the right path after a timeout, has no fragile race conditions, and contains a circuit breaker for retries. Reputable interceptor tools can easily simulate various network behaviors like hectic service that occasionally fail. It can even realize when the default HTTP client timeout value is longer than the simulated response time and throw a timeout exception right away without waiting\n\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** All your tests pass, it's only the production who will crash or won't report errors correctly when 3rd parties send exceptional responses\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Ensuring that on network failures, the circuit breaker can save the day\n\n```javascript\n  test('When users service replies with 503 once and retry mechanism is applied, then an order is added successfully', async () => {\n  //Arrange\n  nock.removeInterceptor(userServiceNock.interceptors[0])\n  nock('http://localhost/user/')\n    .get('/1')\n    .reply(503, undefined, { 'Retry-After': 100 });\n  nock('http://localhost/user/')\n    .get('/1')\n    .reply(200);\n  const orderToAdd = {\n    userId: 1,\n    productId: 2,\n    mode: 'approved',\n  };\n\n  //Act\n  const response = await axiosAPIClient.post('/order', orderToAdd);\n\n  //Assert\n  expect(response.status).toBe(200);\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f2.12 Test the five potential outcomes\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** When planning your tests, consider covering the five typical flow's outputs. When your test is triggering some action (e.g., API call), a reaction is happening, something meaningful occurs and calls for testing. Note that we don't care about how things work. Our focus is on outcomes, things that are noticeable from the outside and might affect the user. These outcomes/reactions can be put in 5 categories:\n\n\u2022 Response - The test invokes an action (e.g., via API) and gets a response. It's now concerned with checking the response data correctness, schema, and HTTP status\n\n\u2022 A new state - After invoking an action, some **publicly accessible** data is probably modified\n\n\u2022 External calls - After invoking an action, the app might call an external component via HTTP or any other transport. For example, a call to send SMS, email or charge a credit card\n\n\u2022 Message queues - The outcome of a flow might be a message in a queue\n\n\u2022 Observability - Some things must be monitored, like errors or remarkable business events. When a transaction fails, not only we expect the right response but also correct error handling and proper logging/metrics. This information goes directly to a very important user - The ops user (i.e., production SRE/admin)\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Section 3\ufe0f\u20e3: Frontend Testing\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 3.1 Separate UI from functionality\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** When focusing on testing component logic, UI details become a noise that should be extracted, so your tests can focus on pure data. Practically, extract the desired data from the markup in an abstract way that is not too coupled to the graphic implementation, assert only on pure data (vs HTML/CSS graphic details) and disable animations that slow down. You might get tempted to avoid rendering and test only the back part of the UI (e.g. services, actions, store) but this will result in fictional tests that don't resemble the reality and won't reveal cases where the right data doesn't even arrive in the UI\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** The pure calculated data of your test might be ready in 10ms, but then the whole test will last 500ms (100 tests = 1 min) due to some fancy and irrelevant animation\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Separating out the UI details\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20React-blue.svg \"Examples with React\") ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20React%20Testing%20Library-blue.svg \"Examples with react-testing-library\")\n\n```javascript\ntest(\"When users-list is flagged to show only VIP, should display only VIP members\", () => {\n  // Arrange\n  const allUsers = [{ id: 1, name: \"Yoni Goldberg\", vip: false }, { id: 2, name: \"John Doe\", vip: true }];\n\n  // Act\n  const { getAllByTestId } = render(<UsersList users={allUsers} showOnlyVIP={true} />);\n\n  // Assert - Extract the data from the UI first\n  const allRenderedUsers = getAllByTestId(\"user\").map(uiElement => uiElement.textContent);\n  const allRealVIPUsers = allUsers.filter(user => user.vip).map(user => user.name);\n  expect(allRenderedUsers).toEqual(allRealVIPUsers); //compare data with data, no UI here\n});\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: Assertion mix UI details and data\n\n```javascript\ntest(\"When flagging to show only VIP, should display only VIP members\", () => {\n  // Arrange\n  const allUsers = [{ id: 1, name: \"Yoni Goldberg\", vip: false }, { id: 2, name: \"John Doe\", vip: true }];\n\n  // Act\n  const { getAllByTestId } = render(<UsersList users={allUsers} showOnlyVIP={true} />);\n\n  // Assert - Mix UI & data in assertion\n  expect(getAllByTestId(\"user\")).toEqual('[<li data-test-id=\"user\">John Doe</li>]');\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 3.2 Query HTML elements based on attributes that are unlikely to change\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Query HTML elements based on attributes that are likely to survive graphic changes unlike CSS selectors and like form labels. If the designated element doesn't have such attributes, create a dedicated test attribute like 'test-id-submit-button'.

Avoid all sort of mocking, partial and shallow rendering - this approach might result in untrapped bugs due to lack of details and harden the maintenance as the tests mess with the internals (see bullet ['Favour blackbox testing'](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices#-%EF%B8%8F-14-stick-to-black-box-testing-test-only-public-methods)). If one of the child components is significantly slowing down (e.g. animation) or complicating the setup - consider explicitly replacing it with a fake\n\nWith all that said, a word of caution is in order: this technique works for small/medium components that pack a reasonable size of child components. Fully rendering a component with too many children will make it hard to reason about test failures (root cause analysis) and might get too slow. In such cases, write only a few tests against that fat parent component and more tests against its children\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** When poking into a component's internal by invoking its private methods, and checking the inner state - you would have to refactor all tests when refactoring the components implementation.

Also try to speed things up\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** In many cases, the unit under test completion time is just unknown (e.g. animation suspends element appearance) - in that case, avoid sleeping (e.g. setTimeOut) and prefer more deterministic methods that most platforms provide. Some libraries allows awaiting on operations (e.g. [Cypress cy.request('url')](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Unnecessary-Waiting)), other provide API for waiting like [@testing-library/dom method wait(expect(element))](https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-disappearance). Sometimes a more elegant way is to stub the slow resource, like API for example, and then once the response moment becomes deterministic the component can be explicitly re-rendered. When depending upon some external component that sleeps, it might turn useful to [hurry-up the clock](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/timer-mocks). Sleeping is a pattern to avoid because it forces your test to be slow or risky (when waiting for a too short period). Whenever sleeping and polling is inevitable and there's no support from the testing framework, some npm libraries like [wait-for-expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-for-expect) can help with a semi-deterministic solution\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** When sleeping for a long time, tests will be an order of magnitude slower. When trying to sleep for small numbers, test will fail when the unit under test didn't respond in a timely fashion.

The inspection tools market is no short: basic tools like [pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/), AWS CloudWatch, [gcp StackDriver](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks/) can be easily configured to watch whether the server is alive and response under a reasonable SLA. This only scratches the surface of what might get wrong, hence it's preferable to opt for tools that specialize in frontend (e.g. [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), [pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)) and perform richer analysis. The focus should be on symptoms, metrics that directly affect the UX, like page load time, [meaningful paint](https://scotch.io/courses/10-web-performance-audit-tips-for-your-next-billion-users-in-2018/fmp-first-meaningful-paint), [time until the page gets interactive (TTI)](https://calibreapp.com/blog/time-to-interactive/). On top of that, one may also watch for technical causes like ensuring the content is compressed, time to the first byte, optimize images, ensuring reasonable DOM size, SSL and many others. It's advisable to have these rich monitors both during development, as part of the CI and most important - 24x7 over the production's servers/CDN\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** It must be disappointing to realize that after such great care for crafting a UI, 100% functional tests passing and sophisticated bundling - the UX is horrible and slow due to CDN misconfiguration\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Lighthouse page load inspection report\n\n![](/assets/lighthouse2.png \"Lighthouse page load inspection report\")\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 3.6 Stub flaky and slow resources like backend APIs\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** When coding your mainstream tests (not E2E tests), avoid involving any resource that is beyond your responsibility and control like backend API and use stubs instead (i.e. test double). Practically, instead of real network calls to APIs, use some test double library (like [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/), [Test doubles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble), etc) for stubbing the API response. The main benefit is preventing flakiness - testing or staging APIs by definition are not highly stable and from time to time will fail your tests although YOUR component behaves just fine (production env was not meant for testing and it usually throttles requests). Doing this will allow simulating various API behavior that should drive your component behavior as when no data was found or the case when API throws an error. Last but not least, network calls will greatly slow down the tests\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** The average test runs no longer than few ms, a typical API call last 100ms>, this makes each test ~20x slower\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Stubbing or intercepting API calls\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20React-blue.svg \"Examples with React\") ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd27%20Example%20using%20React%20Testing%20Library-blue.svg \"Examples with react-testing-library\")\n\n```javascript\n// unit under test\nexport default function ProductsList() {\n  const [products, setProducts] = useState(false);\n\n  const fetchProducts = async () => {\n    const products = await axios.get(\"api/products\");\n    setProducts(products);\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchProducts();\n  }, []);\n\n  return products ? <div>{products}</div> : <div data-test-id=\"no-products-message\">No products</div>;\n}\n\n// test\ntest(\"When no products exist, show the appropriate message\", () => {\n  // Arrange\n  nock(\"api\")\n    .get(`/products`)\n    .reply(404);\n\n  // Act\n  const { getByTestId } = render(<ProductsList />);\n\n  // Assert\n  expect(getByTestId(\"no-products-message\")).toBeTruthy();\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 3.7 Have very few end-to-end tests that spans the whole system\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Although E2E (end-to-end) usually means UI-only testing with a real browser (See [bullet 3.6](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices#-%EF%B8%8F-36-stub-flaky-and-slow-resources-like-backend-apis)), for other they mean tests that stretch the entire system including the real backend. The latter type of tests is highly valuable as they cover integration bugs between frontend and backend that might happen due to a wrong understanding of the exchange schema. They are also an efficient method to discover backend-to-backend integration issues (e.g. Microservice A sends the wrong message to Microservice B) and even to detect deployment failures - there are no backend frameworks for E2E testing that are as friendly and mature as UI frameworks like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). The downside of such tests is the high cost of configuring an environment with so many components, and mostly their brittleness - given 50 microservices, even if one fails then the entire E2E just failed. For that reason, we should use this technique sparingly and probably have 1-10 of those and no more. That said, even a small number of E2E tests are likely to catch the type of issues they are targeted for - deployment & integration faults. It's advisable to run those over a production-like staging environment\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** UI might invest much in testing its functionality only to realizes very late that the backend returned payload (the data schema the UI has to work with) is very different than expected\n\n<br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 3.8 Speed-up E2E tests by reusing login credentials\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** In E2E tests that involve a real backend and rely on a valid user token for API calls, it doesn't payoff to isolate the test to a level where a user is created and logged-in in every request. Instead, login only once before the tests execution start (i.e. before-all hook), save the token in some local storage and reuse it across requests. This seem to violate one of the core testing principle - keep the test autonomous without resources coupling. While this is a valid worry, in E2E tests performance is a key concern and creating 1-3 API requests before starting each individual tests might lead to horrible execution time. Reusing credentials doesn't mean the tests have to act on the same user records - if relying on user records (e.g. test user payments history) than make sure to generate those records as part of the test and avoid sharing their existence with other tests. Also remember that the backend can be faked - if your tests are focused on the frontend it might be better to isolate it and stub the backend API (see [bullet 3.6](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices#-%EF%B8%8F-36-stub-flaky-and-slow-resources-like-backend-apis)).\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Given 200 test cases and assuming login=100ms = 20 seconds only for logging-in again and again\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Logging-in before-all and not before-each\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd28%20Example%20using%20Cypress-blue.svg \"Using Cypress to illustrate the idea\")\n\n```javascript\nlet authenticationToken;\n\n// happens before ALL tests run\nbefore(() => {\n  cy.request('POST', 'http://localhost:3000/login', {\n    username: Cypress.env('username'),\n    password: Cypress.env('password'),\n  })\n  .its('body')\n  .then((responseFromLogin) => {\n    authenticationToken = responseFromLogin.token;\n  })\n})\n\n// happens before EACH test\nbeforeEach(setUser => {\n  cy.visit('/home', () => {\n    onBeforeLoad (win => {\n      win.localStorage.setItem('token', JSON.stringify(authenticationToken))\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 3.9 Have one E2E smoke test that just travels across the site map\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** For production monitoring and development-time sanity check, run a single E2E test that visits all/most of the site pages and ensures no one breaks. This type of test brings a great return on investment as it's very easy to write and maintain, but it can detect any kind of failure including functional, network and deployment issues. Other styles of smoke and sanity checking are not as reliable and exhaustive - some ops teams just ping the home page (production) or developers who run many integration tests which don't discover packaging and browser issues. Goes without saying that the smoke test doesn't replace functional tests rather just aim to serve as a quick smoke detector\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Everything might seem perfect, all tests pass, production health-check is also positive but the Payment component had some packaging issue and only the /Payment route is not rendering\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Smoke travelling across all pages\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd28%20Example%20using%20Cypress-blue.svg \"Using Cypress to illustrate the idea\")\n\n```javascript\nit(\"When doing smoke testing over all page, should load them all successfully\", () => {\n  // exemplified using Cypress but can be implemented easily\n  // using any E2E suite\n  cy.visit(\"https://mysite.com/home\");\n  cy.contains(\"Home\");\n  cy.visit(\"https://mysite.com/Login\");\n  cy.contains(\"Login\");\n  cy.visit(\"https://mysite.com/About\");\n  cy.contains(\"About\");\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 3.10 Expose the tests as a live collaborative document\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Besides increasing app reliability, tests bring another attractive opportunity to the table - serve as live app documentation. Since tests inherently speak at a less-technical and product/UX language, using the right tools they can serve as a communication artifact that greatly aligns all the peers - developers and their customers. For example, some frameworks allow expressing the flow and expectations (i.e. tests plan) using a human-readable language so any stakeholder, including product managers, can read, approve and collaborate on the tests which just became the live requirements document. This technique is also being referred to as 'acceptance test' as it allows the customer to define his acceptance criteria in plain language. This is [BDD (behavior-driven testing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) at its purest form. One of the popular frameworks that enable this is [Cucumber which has a JavaScript flavor](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), see example below. Another similar yet different opportunity, [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/), allows exposing UI components as a graphic catalog where one can walk through the various states of each component (e.g. render a grid w/o filters, render that grid with multiple rows or with none, etc), see how it looks like, and how to trigger that state - this can appeal also to product folks but mostly serves as live doc for developers who consume those components.\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** After investing top resources on testing, it's just a pity not to leverage this investment and win great value\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Describing tests in human-language using cucumber-js\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd28%20Example%20using%20Cucumber-blue.svg \"Examples using Cucumber\")\n\n```text\nThis is how one can describe tests using cucumber: plain language that allows anyone to understand and collaborate\n\nFeature: Twitter new tweet\n\n  I want to tweet something in Twitter\n\n  @focus\n  Scenario: Tweeting from the home page\n    Given I open Twitter home\n    Given I click on \"New tweet\" button\n    Given I type \"Hello followers!\" in the textbox\n    Given I click on \"Submit\" button\n    Then I see message \"Tweet saved\"\n```\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Visualizing our components, their various states and inputs using Storybook\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd28%20Example%20using%20StoryBook-blue.svg \"Using StoryBook\")\n\n![alt text](assets/story-book.jpg \"Storybook\")\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 3.11 Detect visual issues with automated tools\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Setup automated tools to capture UI screenshots when changes are presented and detect visual issues like content overlapping or breaking. This ensures that not only the right data is prepared but also the user can conveniently see it. This technique is not widely adopted, our testing mindset leans toward functional tests but it's the visuals what the user experience and with so many device types it's very easy to overlook some nasty UI bug. Some free tools can provide the basics - generate and save screenshots for the inspection of human eyes. While this approach might be sufficient for small apps, it's flawed as any other manual testing that demands human labor anytime something changes. On the other hand, it's quite challenging to detect UI issues automatically due to the lack of clear definition - this is where the field of 'Visual Regression' chime in and solve this puzzle by comparing old UI with the latest changes and detect differences. Some OSS/free tools can provide some of this functionality (e.g. [wraith](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith), [PhantomCSS](<[https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS](https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS)>) but might charge significant setup time. The commercial line of tools (e.g. [Applitools](https://applitools.com/), [Percy.io](https://percy.io/)) takes is a step further by smoothing the installation and packing advanced features like management UI, alerting, smart capturing by eliminating 'visual noise' (e.g. ads, animations) and even root cause analysis of the DOM/CSS changes that led to the issue\n\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** How good is a content page that display great content (100% tests passed), loads instantly but half of the content area is hidden?\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: A typical visual regression - right content that is served badly\n\n![alt text](assets/amazon-visual-regression.jpeg \"Amazon page breaks\")\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Configuring wraith to capture and compare UI snapshots\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\ud83d\udd28%20Example%20using%20Wraith-blue.svg \"Using Wraith\")\n\n```\n\u200b# Add as many domains as necessary.

Coverage is a measure of how many code lines (and branches, statements, etc) are being reached by the tests. So how much is enough? 10\u201330% is obviously too low to get any sense about the build correctness, on the other side 100% is very expensive and might shift your focus from the critical paths to the exotic corners of the code. The long answer is that it depends on many factors like the type of application\u200a\u2014\u200aif you\u2019re building the next generation of Airbus A380 than 100% is a must, for a cartoon pictures website 50% might be too much. Although most of the testing enthusiasts claim that the right coverage threshold is contextual, most of them also mention the number 80% as a thumb of a rule ([Fowler: \u201cin the upper 80s or 90s\u201d](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html)) that presumably should satisfy most of the applications.\n\nImplementation tips: You may want to configure your continuous integration (CI) to have a coverage threshold ([Jest link](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#collectcoverage-boolean)) and stop a build that doesn\u2019t stand to this standard (it\u2019s also possible to configure threshold per component, see code example below). On top of this, consider detecting build coverage decrease (when a newly committed code has less coverage)\u200a\u2014\u200athis will push developers raising or at least preserving the amount of tested code.

[Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) is a JavaScript library for mutation testing and the implementation is really neat:\n\n(1) it intentionally changes the code and \u201cplants bugs\u201d.

Gone are the days where linting was about cosmetics (no semi-colons!). Nowadays, Linters can catch severe issues like errors that are not thrown correctly and losing information. On top of your basic set of rules (like [ESLint standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-standard) or [Airbnb style](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)), consider including some specializing Linters like [eslint-plugin-chai-expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-chai-expect) that can discover tests without assertions, [eslint-plugin-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-promise?activeTab=readme) can discover promises with no resolve (your code will never continue), [eslint-plugin-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security?activeTab=readme) which can discover eager regex expressions that might get used for DOS attacks, and [eslint-plugin-you-dont-need-lodash-underscore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-you-dont-need-lodash-underscore) is capable of alarming when the code uses utility library methods that are part of the V8 core methods like Lodash.\\_map(\u2026)\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Consider a rainy day where your production keeps crashing but the logs don\u2019t display the error stack trace. What happened? Your code mistakenly threw a non-error object and the stack trace was lost, a good reason for banging your head against a brick wall. A 5 min linter setup could detect this TYPO and save your day\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: The wrong Error object is thrown mistakenly, no stack-trace will appear for this error. Luckily, ESLint catches the next production bug\n\n![alt text](assets/bp-21-yoni-goldberg-eslint.jpeg \"The wrong Error object is thrown mistakenly, no stack-trace will appear for this error. Luckily, ESLint catches the next production bug\")\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 5.2 Shorten the feedback loop with local developer-CI\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Using a CI with shiny quality inspections like testing, linting, vulnerabilities check, etc? Help developers run this pipeline also locally to solicit instant feedback and shorten the [feedback loop](https://www.gocd.org/2016/03/15/are-you-ready-for-continuous-delivery-part-2-feedback-loops/). Why? an efficient testing process constitutes many and iterative loops: (1) try-outs -> (2) feedback -> (3) refactor. The faster the feedback is, the more improvement iterations a developer can perform per-module and perfect the results. On the flip, when the feedback is late to come fewer improvement iterations could be packed into a single day, the team might already move forward to another topic/task/module and might not be up for refining that module.\n\nPractically, some CI vendors (Example: [CircleCI local CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/)) allow running the pipeline locally. Some commercial tools like [wallaby provide highly-valuable & testing insights](https://wallabyjs.com/) as a developer prototype (no affiliation). Alternatively, you may just add npm script to package.json that runs all the quality commands (e.g. test, lint, vulnerabilities)\u200a\u2014\u200ause tools like [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) for parallelization and non-zero exit code if one of the tools failed. Now the developer should just invoke one command\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g. \u2018npm run quality\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200ato get instant feedback. Consider also aborting a commit if the quality check failed using a githook ([husky can help](https://github.com/typicode/husky))\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** When the quality results arrive the day after the code, testing doesn\u2019t become a fluent part of development rather an after the fact formal artifact\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: npm scripts that perform code quality inspection, all are run in parallel on demand or when a developer is trying to push new code\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"inspect:sanity-testing\": \"mocha **/**--test.js --grep \\\"sanity\\\"\",\n    \"inspect:lint\": \"eslint .\",\n    \"inspect:vulnerabilities\": \"npm audit\",\n    \"inspect:license\": \"license-checker --failOn GPLv2\",\n    \"inspect:complexity\": \"plato .\",\n    \"inspect:all\": \"concurrently -c \\\"bgBlue.bold,bgMagenta.bold,yellow\\\" \\\"npm:inspect:quick-testing\\\" \\\"npm:inspect:lint\\\" \\\"npm:inspect:vulnerabilities\\\" \\\"npm:inspect:license\\\"\"\n  },\n  \"husky\": {\n    \"hooks\": {\n      \"precommit\": \"npm run inspect:all\",\n      \"prepush\": \"npm run inspect:all\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f5.3 Perform e2e testing over a true production-mirror\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** End to end (e2e) testing are the main challenge of every CI pipeline\u200a\u2014\u200acreating an identical ephemeral production mirror on the fly with all the related cloud services can be tedious and expensive. Finding the best compromise is your game: [Docker-compose](https://serverless.com/) allows crafting isolated dockerized environment with identical containers using a single plain text file but the backing technology (e.g. networking, deployment model) is different from real-world productions. You may combine it with [\u2018AWS Local\u2019](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) to work with a stub of the real AWS services. If you went [serverless](https://serverless.com/) multiple frameworks like serverless and [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/serverless_app.html) allows the local invocation of FaaS code.\n\nThe huge Kubernetes ecosystem is yet to formalize a standard convenient tool for local and CI-mirroring though many new tools are launched frequently. One approach is running a \u2018minimized-Kubernetes\u2019 using tools like [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) and [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) which resemble the real thing only come with less overhead. Another approach is testing over a remote \u2018real-Kubernetes\u2019, some CI providers (e.g. [Codefresh](https://codefresh.io/)) has native integration with Kubernetes environment and make it easy to run the CI pipeline over the real thing, others allow custom scripting against a remote Kubernetes.\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Using different technologies for production and testing demands maintaining two deployment models and keeps the developers and the ops team separated\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Example: a CI pipeline that generates Kubernetes cluster on the fly <a href=\"https://container-solutions.com/dynamic-environments-kubernetes/\" data-href=\"https://container-solutions.com/dynamic-environments-kubernetes/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">([Credit: Dynamic-environments Kubernetes](https://container-solutions.com/dynamic-environments-kubernetes/))</a>\n\n<pre name=\"38d9\" id=\"38d9\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">deploy:<br>stage: deploy<br>image: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/kubernetes-deploy<br>script:<br>- ./configureCluster.sh $KUBE_CA_PEM_FILE $KUBE_URL $KUBE_TOKEN<br>- kubectl create ns $NAMESPACE<br>- kubectl create secret -n $NAMESPACE docker-registry gitlab-registry --docker-server=\"$CI_REGISTRY\" --docker-username=\"$CI_REGISTRY_USER\" --docker-password=\"$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD\" --docker-email=\"$GITLAB_USER_EMAIL\"<br>- mkdir .generated<br>- echo \"$CI_BUILD_REF_NAME-$CI_BUILD_REF\"<br>- sed -e \"s/TAG/$CI_BUILD_REF_NAME-$CI_BUILD_REF/g\" templates/deals.yaml | tee \".generated/deals.yaml\"<br>- kubectl apply --namespace $NAMESPACE -f .generated/deals.yaml<br>- kubectl apply --namespace $NAMESPACE -f templates/my-sock-shop.yaml<br>environment:<br>name: test-for-ci</pre>\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f5.4 Parallelize test execution\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** When done right, testing is your 24/7 friend providing almost instant feedback. In practice, executing 500 CPU-bounded unit test on a single thread can take too long. Luckily, modern test runners and CI platforms (like [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) and [Mocha extensions](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests)) can parallelize the test into multiple processes and achieve significant improvement in feedback time. Some CI vendors do also parallelize tests across containers (!) which shortens the feedback loop even further. Whether locally over multiple processes, or over some cloud CLI using multiple machines\u200a\u2014\u200aparallelizing demand keeping the tests autonomous as each might run on different processes\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Getting test results 1 hour long after pushing new code, as you already code the next features, is a great recipe for making testing less relevant\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Mocha parallel & Jest easily outrun the traditional Mocha thanks to testing parallelization ([Credit: JavaScript Test-Runners Benchmark](https://medium.com/dailyjs/javascript-test-runners-benchmark-3a78d4117b4))\n\n![alt text](assets/bp-24-yonigoldberg-jest-parallel.png \"Mocha parallel & Jest easily outrun the traditional Mocha thanks to testing parallelization (Credit: JavaScript Test-Runners Benchmark)\")\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f5.5 Stay away from legal issues using license and plagiarism check\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Licensing and plagiarism issues are probably not your main concern right now, but why not tick this box as well in 10 minutes? A bunch of npm packages like [license check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-checker) and [plagiarism check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plagiarism-checker) (commercial with free plan) can be easily baked into your CI pipeline and inspect for sorrows like dependencies with restrictive licenses or code that was copy-pasted from Stack Overflow and apparently violates some copyrights\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Unintentionally, developers might use packages with inappropriate licenses or copy paste commercial code and run into legal issues\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example:\n\n```shell\n# install license-checker in your CI environment or also locally\nnpm install -g license-checker\n\n# ask it to scan all licenses and fail with exit code other than 0 if it found unauthorized license. The CI system should catch this failure and stop the build\nlicense-checker --summary --failOn BSD\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n![alt text](assets/bp-25-nodejs-licsense.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f5.6 Constantly inspect for vulnerable dependencies\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities. This can get easily tamed using community tools such as [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/running-a-security-audit), or commercial tools like [snyk](https://snyk.io/) (offer also a free community version). Both can be invoked from your CI on every build\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Example: NPM Audit result\n\n![alt text](assets/bp-26-npm-audit-snyk.png \"NPM Audit result\")\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f5.7 Automate dependency updates\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Yarn and npm latest introduction of package-lock.json introduced a serious challenge (the road to hell is paved with good intentions)\u200a\u2014\u200aby default now, packages are no longer getting updates. Even a team running many fresh deployments with \u2018npm install\u2019 & \u2018npm update\u2019 won\u2019t get any new updates. This leads to subpar dependent packages versions at best or to vulnerable code at worst. Teams now rely on developers goodwill and memory to manually update the package.json or use tools [like ncu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) manually. A more reliable way could be to automate the process of getting the most reliable dependency versions, though there are no silver bullet solutions yet there are two possible automation roads:\n\n(1) CI can fail builds that have obsolete dependencies\u200a\u2014\u200ausing tools like [\u2018npm outdated\u2019](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated) or \u2018npm-check-updates (ncu)\u2019 . Doing so will enforce developers to update dependencies.\n\n(2) Use commercial tools that scan the code and automatically send pull requests with updated dependencies. One interesting question remaining is what should be the dependency update policy\u200a\u2014\u200aupdating on every patch generates too many overhead, updating right when a major is released might point to an unstable version (many packages found vulnerable on the very first days after being released, [see the](https://nodesource.com/blog/a-high-level-post-mortem-of-the-eslint-scope-security-incident/) eslint-scope incident).\n\nAn efficient update policy may allow some \u2018vesting period\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200alet the code lag behind the @latest for some time and versions before considering the local copy as obsolete (e.g. local version is 1.3.1 and repository version is 1.3.8)\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** Your production will run packages that have been explicitly tagged by their author as risky\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Example: [ncu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) can be used manually or within a CI pipeline to detect to which extent the code lag behind the latest versions\n\n![alt text](assets/bp-27-yoni-goldberg-npm.png \"ncu can be used manually or within a CI pipeline to detect to which extent the code lag behind the latest versions\")\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 5.8 Other, non-Node related, CI tips\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** This post is focused on testing advice that is related to, or at least can be exemplified with Node JS. This bullet, however, groups few non-Node related tips that are well-known\n\n <ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"e3e4\" id=\"e3e4\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Use a declarative syntax. This is the only option for most vendors but older versions of Jenkins allows using code or UI</li><li name=\"1fdc\" id=\"1fdc\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Opt for a vendor that has native Docker support</li><li name=\"edcd\" id=\"edcd\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Fail early, run your fastest tests first. Create a \u2018Smoke testing\u2019 step/milestone that groups multiple fast inspections (e.g. linting, unit tests) and provide snappy feedback to the code committer</li><li name=\"0375\" id=\"0375\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Make it easy to skim-through all build artifacts including test reports, coverage reports, mutation reports, logs, etc</li><li name=\"df82\" id=\"df82\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Create multiple pipelines/jobs for each event, reuse steps between them. For example, configure a job for feature branch commits and a different one for master PR. Let each reuse logic using shared steps (most vendors provide some mechanism for code reuse)</li><li name=\"19b0\" id=\"19b0\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Never embed secrets in a job declaration, grab them from a secret store or from the job\u2019s configuration</li><li name=\"b70d\" id=\"b70d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Explicitly bump version in a release build or at least ensure the developer did so</li><li name=\"957c\" id=\"957c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Build only once and perform all the inspections over the single build artifact (e.g. Docker image)</li><li name=\"339b\" id=\"339b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Test in an ephemeral environment that doesn\u2019t drift state between builds. Caching node_modules might be the only exception</li></ol>\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** You\u2018ll miss years of wisdom\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \u26aa \ufe0f 5.9 Build matrix: Run the same CI steps using multiple Node versions\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Quality checking is about serendipity, the more ground you cover the luckier you get in detecting issues early. When developing reusable packages or running a multi-customer production with various configuration and Node versions, the CI must run the pipeline of tests over all the permutations of configurations. For example, assuming we use MySQL for some customers and Postgres for others\u200a\u2014\u200asome CI vendors support a feature called \u2018Matrix\u2019 which allow running the suit of testing against all permutations of MySQL, Postgres and multiple Node version like 8, 9 and 10. This is done using configuration only without any additional effort (assuming you have testing or any other quality checks). Other CIs who doesn\u2019t support Matrix might have extensions or tweaks to allow that\n<br/>\n\n\u274c **Otherwise:** So after doing all that hard work of writing testing are we going to let bugs sneak in only because of configuration issues?\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\u270f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Example: Using Travis (CI vendor) build definition to run the same test over multiple Node versions\n\n<pre name=\"f909\" id=\"f909\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">language: node_js<br>node_js:<br>  - \"7\"<br>  - \"6\"<br>  - \"5\"<br>  - \"4\"<br>install:<br>  - npm install<br>script:<br>  - npm run test</pre>\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Team\n\n## Yoni Goldberg\n\n<br/>\n<img width=\"480px\" src=\"assets/yoni-goldberg.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n\n**Role:** Writer\n\n**About:** I'm an independent consultant who works with Fortune 500 companies and garage startups on polishing their JS & Node.js applications.
