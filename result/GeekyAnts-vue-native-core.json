It is a wrapper around the APIs of React Native. So, with Vue Native, you can do everything that you can do with React Native. With Vue Native, you get\n\n- **The simplicity of Vue.js.** Incrementally build user interfaces with the familiar syntax of HTML and CSS in single file components.\n- **Seamless interop with React Native.** Use core React Native components with Vue.js syntax out of the box to develop mobile apps on both iOS and Android.\n\n## Contents\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Project setup with Vue Native CLI](#project-setup-with-vue-native-cli)\n- [Using Vue Native with a pre-existing React Native or Expo project](#using-vue-native-in-a-react-native-project)\n- [Available React Native components](#available-react-native-components)\n- [Contributors](#contributors)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Special thanks](#credits-to-react-vue)\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the full documentation for Vue Native [on this website](https://vue-native.io/docs/installation.html). It covers installation and setup, component basics, routing, testing, the internal API and more.\n\nThe source for the Vue Native documentation and website is hosted on a separate repo, [here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-website)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install Vue Native's official CLI, run\n```\n$ npm install vue-native-cli -g\n```\n\nTo use the CLI, you must have either [expo-cli](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli) or [react-native-cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) installed globally.\n\n## Project setup with Vue Native CLI\n\nThe Vue Native CLI can be used to easily generate a fully configured Vue Native app. It wraps `expo-cli` and `react-native-cli` to generate a simple single page application (SPA) after installing and configuring dependencies from [vue-native-core](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core).\n\nYou should have either expo-cli or react-native-cli installed as a global dependency. Refer to the [installation guide](https://vue-native.io/docs/installation.html) for details on project setup. The GitHub repository for Vue Native CLI is hosted [here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-cli).\n\nWith the CLI, generating a Vue Native project is as easy as running the command\n```\n$ vue-native init <projectName>\n```\n\n## Using Vue Native in a React Native project\n\nIt is possible to integrate Vue Native into a pre-existing React Native project. You can find instructions to do this [here](converting-react-native-project.md).\n\nThese instructions can also be used to set up a Vue Native project from scratch.\n\n## Available React Native components\n\nAll the core components of React Native 0.63 onwards are globally registered and available to use in templates without the need to import and locally register.\n\n[The components and their React Native documentation can be found here.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis)\n\nAll other components that were previously available, but then deprecated from React Native can still be used by installing their respective packages.\n\nFor example, to use `WebView`, use the [react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview) package.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute. \n<a href=\"https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core/contributors\"><img src=\"https://opencollective.com/vue-native-core/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false\" /></a>\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n## Credits to [react-vue](https://github.com/SmallComfort/react-vue)\n\nA huge thanks to the author of react-vue for most of the work on Vue Native.\n",
