This\nproject is an example of how the popular FizzBuzz game might be built were it\nsubject to the high quality standards of enterprise software.\n\n## FizzBuzz\n\nFizzBuzz is a game that has gained in popularity as a programming assignment to\nweed out non-programmers during job interviews. The object of the assignment is\nless about solving it correctly according to the below rules and more about\nshowing the programmer understands basic, necessary tools such as\n`if`-/`else`-statements and loops. The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:\n\nFor numbers 1 through 100,\n\n* if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;\n* if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;\n* if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;\n* else, print the number.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAlthough this project is intended as satire, we take openness and inclusivity\nvery seriously. To that end we have adopted the following code of conduct.\n\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n",
