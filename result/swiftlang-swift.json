Swift\n\nSwift is a high-performance system programming language.  It has a clean\nand modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code\nand frameworks, and is memory-safe by default.\n\nAlthough inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a\nC-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core\nfeatures like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level\nconstructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces\nmodules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.\n\nTo learn more about the programming language, visit [swift.org](https://swift.org/documentation/).\n\n- [Contributing to Swift](#contributing-to-swift)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  - [Swift Toolchains](#swift-toolchains)\n  - [Build Failures](#build-failures)\n- [Learning More](#learning-more)\n\n## Contributing to Swift\n\nContributions to Swift are welcomed and encouraged! Please see the\n[Contributing to Swift guide](https://swift.org/contributing/).\n\nBefore submitting the pull request, please make sure you have [tested your\n changes](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/ContinuousIntegration.md)\n and that they follow the Swift project [guidelines for contributing\n code](https://swift.org/contributing/#contributing-code).\n\nTo be a truly great community, [Swift.org](https://swift.org/) needs to welcome\ndevelopers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide\nrange of experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great\nideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code. We will work\ndiligently to make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.\n\nTo give clarity of what is expected of our members, Swift has adopted the\ncode of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant. This document is used\nacross many open source communities, and we think it articulates our values\nwell. For more, see the [Code of Conduct](https://swift.org/code-of-conduct/).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you are interested in:\n- Contributing fixes and features to the compiler: See our\n  [How to Submit Your First Pull Request guide](/docs/HowToGuides/FirstPullRequest.md).\n- Building the compiler as a one-off: See our [Getting Started guide][].\n- Building a toolchain as a one-off: Follow the [Getting Started guide][]\n  up until the \"Building the project\" section. After that, follow the\n  instructions in the [Swift Toolchains](#swift-toolchains) section below.\n\nWe also have an [FAQ](/docs/HowToGuides/FAQ.md) that answers common questions.\n\n[Getting Started guide]: /docs/HowToGuides/GettingStarted.md\n\n### Swift Toolchains\n\n#### Building\n\nSwift toolchains are created using the script\n[build-toolchain](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/utils/build-toolchain). This\nscript is used by swift.org's CI to produce snapshots and can allow for one to\nlocally reproduce such builds for development or distribution purposes. A typical \ninvocation looks like the following:\n\n```sh\n  $ ./swift/utils/build-toolchain $BUNDLE_PREFIX\n```\n\nwhere ``$BUNDLE_PREFIX`` is a string that will be prepended to the build \ndate to give the bundle identifier of the toolchain's ``Info.plist``. For \ninstance, if ``$BUNDLE_PREFIX`` was ``com.example``, the toolchain \nproduced will have the bundle identifier ``com.example.YYYYMMDD``. It \nwill be created in the directory you run the script with a filename \nof the form: ``swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx.tar.gz``.\n\nBeyond building the toolchain, ``build-toolchain`` also supports the \nfollowing (non-exhaustive) set of useful options:\n\n- ``--dry-run``: Perform a dry run build. This is off by default.\n- ``--test``: Test the toolchain after it has been compiled. This is off by default.\n- ``--distcc``: Use distcc to speed up the build by distributing the C++ part of\n  the swift build. This is off by default.\n- ``--sccache``: Use sccache to speed up subsequent builds of the compiler by\n  caching more C++ build artifacts. This is off by default.\n\nMore options may be added over time. Please pass ``--help`` to\n``build-toolchain`` to see the full set of options.\n\n#### Installing into Xcode\n\nOn macOS if one wants to install such a toolchain into Xcode:\n\n1. Untar and copy the toolchain to one of `/Library/Developer/Toolchains/` or\n   `~/Library/Developer/Toolchains/`. E.g.:\n\n```sh\n  $ sudo tar -xzf swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx.tar.gz -C /\n  $ tar -xzf swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx.tar.gz -C ~/\n```\n\nThe script also generates an archive containing debug symbols which\ncan be installed over the main archive allowing symbolication of any\ncompiler crashes.\n\n```sh\n  $ sudo tar -xzf swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx-symbols.tar.gz -C /\n  $ tar -xzf swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx-symbols.tar.gz -C ~/\n```\n\n2. Specify the local toolchain for Xcode's use via `Xcode->Toolchains`.\n\n### Build Failures\n\nTry the suggestions in\n[Troubleshooting build issues](/docs/HowToGuides/GettingStarted.md#troubleshooting-build-issues).\n\nMake sure you are using the\n[correct release](/docs/HowToGuides/GettingStarted.md#installing-dependencies)\nof Xcode.\n\nIf you have changed Xcode versions but still encounter errors that appear to\nbe related to the Xcode version, try passing `--clean` to `build-script`.\n\nWhen a new version of Xcode is released, you can update your build without\nrecompiling the entire project by passing `--reconfigure` to `build-script`.\n\n## Learning More\n\nBe sure to look at the [documentation index](/docs/README.md) for a bird's eye\nview of the available documentation. In particular, the documents titled\n[Debugging the Swift Compiler](docs/DebuggingTheCompiler.md) and\n[Continuous Integration for Swift](docs/ContinuousIntegration.md) are very\nhelpful to understand before submitting your first PR.\n",
