While nearly *all* of Lamport's work should feature here, just adding a few that *must* be read.\n- [Times, Clocks and Ordering of Events in Distributed Systems](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/time-clocks.pdf) Lamport's paper, the Quintessential distributed systems primer\n- [Session Guarantees for Weakly Consistent Replicated Data](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dahlin/Classes/GradOS/papers/SessionGuaranteesPDIS.pdf) a '94 paper that talks about various recommendations for session guarantees for eventually consistent systems, many of this would be standard vocabulary in reading other dist. sys papers, like monotonic reads, read your writes etc.\n\n### Storage & Databases\n- [Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key Value Store](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf)\nParaphrasing @fogus from their [blog](http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/08/10-technical-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice/), it is very rare for a paper describing an active production system to influence the state of active research in any industry; this is one of those seminal distributed systems paper that solves the problem of a highly available and fault tolerant database in an elegant way, later paving the way for systems like Cassandra, and many other AP systems using a consistent hashing.\n- [Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf)\n- [The Google File System](http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf)\n- [Cassandra: A Decentralized Structured Storage System](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.161.6751&rep=rep1&type=pdf) Inspired heavily by Dynamo, an now an open source\n- [CRUSH: Controlled, Scalable, Decentralized Placement of Replicated Data](http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/Papers/weil-sc06.pdf), the algorithm for the basis of Ceph distributed storage system, for the architecture itself read [RADOS](http://ceph.com/papers/weil-rados-pdsw07.pdf)\n\n### Messaging systems\n- [The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data's unifying abstraction](http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying), a somewhat long read, but covers brilliantly on logs, which are at the heart of most distributed systems\n- [Kafka: a Distributed Messaging System for Log Processing](http://notes.stephenholiday.com/Kafka.pdf)\n\n### Distributed Consensus and Fault-Tolerance\n- [Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf)\n- [The Byzantine Generals Problem](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/byz.pdf)\n- [Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process](http://macs.citadel.edu/rudolphg/csci604/ImpossibilityofConsensus.pdf)\n- [The Part Time Parliament](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf) Paxos, Lamport's original Paxos paper, a bit difficult to understand, may require multiple passes\n- [Paxos Made Simple](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf), a more terse readable Paxos paper by Lamport himself. Shorter and more easier compared to the original.\n- [The Chubby Lock Service for loosely coupled distributed systems](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/chubby-osdi06.pdf) Google's lock service used for loosely coupled distributed systems. Sort of Paxos as a Service for building other distributed systems. Primary inspiration behind other Service Discovery & Coordination tools like Zookeeper, etcd, Consul etc.\n- [Paxos made live - An engineering perspective](http://research.google.com/archive/paxos_made_live.html) Google's learning while implementing systems atop of Paxos. Demonstrates various practical issues encountered while implementing a theoretical concept.\n- [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raftconsensus.github.io/) An alternative to Paxos for distributed consensus, that is much simpler to understand. Do checkout an [interesting visualization of raft](http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/)\n- [Conflict-free Replicated Data Types](https://pages.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro/papers/RR-7687.pdf) presents an approach for Strong Eventual Consistency which as been applied in projects such as [Riak](http://basho.com/products/riak-kv/), [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [Akka](https://akka.io/). A great talk on the subject by Martin Kleppmann can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5NULPSiOGw)\n- Speculative algorithms for global state synchronizations [Azos.Sky.Server.Locking](https://github.com/azist/azos/tree/master/src/Azos.Sky.Server/Locking) uses probability based QOS (Quality of Service)/Trust measure to ensure probability-based consensus. The approach avoids distributed state machine/phase synchronization and is very simple to understand and implement\n\n### Testing, monitoring and tracing\nWhile designing distributed systems are hard enough, testing them is even harder.\n- [Dapper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36356.pdf), Google's large scale distributed-systems tracing infrastructure, this was also the basis for the design of open source projects such as [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/), [Apache SkyWalking](https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking), [Pinpoint](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint) and [HTrace](http://htrace.incubator.apache.org/).\n\n### Programming Models\n- [Distributed Programming Model](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~pandey/Research/Papers/icdcs01.pdf)\n- [PSync: a partially synchronous language for fault-tolerant distributed algorithms](http://www.di.ens.fr/~cezarad/popl16.pdf) Video: [Conference Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxfq9_L9T1U&t=51s)\n- [Programming Models for Distributed Computing](http://heather.miller.am/teaching/cs7680/)\n- [Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/UCB-lattice-tr.pdf)\n\n### Verification of Distributed Systems\n- Curated list of resources on [testing distributed systems](https://asatarin.github.io/testing-distributed-systems/) includes links to materials on testing by various companies (Google, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Dropbox, etc) and research papers.\n- [Jepsen](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen) A framework for distributed systems verification, with fault injection\n  @aphyr has featured enough times in this list already, but Jepsen and the blog posts that go with are a quintessntial addition to any distributed systems reading list.\n- [Verdi](http://verdi.uwplse.org/) A Framework for Implementing and Formally Verifying Distributed Systems [Paper](http://verdi.uwplse.org/verdi.pdf)\n\n## Videos\n- [Distributed Deep Dive](https://www.ably.io/blog/introducing-distributed-deep-dive-interview-series-by-ably-realtime/) interview series by [Ably Relatime](https://ably.io).\n- [Distributed Systems in One Lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6Ev8GIlbxc&t=17s) Distributed Systems in One Lesson by Tim Berglund\n\n## Courses\n- [Reliable Distributed Algorithms, Part 1](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:KTHx+ID2203.1x+3T_2017), KTH Sweden\n- [Reliable Distributed Algorithms, Part 2](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:KTHx+ID2203.2x+2016T4), KTH Sweden\n- [Cloud Computing Concepts](https://class.coursera.org/cloudcomputing-001), University of Illinois\n- [CMU: Distributed Systems](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-440/F12/syllabus.html) in Go Programming Language\n- [Software Defined Networking](https://www.coursera.org/course/sdn) , Georgia Tech.\n- [ETH Zurich: Distributed Systems](http://dcg.ethz.ch/lectures/podc_allstars/)\n- [ETH Zurich: Distributed Systems Part 2](http://dcg.ethz.ch/lectures/distsys), covers  Distributed control algorithms, communication models, fault-tolerance among other things.
