It is designed from the ground up to address the unique pain points C/C++\ndevelopers experience.\n\nThis tool and ecosystem are constantly evolving, and we always appreciate\ncontributions! Learn how to start contributing with our [packaging\ntutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-adding-to-registry) and [maintainer\nguide](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/contributing/maintainer-guide).\n\n# Get started\n\nFirst, follow one of our quick start guides.\n\nWhether you're using CMake, MSBuild, or any other build system, vcpkg has you covered:\n\n* [vcpkg with CMake](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/get_started/get-started)\n* [vcpkg with MSBuild](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-msbuild)\n* [vcpkg with other build systems](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/users/buildsystems/manual-integration)\n\nYou can also use any editor:\n\n* [vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-vs)\n* [vcpkg with Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-vscode)\n* [vcpkg with\n  CLion](<https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/package-management.html>)\n* [vcpkg with Qt Creator](<https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-vcpkg.html>)\n\nIf a library you need is not present in the vcpkg registry, [open an issue on\nthe GitHub repository][contributing:submit-issue] or [contribute the package\nyourself](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-adding-to-registry).\n\nAfter you've gotten vcpkg installed and working, you may wish to [add\ntab completion to your terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/commands/integrate#vcpkg-autocompletion).\n\n# Use vcpkg\n\nCreate a [manifest for your project's dependencies](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/consume/manifest-mode):\n\n```Console\nvcpkg new --application\nvcpkg add port fmt\n```\n\nOr [install packages through the command line](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/consume/classic-mode):\n\n```Console\nvcpkg install fmt\n```\n\nThen use one of our available integrations for\n[CMake](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/concepts/build-system-integration#cmake-integration),\n[MSBuild](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/concepts/build-system-integration#msbuild-integration) or \n[other build\nsystems](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/concepts/build-system-integration#manual-integration).\n\nFor a short description of all available commands, run `vcpkg help`.\nRun `vcpkg help [topic]` for details on a specific topic.\n\n# Key features\n\nvcpkg offers powerful features for your package management needs:\n\n* [easily integrate with your build system](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/concepts/build-system-integration)\n* [control the versions of your dependencies](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/users/versioning)\n* [package and publish your own packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/concepts/registries)\n* [reuse your binary artifacts](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/users/binarycaching)\n* [enable offline scenarios with asset caching](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/concepts/asset-caching)\n\n# Contribute\n\nvcpkg is an open source project, and is thus built with your contributions. Here\nare some ways you can contribute:\n\n* [Submit issues][contributing:submit-issue] in vcpkg or existing packages\n* [Submit fixes and new packages][contributing:submit-pr]\n\nPlease refer to our [mantainer guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/contributing/maintainer-guide) and\n[packaging tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-packaging) for more details.\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of\nConduct][contributing:coc].

For use\nbehind a firewall, the specific access needed will depend on which ports are\nbeing installed.

The data\ncollected by Microsoft is anonymous. You can opt-out of telemetry by:\n\n- running the bootstrap-vcpkg script with `-disableMetrics`\n- passing `--disable-metrics` to vcpkg on the command line\n- setting the `VCPKG_DISABLE_METRICS` environment variable\n\nRead more about vcpkg telemetry at [https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/about/privacy](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/about/privacy).\n",
