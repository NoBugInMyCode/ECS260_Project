You'll see something like this:\n\n```\nratchet/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 css/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ratchet.css\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ratchet.min.css\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ratchet-theme-android.css\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ratchet-theme-android.min.css\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ratchet-theme-ios.css\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ratchet-theme-ios.min.css\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 js/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ratchet.js\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ratchet.min.js\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 fonts/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ratchicons.eot\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ratchicons.svg\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ratchicons.ttf\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ratchicons.woff\n```\n\nWe provide compiled CSS and JS (`ratchet.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`ratchet.min.*`). The Ratchicon fonts are included, as are the optional Android and iOS platform themes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nRatchet's documentation is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://goratchet.com>. The docs may also be run locally.\n\n### Running documentation locally\n\n1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v3.0.x).\n  * **Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.\n2. Install the Ruby-based syntax highlighter, [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge), with `gem install rouge`.\n3. From the root `/ratchet` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.\n4. Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and boom!\n\nLearn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).\n\n### Documentation for previous releases\n\nDocumentation for v1.0.2 has been made available for the time being at <http://goratchet.com/1.0.2/> while folks transition to Ratchet 2.\n\n[Previous releases](https://github.com/twbs/ratchet/releases) and their documentation are also available for download.\n\n## Support\n\nQuestions or discussions about Ratchet should happen in the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/goratchet) or hit us up on Twitter [@GoRatchet](https://twitter.com/goratchet).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease file a GitHub issue to [report a bug](https://github.com/twbs/ratchet/issues). When reporting a bug, be sure to follow the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/ratchet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nA small list of \"gotchas\" is provided below for designers and developers starting to work with Ratchet.\n\n* Ratchet is designed to respond to touch events from a mobile device. In order to use mouse click events (for desktop browsing and testing), you have a few options:\n  * Enable touch event emulation in Chrome (found in the overrides tab in the web inspector preferences)\n  * Use a JavaScript library like fingerblast.js to emulate touch events (ideally only loaded from desktop devices)\n* Script tags containing JavaScript will not be executed on pages that are loaded with push.js. If you would like to attach event handlers to elements on other pages, document-level event delegation is a common solution.\n* Ratchet uses XHR requests to fetch additional pages inside the application. Due to security concerns, modern browsers prevent XHR requests when opening files locally (aka using the `file://` protocol); consequently, Ratchet does not work when opened directly as a file.\n  * A common solution to this is to simply serve the files from a local server. One convenient way to achieve this is to run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port>` to serve up the files in the current directory to `http://localhost:<port>`\n\n## Versioning\n\nFor transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Ratchet is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to these rules whenever possible.\n\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\n\n* Breaking backward compatibility **bumps the major** while resetting minor and patch\n* New additions without breaking backward compatibility **bumps the minor** while resetting the patch\n* Bug fixes and misc changes **bumps only the patch**\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit <http://semver.org/>.\n\n## Maintainers\n\nConnor Sears\n\n* <https://twitter.com/connors>\n* <https://github.com/connors>\n\n\nCreated by Connor Sears, Dave Gamache, and Jacob Thornton.\n\n\n## License\n\nRatchet is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n",
