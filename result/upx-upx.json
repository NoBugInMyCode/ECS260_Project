UPX will typically\nreduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%, thus\nreducing disk space, network load times, download times and\nother distribution and storage costs.\n\nPrograms and libraries compressed by UPX are completely self-contained\nand run exactly as before, with no runtime or memory penalty for most\nof the supported formats.\n\nUPX supports a number of different executable formats, including\nWindows programs and DLLs, and Linux executables.\n\nUPX is free software distributed under the term of the GNU General\nPublic License. Full source code is available.\n\nUPX may be distributed and used freely, even with commercial applications.\nSee the UPX License Agreements for details.\n\n\nSECURITY CONTEXT\n================\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: UPX inherits the security context of any files it handles.\n\nThis means that packing, unpacking, or even testing or listing a file requires\nthe same security considerations as actually executing the file.\n\nUse UPX on trusted files only!\n\n\nSHORT DOCUMENTATION\n===================\n\n'upx program.exe' will compress a program or DLL. For best compression\nresults try 'upx --best program.exe' or 'upx --brute program.exe'.\n\nPlease see the file UPX.DOC for the full documentation. The files\nNEWS and BUGS also contain various tidbits of information.\n\n\nTHE FUTURE\n==========\n\n  - Stay up-to-date with ongoing OS and executable format changes\n\n  - RISC-V 64 for Linux\n\n  - ARM64 for Windows (help wanted)\n\n  - We will *NOT* add any sort of protection and/or encryption.\n    This only gives people a false feeling of security because\n    all \"protectors\" can be broken by definition.\n\n  - Fix all remaining bugs - please report any issues\n    https://github.com/upx/upx/issues\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n=========\n\nCopyright (C) 1996-2025 Markus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumer\nCopyright (C) 1996-2025 Laszlo Molnar\nCopyright (C) 2000-2025 John F.
