If you're interested in contributing or using it at your company, feel free to open a GitHub issue or get in touch with me on Twitter [@dvnabbott](https://twitter.com/dvnabbott). I'm currently supporting a few early adopters.\n>\n> Airbnb doesn't provide support for this project. The code and automated tests are not at the same degree of technical rigor as other Airbnb projects.\n\n## Overview\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/airbnb/Lona.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/airbnb/Lona)\n\nLona is a collection of tools for building design systems and using them to generate cross-platform UI code, Sketch files, and other artifacts.\n\nLona consists primarily of 3 parts:\n\n- [Lona Components](#lona-components) - A data format, `.component`, for cross-platform components\n- [Lona Studio](#lona-studio) - A GUI tool for designing `.component` files\n- [Lona Compiler](#lona-compiler) - A CLI tool & API for generating UI code from `.component` files\n\nWhy Lona? Read more about challenges with cross-platform design systems at scale, and how Lona solves them [here](./docs/overview/background.md).\n\n### Lona Components\n\nA design system is defined in JSON as a collection of:\n\n- Components (can be nested)\n- Colors, Text Styles, Gradients, and Shadows\n- Data Types\n\nThe specification for these files can be found in the [docs](./docs/file-formats/README.md).\n\n### Lona Studio\n\nLona Studio provides a graphical interface for working with `.component` files.\n\nLona Studio is primarily for building component systems, but can also be used for:\n\n- Quickly mocking up new screens from existing components\n- Viewing designs with real data from JSON files or APIs\n- Experimenting with designs across multiple screen sizes\n- Automating design tasks - e.g. localizing screenshots for different languages and exporting hundreds of images\n- Working with animations (Lottie) and rendering videos from them\n- and more!\n\nIf you have Xcode installed, you can try it out by following the [installation instructions](./studio/README.md).\n\n> Wondering if this replaces Sketch? Why a native Mac App? I answer some common questions here in the [FAQ](./docs/overview/faq.md).\n\n### Lona Compiler\n\nThe Lona Compiler converts .component files to UI code for various targets.\n\nCurrently, these targets are supported:\n\n- iOS / macOS (Swift)\n- React DOM / React Native / React Sketchapp (JavaScript)\n\nSupport is planned for:\n\n- Android (Kotlin)\n\nThe target with the most features currently is Swift. However, it's still fairly rough. If you want to try it out, check out the [installation instructions](./compiler/core/README.md).\n\nIf you're looking for a sample of the generated code, check out [the test cases](./examples/generated/test)\n\n## Core Team\n\n- Created by [@dvnabbott](https://twitter.com/dvnabbott)\n- Design tool integrations and infrastructure by [@mathieudutour](https://twitter.com/mathieudutour)\n\n### Contributors\n\n- Lona Compiler development by [@outdooricon](https://github.com/outdooricon)\n- Design & development help by [@ryngonzalez](https://twitter.com/ryngonzalez)\n- Gorgeous logo by [@pablocar0](https://twitter.com/pablocar0)\n- Lona Studio development by [Nghia Tran](https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT)\n- Swift code generation help by [Laura Skelton](https://twitter.com/skelovenko)\n- Lona Compiler development by [Jason Zurita](https://twitter.com/jasonalexzurita)\n",
