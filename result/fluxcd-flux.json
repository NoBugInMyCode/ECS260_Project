With adoption came a wave of feature requests\nthat required a major overhaul of Flux monolithic code base and security stance.\n\nIn April 2020, the Flux team decided to redesign Flux from the ground up using modern\ntechnologies such as Kubernetes controller runtime and Custom Resource Definitions.\nThe decision was made to break Flux functionally into specialised components and APIs\nwith a focus on extensibility, observability and security.\nThese components are now called the [GitOps Toolkit](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/).\n\nIn 2021, the Flux team launched Flux v2 with many long-requested features like\nsupport for multi-tenancy, support for syncing an arbitrary number of Git repositories,\nbetter observability and a solid security stance. The new version made it possible\nto extend Flux capabilities beyond its original GitOps design. The community rallied\naround the new design, with an overwhelming number of early adopters and\nnew contributions, Flux v2 gained new features at a very rapid pace.\n\nIn 2022, Flux v2 underwent several security audits, and its code base and APIs became stable\nand production ready. Having a dedicated UI for Flux was the most requested feature since we\nstarted the project. For v2, Weaveworks launched a free and open source Web UI for Flux called\n[Weave GitOps](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops), which made Flux and the GitOps\npractices more accessible.\n\nToday Flux is an established continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes,\n[trusted by organisations](https://fluxcd.io/adopters/) around the world.\nVarious vendors like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, VMware, Weaveworks\nand others offer [Flux as-a-service](https://fluxcd.io/ecosystem/) to their users.\nThe Flux team is very grateful to the community who supported us over the\nyears and made Flux what it is today.\n",
