We use GitHub issues for tracking new requests and bugs.\nYour feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n**If you'd like to contribute, be sure to review the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).**\n\n## Development\n\nTo run the visualization locally, run:\n- `npm i` to install dependencies\n- `npm run build` to compile the app and place it in the `dist/` directory\n- `npm run serve` to serve from the `dist/` directory and open a page on your browser.\n\nFor a fast edit-refresh cycle when developing run `npm run serve-watch`.\nThis will start an http server and automatically re-compile the TypeScript,\nHTML and CSS files whenever they change.\n\n## For owners\nTo push to production: `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`.\n\nThis is not an official Google product.\n",
