Compatibility with Tesseract 3 is enabled by using the Legacy OCR Engine mode (--oem 0).\nIt also needs [traineddata](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files.html) files which support the legacy engine, for example those from the [tessdata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) repository.\n\nStefan Weil is the current lead developer. Ray Smith was the lead developer until 2018. The maintainer is Zdenko Podobny. For a list of contributors see [AUTHORS](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/AUTHORS)\nand GitHub's log of [contributors](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/graphs/contributors).\n\nTesseract has **unicode (UTF-8) support**, and can **recognize [more than 100 languages](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html)** \"out of the box\".\n\nTesseract supports **[various image formats](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/InputFormats)** including PNG, JPEG and TIFF.\n\nTesseract supports **various output formats**: plain text, hOCR (HTML), PDF, invisible-text-only PDF, TSV, ALTO and PAGE.\n\nYou should note that in many cases, in order to get better OCR results, you'll need to **[improve the quality](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ImproveQuality.html) of the image** you are giving Tesseract.\n\nThis project **does not include a GUI application**. If you need one, please see the [3rdParty](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/User-Projects-%E2%80%93-3rdParty.html) documentation.\n\nTesseract **can be trained to recognize other languages**.\nSee [Tesseract Training](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Training-Tesseract.html) for more information.\n\n## Brief history\n\nTesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol UK and at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado USA between 1985 and 1994, with some more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998. In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. From 2006 until November 2018 it was developed by Google.\n\nMajor version 5 is the current stable version and started with release\n[5.0.0](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/5.0.0) on November 30, 2021. Newer minor versions and bugfix versions are available from\n[GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/).\n\nLatest source code is available from [main branch on GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tree/main).\nOpen issues can be found in [issue tracker](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues),\nand [planning documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Planning.html).\n\nSee **[Release Notes](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ReleaseNotes.html)**\nand **[Change Log](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/ChangeLog)** for more details of the releases.\n\n## Installing Tesseract\n\nYou can either [Install Tesseract via pre-built binary package](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html)\nor [build it from source](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling.html).\n\nBefore building Tesseract from source, please check that your system has a compiler which is one of the [supported compilers](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/supported-compilers.html).\n\n## Running Tesseract\n\nBasic **[command line usage](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Command-Line-Usage.html)**:\n\n    tesseract imagename outputbase [-l lang] [--oem ocrenginemode] [--psm pagesegmode] [configfiles...]\n\nFor more information about the various command line options use `tesseract --help` or `man tesseract`.\n\nExamples can be found in the [documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Command-Line-Usage.html#simplest-invocation-to-ocr-an-image).\n\n## For developers\n\nDevelopers can use `libtesseract` [C](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/include/tesseract/capi.h) or\n[C++](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/include/tesseract/baseapi.h) API to build their own application. If you need bindings to `libtesseract` for other programming languages, please see the\n[wrapper](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/AddOns.html#tesseract-wrappers) section in the AddOns documentation.\n\nDocumentation of Tesseract generated from source code by doxygen can be found on [tesseract-ocr.github.io](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/).\n\n## Support\n\nBefore you submit an issue, please review **[the guidelines for this repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)**.\n\nFor support, first read the [documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/),\nparticularly the [FAQ](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/FAQ.html) to see if your problem is addressed there.\nIf not, search the [Tesseract user forum](https://groups.google.com/g/tesseract-ocr), the [Tesseract developer forum](https://groups.google.com/g/tesseract-dev) and [past issues](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues), and if you still can't find what you need, ask for support in the mailing-lists.\n\nMailing-lists:\n\n* [tesseract-ocr](https://groups.google.com/g/tesseract-ocr) - For tesseract users.\n* [tesseract-dev](https://groups.google.com/g/tesseract-dev) - For tesseract developers.\n\nPlease report an issue only for a **bug**, not for asking questions.\n\n## License\n\n    The code in this repository is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n**NOTE**: This software depends on other packages that may be licensed under different open source licenses.\n\nTesseract uses [Leptonica library](http://leptonica.com/) which essentially\nuses a [BSD 2-clause license](http://leptonica.com/about-the-license.html).\n\n## Dependencies\n\nTesseract uses [Leptonica library](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica)\nfor opening input images (e.g. not documents like pdf).\nIt is suggested to use leptonica with built-in support for [zlib](https://zlib.net),\n[png](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng) and\n[tiff](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff) (for multipage tiff).\n\n## Latest Version of README\n\nFor the latest online version of the README.md see:\n\n<https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/README.md>\n",
