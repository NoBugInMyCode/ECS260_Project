It is **not** a catch-all support forum. **For general support enquiries, please use the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js) at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js.** All questions involving the interplay between C3.js and any other library (such as AngularJS) should be posted there first!\n\nBefore reporting an issue, please do the following:\n\n1. [Search for existing issues](https://github.com/c3js/c3/issues) to ensure you're not posting a duplicate.\n\n1.  [Search the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js) to ensure it hasn't been addressed there already.\n\n1. Create a JSFiddle or Plunkr highlighting the issue. Please don't include any unnecessary dependencies so we can isolate that the issue is in fact with C3. *Please be advised that custom CSS can modify C3.js output!*\n\n1. When posting the issue, please use a descriptive title and include the version of C3 (or, if cloning from Git, the commit hash \u2014 C3 is under active development and the master branch contains the latest dev commits!), along with any platform/browser/OS information that may be relevant.\n\n## Pull requests\nPull requests are welcome, though please post an issue first to see whether such a change is desirable.\nIf you choose to submit a pull request, please do not bump the version number unless asked to, and please include test cases for any new features. Squash all your commits as well, please.\n\n## Playground\nPlease fork this fiddle:\n\n+ http://jsfiddle.net/7kYJu/4742/\n\n## Dependency\n\n+ [D3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) `^5.0.0`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
