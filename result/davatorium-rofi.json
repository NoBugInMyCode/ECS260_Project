Simpleswitcher laid\nthe foundations, and therefore Sean Pringle deserves most of the credit for\nthis tool. **Rofi** (renamed, as it lost the *simple* property) has been\nextended with extra features, like an application launcher and ssh-launcher,\nand can act as a drop-in dmenu replacement, making it a very versatile tool.\n\n**Rofi**, like dmenu, will provide the user with a textual list of options\nwhere one or more can be selected.\nThis can either be running an application, selecting a window, or options\nprovided by an external script.\n\n### What is rofi not?\n\nRofi is not:\n\n- A UI toolkit.\n\n- A library to be used in other applications.\n\n- An application that can support every possible use-case. It tries to be\n    generic enough to be usable by everybody.\n  - Specific functionality can be added using scripts or plugins, many exists.\n\n- Just a dmenu replacement. The dmenu functionality is a nice 'extra' to\n    **rofi**, not its main purpose.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Modes](#modes)\n- [Manpages](#manpage)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n  - [Usage](#usage)\n  - [Configuration](#configuration)\n  - [Themes](#themes)\n- [Screenshots](#screenshots)\n- [Wiki](#wiki)\n- [Discussion places](#discussion-places)\n\n## Features\n\nIts main features are:\n\n- Fully configurable keyboard navigation\n\n- Type to filter\n  - Tokenized: type any word in any order to filter\n  - Case insensitive (togglable)\n  - Support for fuzzy-, regex-, prefix-, and glob-matching\n\n- UTF-8 enabled\n  - UTF-8-aware string collating\n  - International keyboard support (\\`e -> \u00e8)\n\n- RTL language support\n\n- Cairo drawing and Pango font rendering\n\n- Built-in modes:\n  - Window switcher mode\n    - EWMH compatible WM\n    - Work arounds for i3,bspwm\n\n  - Application launcher\n\n  - Desktop file application launcher\n\n  - SSH launcher mode\n\n  - File browser\n\n  - Combi mode, allowing several modes to be merged into one list\n\n- History-based ordering \u2014 last 25 choices are ordered on top based on use\n    (optional)\n\n- Levenshtein distance or fzf like sorting of matches (optional)\n\n- Drop-in dmenu replacement\n  - Many added improvements\n\n- Easily extensible using scripts and plugins\n\n- Advanced Theming\n\n## Modes\n\n**Rofi** has several built-in modes implementing common use cases and can be\nextended by scripts (either called from\n**Rofi** or calling **Rofi**) or plugins.\n\nBelow is a list of the different modes:\n\n- **run**: launch applications from $PATH, with option to launch in terminal.\n\n- **drun**: launch applications based on desktop files. It tries to be\n    compliant to the XDG standard.\n\n- **window**: Switch between windows on an EWMH compatible window manager.\n\n- **ssh**: Connect to a remote host via ssh.\n\n- **filebrowser**: A basic file-browser for opening files.\n\n- **keys**: list internal keybindings.\n\n- **script**: Write (limited) custom mode using simple scripts.\n\n- **combi**: Combine multiple modes into one.\n\n**Rofi** is known to work on Linux and BSD.\n\n## Manpage\n\nFor more up to date information, please see the manpages. The other sections\nand links might have outdated information as they have relatively less\nmaintainance than the manpages. So, if you come across any issues please\nconsult manpages, [discussion](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/discussions)\nand [issue tracker](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues?q=) before filing\nnew issue.\n\n- Manpages:\n  - [rofi](doc/rofi.1.markdown)\n  - [rofi-theme](doc/rofi-theme.5.markdown)\n  - [rofi-debugging](doc/rofi-debugging.5.markdown)\n  - [rofi-script](doc/rofi-script.5.markdown)\n  - [rofi-theme-selector](doc/rofi-theme-selector.1.markdown)\n  - [rofi-thumbnails](doc/rofi-thumbnails.5.markdown)\n  - [rofi-keys](doc/rofi-keys.5.markdown)\n  - [rofi-dmenu](doc/rofi-dmenu.5.markdown)\n\n## Installation\n\nPlease see the [installation\nguide](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/INSTALL.md) for\ninstructions on how to install **Rofi**.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n### Usage\n\n> **This section just gives a brief overview of the various options. To get the\n> full set of options see the [manpages](#manpage) section above**\n\n#### Running rofi\n\nTo launch **rofi** directly in a certain mode, specify a mode with `rofi -show <mode>`.\nTo show the `run` dialog:\n\n```bash\n    rofi -show run\n```\n\nOr get the options from a script:\n\n```bash\n    ~/my_script.sh | rofi -dmenu\n```\n\nSpecify an ordered, comma-separated list of modes to enable. Enabled modes can\nbe changed at runtime. Default key is `Ctrl+Tab`. If no modes are specified,\nall configured modes will be enabled. To only show the `run` and `ssh`\nlauncher:\n\n```bash\n    rofi -modes \"run,ssh\" -show run\n```\n\nThe modes to combine in combi mode.\nFor syntax to `-combi-modes`, see `-modes`.\nTo get one merge view, of `window`,`run`, and `ssh`:\n\n```bash\n rofi -show combi -combi-modes \"window,run,ssh\" -modes combi\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nGenerate a default configuration file\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/rofi\nrofi -dump-config > ~/.config/rofi/config.rasi\n```\n\nThis creates a file called `config.rasi` in the `~/.config/rofi/` folder. You\ncan modify this file to set configuration settings and modify themes.\n`config.rasi` is the file rofi looks to by default.\n\nPlease see the [configuration\nguide](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/CONFIG.md) for a summary of\nconfiguration options. More detailed options are provided in the manpages.\n\n### Themes\n\nPlease see the [themes\nmanpages](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/doc/rofi-theme.5.markdown)\nfor a detailed description.\n\nThe latest bundled themes can be found\n[here](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/tree/next/themes).\n\n## Screenshots\n\nRezlooks:\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davatorium/rofi/next/releasenotes/1.6.0/icons.png)\n\nArthur:\n\n![screenshot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davatorium/rofi/next/releasenotes/1.6.0/icons2.png)\n\nDefault theme:\n\n![default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davatorium/rofi/next/releasenotes/1.4.0/rofi-no-fzf.png)\n\n## Wiki\n\n| \u2757 **The Wiki is currently unmaintained and might contain outdated data** |\n| --- |\n\n[Go to wiki](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/wiki) .\n\n### Contents\n\n- [User scripts](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/wiki/User-scripts)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/wiki#examples)\n- [dmenu Specs](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/wiki/dmenu_specs)\n- [mode Specs](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/wiki/mode-Specs)\n- [F.A.Q.](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).\n- [Script mode](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/wiki/rfc-script-mode)\n- [Creating an issue](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Creating a Pull request](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/wiki/Creating-a-pull-request)\n\n## Discussion places\n\nThe [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/discussions) is the\npreferred location for discussions.\n\n- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/discussions)\n- IRC (#rofi on irc.libera.chat)\n\n### Stargazers over time\n\n[![Stargazers over time](https://starchart.cc/davatorium/rofi.svg)](https://starchart.cc/davatorium/rofi)\n",
