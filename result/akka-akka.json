This model is a perfect match for the principles laid out in the [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/).\n\nFor resilience, we adopt the \"Let it crash\" model which the telecom industry has used with great success to build applications that self-heal and systems that never stop.\n\nActors also provide the abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.\n\nLearn more at [akka.io](https://akka.io/).\n\nReference Documentation\n-----------------------\n\nThe reference documentation is available at [doc.akka.io](https://doc.akka.io),\nfor [Scala](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/?language=scala) and [Java](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/?language=java).\n\nCurrent versions of all Akka libraries\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe current versions of all Akka libraries are listed on the [Akka Dependencies](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-dependencies/current/) page. Releases of the Akka core libraries in this repository are listed on the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/akka/akka/releases) page.\n\nCommunity\n---------\nYou can join these groups and chats to discuss and ask Akka related questions:\n\n- Forums: [discuss.akka.io](https://discuss.akka.io)\n- Issue tracker: [![github: akka/akka](https://img.shields.io/badge/github%3A-issues-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues)\n\nIn addition to that, you may enjoy following:\n\n- Questions tagged [#akka on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/akka)\n\nContributing\n------------\n**Contributions are *very* welcome!**\n\nIf you see an issue that you'd like to see fixed, or want to shape out some ideas,\nthe best way to make it happen is to help out by submitting a pull request implementing it.\nWe welcome contributions from all, even you are not yet familiar with this project,\nWe are happy to get you started, and will guide you through the process once you've submitted your PR.\n\nRefer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more details about the workflow,\nand general hints on how to prepare your pull request.
