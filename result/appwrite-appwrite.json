Sign up today!**](https://cloud.appwrite.io)\n\nAppwrite is an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker<nobr> microservices. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster.\n\nUsing Appwrite, you can easily integrate your app with user authentication and multiple sign-in methods, a database for storing and querying users and team data, storage and file management, image manipulation, Cloud Functions, and [more services](https://appwrite.io/docs).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <br />\n    <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/appwrite-2?utm_source=badge-top-post-badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-appwrite-2\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/top-post-badge.svg?post_id=360315&theme=light&period=daily\" alt=\"Appwrite - 100&#0037;&#0032;open&#0032;source&#0032;alternative&#0032;for&#0032;Firebase | Product Hunt\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 54px;\" width=\"250\" height=\"54\" /></a>\n    <br />\n    <br />\n</p>\n\n![Appwrite project dashboard showing various Appwrite features](public/images/github.png)\n\nFind out more at: [https://appwrite.io](https://appwrite.io).\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Self-Hosting](#self-hosting)\n  - [Unix](#unix)\n  - [Windows](#windows)\n    - [CMD](#cmd)\n    - [PowerShell](#powershell)\n  - [Upgrade from an Older Version](#upgrade-from-an-older-version)\n- [One-Click Setups](#one-click-setups)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  - [Services](#services)\n  - [SDKs](#sdks)\n    - [Client](#client)\n    - [Server](#server)\n    - [Community](#community)\n- [Architecture](#architecture)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Security](#security)\n- [Follow Us](#follow-us)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Getting Started\nThe easiest way to get started with Appwrite is by [signing up for Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/). While Appwrite Cloud is in public beta, you can build with Appwrite completely free, and we won't collect you credit card information. \n\n## Self-Hosting\n\nAppwrite is designed to run in a containerized environment. Running your server is as easy as running one command from your terminal. You can either run Appwrite on your localhost using docker-compose or on any other container orchestration tool, such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), or [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/).\n\nBefore running the installation command, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine:\n\n### Unix\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n    --volume \"$(pwd)\"/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw \\\n    --entrypoint=\"install\" \\\n    appwrite/appwrite:1.6.0\n```\n\n### Windows\n\n#### CMD\n\n```cmd\ndocker run -it --rm ^\n    --volume //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^\n    --volume \"%cd%\"/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw ^\n    --entrypoint=\"install\" ^\n    appwrite/appwrite:1.6.0\n```\n\n#### PowerShell\n\n```powershell\ndocker run -it --rm `\n    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock `\n    --volume ${pwd}/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw `\n    --entrypoint=\"install\" `\n    appwrite/appwrite:1.6.0\n```\n\nOnce the Docker installation is complete, go to http://localhost to access the Appwrite console from your browser. Please note that on non-Linux native hosts, the server might take a few minutes to start after completing the installation.\n\nFor advanced production and custom installation, check out our Docker [environment variables](https://appwrite.io/docs/environment-variables) docs. You can also use our public [docker-compose.yml](https://appwrite.io/install/compose) and [.env](https://appwrite.io/install/env) files to manually set up an environment.\n\n### Upgrade from an Older Version\n\nIf you are upgrading your Appwrite server from an older version, you should use the Appwrite migration tool once your setup is completed. For more information regarding this, check out the [Installation Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/self-hosting).\n\n## One-Click Setups\n\nIn addition to running Appwrite locally, you can also launch Appwrite using a pre-configured setup. This allows you to get up and running quickly with Appwrite without installing Docker on your local machine.\n\nChoose from one of the providers below:\n\n<table border=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n      <a href=\"https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/appwrite\">\n        <img width=\"50\" height=\"39\" src=\"public/images/integrations/digitalocean-logo.svg\" alt=\"DigitalOcean Logo\" />\n          <br /><sub><b>DigitalOcean</b></sub></a>\n        </a>\n    </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n      <a href=\"https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/appwrite/integration-for-gitpod\">\n        <img width=\"50\" height=\"39\" src=\"public/images/integrations/gitpod-logo.svg\" alt=\"Gitpod Logo\" />\n          <br /><sub><b>Gitpod</b></sub></a>    \n      </a>\n    </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.linode.com/marketplace/apps/appwrite/appwrite/\">\n        <img width=\"50\" height=\"39\" src=\"public/images/integrations/akamai-logo.svg\" alt=\"Akamai Logo\" />\n          <br /><sub><b>Akamai Compute</b></sub></a>    \n      </a>\n    </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n      <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-2hiaeo2px4md6\">\n        <img width=\"50\" height=\"39\" src=\"public/images/integrations/aws-logo.svg\" alt=\"AWS Logo\" />\n          <br /><sub><b>AWS Marketplace</b></sub></a>    \n      </a>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGetting started with Appwrite is as easy as creating a new project, choosing your platform, and integrating its SDK into your code. You can easily get started with your platform of choice by reading one of our Getting Started tutorials.\n\n| Platform              | Technology                                                                         |\n| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Web app**           | [Quick start for Web](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/web)                   |\n|                       | [Quick start for Next.js](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/nextjs)            |\n|                       | [Quick start for React](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/react)               |\n|                       | [Quick start for Vue.js](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/vue)                |\n|                       | [Quick start for Nuxt](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/nuxt)                 |\n|                       | [Quick start for SvelteKit](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/sveltekit)       |\n|                       | [Quick start for Refine](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/refine)             |\n|                       | [Quick start for Angular](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/angular)           |\n| **Mobile and Native** | [Quick start for React Native](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/react-native) |\n|                       | [Quick start for Flutter](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/flutter)           |\n|                       | [Quick start for Apple](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/apple)               |\n|                       | [Quick start for Android](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/android)           |\n| **Server**            | [Quick start for Node.js](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/node)              |\n|                       | [Quick start for Python](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/python)             |\n|                       | [Quick start for .NET](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/dotnet)               |\n|                       | [Quick start for Dart](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/dart)                 |\n|                       | [Quick start for Ruby](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/ruby)                 |\n|                       | [Quick start for Deno](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/deno)                 |\n|                       | [Quick start for PHP](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/php)                   |\n|                       | [Quick start for Kotlin](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/kotlin)             |\n|                       | [Quick start for Swift](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/swift)               |\n\n### Products\n\n- [**Account**](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account) - Manage current user authentication and account.

In addition, Appwrite supports multiple APIs, such as REST, WebSocket, and GraphQL to allow you to interact with your resources by leveraging your existing knowledge and protocols of choice.\n\nThe Appwrite API layer was designed to be extremely fast by leveraging in-memory caching and delegating any heavy-lifting tasks to the Appwrite background workers. The background workers also allow you to precisely control your compute capacity and costs using a message queue to handle the load. You can learn more about our architecture in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#architecture-1).\n\n## Contributing\n\nAll code contributions, including those of people having commit access, must go through a pull request and be approved by a core developer before being merged. This is to ensure a proper review of all the code.\n\nWe truly :heart: pull requests! If you wish to help, you can learn more about how you can contribute to this project in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Security\n\nFor security issues, kindly email us at [security@appwrite.io](mailto:security@appwrite.io) instead of posting a public issue on GitHub.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nJoin our growing community around the world!
