This repository is the original pure javascript implementation. All development effort has shifted to the new implementation which is written in Rust and so can easily be ported to other platforms. \n\n## Original Readme\n\n\ud83d\udcac [Join the Automerge Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/automerge/shared_invite/zt-e4p3760n-kKh7r3KRH1YwwNfiZM8ktw)\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/automerge/automerge/actions/workflows/automerge-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/automerge/automerge/actions/workflows/automerge-ci.yml)\n[![Browser Test Status](https://app.saucelabs.com/buildstatus/automerge)](https://app.saucelabs.com/open_sauce/user/automerge/builds)\n\nAutomerge is a library of data structures for building collaborative applications in JavaScript.\n\nPlease see [automerge.org](http://automerge.org/) for documentation.\n\nFor a set of extensible examples in TypeScript, see [automerge-repo](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo)\n\n## Setup\n\nIf you're using npm, `npm install automerge`. If you're using yarn, `yarn add automerge`. Then you\ncan import it with `require('automerge')` as in [the example below](#usage) (or\n`import * as Automerge from 'automerge'` if using ES2015 or TypeScript).\n\nOtherwise, clone this repository, and then you can use the following commands:\n\n- `yarn install` \u2014 installs dependencies.\n- `yarn test` \u2014\u00a0runs the test suite in Node.\n- `yarn run browsertest` \u2014 runs the test suite in web browsers.\n- `yarn build` \u2014 creates a bundled JS file `dist/automerge.js` for web browsers. It includes the\n  dependencies and is set up so that you can load through a script tag.\n\n## Meta\n\nCopyright 2017\u20132021, the Automerge contributors.
