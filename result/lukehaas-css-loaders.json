        "readme": "# [Single Element CSS Spinners](http://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders)\n\nThis is a collection of loading spinners animated with CSS.\n\nEach spinner consists of a single `div` with a class of `loader` and content text of \"Loading...\".\nThe text is for screen readers and can be used as a fallback state for older browsers.\n\nThe aim of this project was to create a set of minimal loading spinners that are visually appealing and also convey their intended meaning.\n\nA strict limit of one element per loader (not including pseudo-elements) was placed on this project based on the belief that something as simple as a loader doesn't deserve more.\n\nEach loader is given a font size in pixels and all other sizes are in ems so to change the size of a loader, just adjust the font-size.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![css-loaders-screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukehaas/css-loaders/step2/images/css-loaders-screenshot.jpg)](http://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders)\n\n> [Check it live](http://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders).\n\n## Browser Support\n\n![IE](https://raw.github.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/internet-explorer/internet-explorer_48x48.png) | ![Chrome](https://raw.github.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/chrome/chrome_48x48.png) | ![Firefox](https://raw.github.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/firefox/firefox_48x48.png) | ![Opera](https://raw.github.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/opera/opera_48x48.png) | ![Safari](https://raw.github.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/safari/safari_48x48.png)\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\nIE 10+ \u2714 | Chrome 4.0+ \u2714 | Firefox 16.0+ \u2714 | Opera 15.0+ \u2714 | Safari 4.0+ \u2714 |\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
