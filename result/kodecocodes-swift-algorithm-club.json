The focus is on clarity and readability of the code, not on making a reusable library that you can drop into your own projects. That said, most of the code should be ready for production use but you may need to tweak it to fit into your own codebase.\n\nCode is compatible with **Xcode 10** and **Swift 4.2**. We'll keep this updated with the latest version of Swift. If you're interested in a GitHub pages version of the repo, check out [this](https://aquarchitect.github.io/swift-algorithm-club/).\n\n:heart_eyes: **Suggestions and contributions are welcome!** :heart_eyes:\n\n## Important links\n\n[What are algorithms and data structures?](What%20are%20Algorithms.markdown) Pancakes!\n\n[Why learn algorithms?](Why%20Algorithms.markdown) Worried this isn't your cup of tea? Then read this.\n\n[Big-O notation](Big-O%20Notation.markdown). We often say things like, \"This algorithm is **O(n)**.\" If you don't know what that means, read this first.\n\n[Algorithm design techniques](Algorithm%20Design.markdown). How do you create your own algorithms?\n\n[How to contribute](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). Report an issue to leave feedback, or submit a pull request.\n\n## Where to start?\n\nIf you're new to algorithms and data structures, here are a few good ones to start out with:\n\n- [Stack](Stack/)\n- [Queue](Queue/)\n- [Insertion Sort](Insertion%20Sort/)\n- [Binary Search](Binary%20Search/) and [Binary Search Tree](Binary%20Search%20Tree/)\n- [Merge Sort](Merge%20Sort/)\n- [Boyer-Moore string search](Boyer-Moore-Horspool/)\n\n## The algorithms\n\n### Searching\n\n- [Linear Search](Linear%20Search/).

Swift's own `sort()` is more than up to the job. But if you're curious, read on...\n\nBasic sorts:\n\n- [Insertion Sort](Insertion%20Sort/)\n- [Selection Sort](Selection%20Sort/)\n- [Shell Sort](Shell%20Sort/)\n\nFast sorts:\n\n- [Quicksort](Quicksort/)\n- [Merge Sort](Merge%20Sort/)\n- [Heap Sort](Heap%20Sort/)\n\nHybrid sorts:\n\n- [Introsort](Introsort/)\n\nSpecial-purpose sorts:\n\n- [Counting Sort](Counting%20Sort/)\n- [Radix Sort](Radix%20Sort/)\n- [Topological Sort](Topological%20Sort/)\n\nBad sorting algorithms (don't use these!):\n\n- [Bubble Sort](Bubble%20Sort/)\n- [Slow Sort](Slow%20Sort/)\n\n### Compression\n\n- [Run-Length Encoding (RLE)](Run-Length%20Encoding/).

Probabilistic technique for approximating the global maxima in a (often discrete) large search space.\n\n## Data structures\n\nThe choice of data structure for a particular task depends on a few things.\n\nFirst, there is the shape of your data and the kinds of operations that you'll need to perform on it. If you want to look up objects by a key you need some kind of dictionary; if your data is hierarchical in nature you want a tree structure of some sort; if your data is sequential you want a stack or queue.\n\nSecond, it matters what particular operations you'll be performing most, as certain data structures are optimized for certain actions. For example, if you often need to find the most important object in a collection, then a heap or priority queue is more optimal than a plain array.\n\nMost of the time using just the built-in `Array`, `Dictionary`, and `Set` types is sufficient, but sometimes you may want something more fancy...\n\n### Variations on arrays\n\n- [Array2D](Array2D/). A two-dimensional array with fixed dimensions. Useful for board games.\n- [Bit Set](Bit%20Set/). A fixed-size sequence of *n* bits.\n- [Fixed Size Array](Fixed%20Size%20Array/). When you know beforehand how large your data will be, it might be more efficient to use an old-fashioned array with a fixed size.\n- [Ordered Array](Ordered%20Array/). An array that is always sorted.\n- [Rootish Array Stack](Rootish%20Array%20Stack/). A space and time efficient variation on Swift arrays.\n\n### Queues\n\n- [Stack](Stack/). Last-in, first-out!\n- [Queue](Queue/). First-in, first-out!\n- [Deque](Deque/). A double-ended queue.\n- [Priority Queue](Priority%20Queue). A queue where the most important element is always at the front.\n- [Ring Buffer](Ring%20Buffer/). Also known as a circular buffer. An array of a certain size that conceptually wraps around back to the beginning.\n\n### Lists\n\n- [Linked List](Linked%20List/). A sequence of data items connected through links. Covers both singly and doubly linked lists.\n- [Skip-List](Skip-List/). Skip List is a probabilistic data-structure with same logarithmic time bound and efficiency as AVL/ or Red-Black tree and provides a clever compromise to efficiently support search and update operations.\n\n### Trees\n\n- [Tree](Tree/). A general-purpose tree structure.\n- [Binary Tree](Binary%20Tree/). A tree where each node has at most two children.\n- [Binary Search Tree (BST)](Binary%20Search%20Tree/). A binary tree that orders its nodes in a way that allows for fast queries.\n- [Red-Black Tree](Red-Black%20Tree/). A self balancing binary search tree.\n- [Splay Tree](Splay%20Tree/). A self balancing binary search tree that enables fast retrieval of recently updated elements.\n- [Threaded Binary Tree](Threaded%20Binary%20Tree/). A binary tree that maintains a few extra variables for cheap and fast in-order traversals.\n- [Segment Tree](Segment%20Tree/). Can quickly compute a function over a portion of an array.\n  - [Lazy Propagation](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/tree/master/Segment%20Tree/LazyPropagation)\n- kd-Tree\n- [Sparse Table](Sparse%20Table/). Another take on quickly computing a function over a portion of an array, but this time we'll make it even quicker!.\n- [Heap](Heap/). A binary tree stored in an array, so it doesn't use pointers.

A self-balancing search tree, in which nodes can have more than two children.\n- [QuadTree](QuadTree/). A tree with 4 children.\n- [Octree](Octree/). A tree with 8 children.\n\n### Hashing\n\n- [Hash Table](Hash%20Table/). Allows you to store and retrieve objects by a key. This is how the dictionary type is usually implemented.\n- Hash Functions\n\n### Sets\n\n- [Bloom Filter](Bloom%20Filter/). A constant-memory data structure that probabilistically tests whether an element is in a set.\n- [Hash Set](Hash%20Set/). A set implemented using a hash table.\n- [Multiset](Multiset/). A set where the number of times an element is added matters. (Also known as a bag.)\n- [Ordered Set](Ordered%20Set/). A set where the order of items matters.\n\n### Graphs\n\n- [Graph](Graph/)\n- [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](Breadth-First%20Search/)\n- [Depth-First Search (DFS)](Depth-First%20Search/)\n- [Shortest Path](Shortest%20Path%20%28Unweighted%29/) on an unweighted tree\n- [Single-Source Shortest Paths](Single-Source%20Shortest%20Paths%20(Weighted)/)\n- [Minimum Spanning Tree](Minimum%20Spanning%20Tree%20%28Unweighted%29/) on an unweighted tree\n- [Minimum Spanning Tree](Minimum%20Spanning%20Tree/)\n- [All-Pairs Shortest Paths](All-Pairs%20Shortest%20Paths/)\n- [Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm](Dijkstra%20Algorithm/)\n- [A-Star](A-Star/)\n\n## Puzzles\n\nA lot of software developer interview questions consist of algorithmic puzzles.
