It was started on the 1st January 2022 and ran to the 31st March 2022 which is 90 Days! \n\nWhat started off as a learning in public project has quickly become a structured way of learning the foundations of DevOps principles, processes and tooling. Maybe you can help contribute some resources you have found useful to the project. \n\n- 2022 - Written content by myself but then translated and corrected and enhanced by the community \n- 2023 - Focus on Security and other topics we did not get to in 2022, Perspectives from communinty subject matter experts. \n- 2024 - Community Sessions by the community, 91 Sessions shared on YouTube. Different Media with intent to build out resources here as well. \n\n2025 - Where should we take this next? Are we finished? \n\nThis will **not cover all things** \"DevOps\" but it will cover some of the areas that will benefit your learning and understanding overall in this space. The encouragement here is to read & watch the content, be curious, provide feedback and discuss within the community your findings.\n\nThe project is not a sponsored operation by any vendors and everything is accessible using free, community and open source software. \n\n[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/N4N33YRCS)\n\n[![Discord Invite Link](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/vqwPrNQsyK)](https://discord.gg/vqwPrNQsyK)\n\n![GitHub Repo Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/michaelcade/90daysofdevops?style=social?)\n\nThe to images below will take you to the 2022, 2023 and 2024 editions of the learning journey. \n\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n  <div style=\"margin: 10px; text-align: center;\">\n    <a href=\"2022.md\">\n      <img src=\"2022.png?raw=true\" alt=\"2022\" style=\"border: 2px solid #555; border-radius: 8px; width: 100%; max-width: 400px;\" />\n    </a>\n    <br />\n    <em>Year 2022 - This is where we start, 110k words </em>\n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"margin: 10px; text-align: center;\">\n    <a href=\"2023.md\">\n      <img src=\"2023.png?raw=true\" alt=\"2023\" style=\"border: 2px solid #555; border-radius: 8px; width: 100%; max-width: 400px;\" />\n    </a>\n    <br />\n    <em>Year 2023 - Continues...
