Please check out [Dash for macOS](https://kapeli.com/dash) instead.\n\n# [Dash for iOS](https://kapeli.com/dash_ios)\n\nDash gives your iPad and iPhone instant offline access to 150+ API documentation sets.\n\nFor more information about Dash, check out https://kapeli.com/dash_ios.\n\nAlso please check out [Dash for macOS](https://kapeli.com/dash).\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\nThe recommended way of installing Dash is through the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-offline-api-docs/id1239167694?mt=8).\n\nAlternatively, you can use Xcode to install Dash on your iOS device using just your Apple ID.\n\nAll you need to do is:\n\n1. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)\n1. Download the [Dash for iOS Source Code](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-iOS/releases/latest) or `git clone https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-iOS.git`\n1. Open \"Dash iOS.xcworkspace\" in Xcode\n1. Go to Xcode's Preferences > Accounts and add your Apple ID\n1. In Xcode's sidebar select \"Dash iOS\" and go to General > Identity. Append a word at the end of the *Bundle Identifier* e.g. com.kapeli.dash.ios*.name* so it's unique. Select your Apple ID in Signing > Team\n1. Connect your iPad or iPhone using USB and select it in Xcode's Product menu > Destination\n1. Press CMD+R or Product > Run to install Dash\n1. If you install using a free (non-developer) account, make sure to rebuild Dash every 7 days, otherwise it will quit at launch when your certificate expires\n\n[Contact me](https://kapeli.com/contact) if you need help.\n\n## Contribution Guidelines\n\nI am currently only accepting pull requests that fix bugs or add/improve features. I can't allocate time to review pull requests that only refactor things or add comments.\n\nTry to maintain the same coding style I use (e.g. curly braces on their own line). I know it's a bit different from anyone else's and you might disagree with it, but having sections of code with a different style would make things worse.\n",
