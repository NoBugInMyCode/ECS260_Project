APFS ROM patching)\n* Graphics acceleration for both Metal and non-Metal GPUs\n\n----------\n\nNote: Only clean-installs and upgrades are supported. macOS Big Sur installs already patched with other patchers, such as [Patched Sur](https://github.com/BenSova/Patched-Sur) or [bigmac](https://github.com/StarPlayrX/bigmac), cannot be used due to broken file integrity with APFS snapshots and SIP.\n\n* You can, however, reinstall macOS with this patcher and retain your original data\n\nNote 2: Currently, OpenCore Legacy Patcher officially supports patching to run macOS Big Sur through Sonoma installs. For older OSes, OpenCore may function; however, support is currently not provided from Dortania.\n\n* For macOS Mojave and Catalina support, we recommend the use of [dosdude1's patchers](http://dosdude1.com)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo start using the project, please see our in-depth guide:\n\n* [OpenCore Legacy Patcher Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/)\n\n## Support\n\nThis project is offered on an AS-IS basis, we do not guarantee support for any issues that may arise. However, there is a community server with other passionate users and developers that can aid you:\n\n* [OpenCore Patcher Paradise Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rqdPgH8xSN)\n  * Keep in mind that the Discord server is maintained by the community, so we ask everyone to be respectful.\n  * Please review our docs on [how to debug with OpenCore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/DEBUG.html) to gather important information to help others with troubleshooting.\n\n## Running from source\n\nTo run the project from source, see here: [Build and run from source](./SOURCE.md)\n\n## Credits\n\n* [Acidanthera](https://github.com/Acidanthera)\n  * OpenCorePkg, as well as many of the core kexts and tools\n* [DhinakG](https://github.com/DhinakG)\n  * Main co-author\n* [Khronokernel](https://github.com/Khronokernel)\n  * Main co-author\n* [Ausdauersportler](https://github.com/Ausdauersportler)\n  * iMacs Metal GPUs Upgrade Patch set and documentation\n  * Great amounts of help with debugging, and code suggestions\n* [vit9696](https://github.com/vit9696)\n  * Endless amount of help troubleshooting, determining fixes and writing patches\n* [EduCovas](https://github.com/covasedu)\n  * [non-Metal patch set](https://github.com/moraea/non-metal-frameworks) for nVidia Tesla/Fermi/Maxwell/Pascal, AMD TeraScale 1/2, and Intel Core 1st/2nd Generation GPUs\n  * [3802 Metal patch set](https://github.com/moraea/misc-patches/tree/main/3802-Metal-15) and [MetallibSupportPkg](https://github.com/dortania/MetallibSupportPkg) for nVidia Kepler and Intel Core 3rd/4th Generation GPUs\n  * Metal bundle patches and shims for [nVidia Kepler](https://github.com/moraea/misc-patches/tree/main/Kepler%2013%2B), [AMD GCN 1 -
