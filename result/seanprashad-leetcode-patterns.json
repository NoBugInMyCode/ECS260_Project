Wish there was another feature?\nFeel free to open an [issue] with your suggestion!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis list is heavily inspired from [Grokking the Coding Interview] with\nadditional problems extracted from the [Blind 75 list] and this hackernoon article\non [14 patterns to ace any coding interview question].\n\n[leetcode.com]: https://leetcode.com\n[leetcode premium]: https://leetcode.com/subscribe/\n[this pdf]: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ao4ZA28zzBttDkuS6MLQI52gDs_CJZEm\n[solutions]: https://github.com/SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns/tree/solutions\n[grokking the coding interview]: https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview\n[issue]: https://github.com/SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns/issues/new\n[blind 75 list]: https://www.teamblind.com/article/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app\n[14 patterns to ace any coding interview question]: https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed\n",
