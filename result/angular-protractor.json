Protractor is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) program built on top of [WebDriverJS](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs). Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nProtractor 5 is compatible with nodejs v6 and newer.\n\nProtractor works with AngularJS versions greater than 1.0.6/1.1.4, and is compatible with Angular applications. Note that for Angular apps, the `binding` and `model` locators are not supported. We recommend using `by.css`.\n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\nSee the [Protractor Website](http://www.protractortest.org) for most documentation.\n\nTo get set up and running quickly:\n - Work through the [Tutorial](http://www.protractortest.org/#/tutorial)\n - See the [API](http://www.protractortest.org/#/api)\n\nOnce you are familiar with the tutorial, you\u2019re ready to move on. To modify your environment, see the Protractor Setup docs. To start writing tests, see the Protractor Tests docs.\n\nTo better understand how Protractor works with the Selenium WebDriver and Selenium Server see the reference materials.\n\n\nGetting Help\n------------\n\nCheck the [Protractor FAQ](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/faq.md) and read through the [Top 20 questions on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/protractor?sort=votes&pageSize=20).\n\nPlease ask usage and debugging questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/protractor) (use the [\"protractor\"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=protractor) tag), the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/angular/protractor) chat room, or in the [Angular discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/angular). (Please do not ask support questions here on Github.)\n\n\nFor Contributors\n----------------\nSee [DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md)\n",
