Its major\nfunctions include: file storing, file syncing and file accessing (file uploading\nand file downloading), and it can resolve the high capacity and load balancing\nproblem. FastDFS should meet the requirement of the website whose service based\non files such as photo sharing site and video sharing site.\n\nFastDFS has two roles: tracker and storage. The tracker takes charge of\nscheduling and load balancing for file access. The storage store files and it's\nfunction is file management including: file storing, file syncing, providing file\naccess interface. It also manage the meta data which are attributes representing\nas key value pair of the file. For example: width=1024, the key is \"width\" and\nthe value is \"1024\".\n\nThe tracker and storage contain one or more servers. The servers in the tracker\nor storage cluster can be added to or removed from the cluster by any time without\naffecting the online services. The servers in the tracker cluster are peer to peer.\n\nThe storarge servers organizing by the file volume/group to obtain high capacity.\nThe storage system contains one or more volumes whose files are independent among\nthese volumes. The capacity of the whole storage system equals to the sum of all\nvolumes' capacity. A file volume contains one or more storage servers whose files\nare same among these servers. The servers in a file volume backup each other,\nand all these servers are load balancing. When adding a storage server to a\nvolume, files already existing in this volume are replicated to this new server\nautomatically, and when this replication done, system will switch this server\nonline to providing storage services.\n\nWhen the whole storage capacity is insufficiency, you can add one or more\nvolumes to expand the storage capacity. To do this, you need to add one or\nmore storage servers.\n\nThe identification of a file is composed of two parts: the volume name and\nthe file name.\n\nClient test code use client library please refer to the directory: client/test.\n\nFor more FastDFS related articles, please subscribe the Wechat/Weixin public account\n(Chinese Language): fastdfs\n\nFastDFS is a lightweight object storage solution. If you need a general distributed\nfile system for databases, K8s and virtual machines (such as KVM), you can learn about\n[FastCFS](https://github.com/happyfish100/FastCFS) which achieves strong data consistency\nand high performance.\n\nWe provide technical support service and customized development.
