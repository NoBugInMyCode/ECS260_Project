It integrates with just about every data source available and utilises a range of methods for data analysis, making that data easy to navigate. \n\nSpiderFoot has an embedded web-server for providing a clean and intuitive web-based interface but can also be used completely via the command-line.  It's written in **Python 3** and **MIT-licensed**.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.spiderfoot.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/opensource-screenshot-v4.png\" />\n\n### FEATURES\n\n- Web based UI or CLI\n- Over 200 modules (see below)\n- Python 3.7+\n- YAML-configurable [correlation engine](/correlations/README.md) with [37 pre-defined rules](/correlations)\n- CSV/JSON/GEXF export\n- API key export/import\n- SQLite back-end for custom querying\n- Highly configurable\n- Fully documented\n- Visualisations\n- TOR integration for dark web searching\n- Dockerfile for Docker-based deployments\n- Can call other tools like DNSTwist, Whatweb, Nmap and CMSeeK\n- [Actively developed since 2012!](https://medium.com/@micallst/lessons-learned-from-my-10-year-open-source-project-4a4c8c2b4f64)\n\n### WANT MORE?\n\nNeed more from SpiderFoot? Check out [SpiderFoot HX](https://www.spiderfoot.net/hx) for:\n- 100% Cloud-based and managed for you\n- Attack Surface Monitoring with change notifications by email, REST and Slack\n- Multiple targets per scan\n- Multi-user collaboration\n- Authenticated and 2FA\n- Investigations\n- Customer support\n- Third party tools pre-installed & configured\n- Drive it with a fully RESTful API\n- TOR integration built-in\n- Screenshotting\n- Bring your own Python SpiderFoot modules\n- Feed scan data to Splunk, ElasticSearch and REST endpoints\n\nSee the full set of differences between SpiderFoot HX and the open source version [here](https://www.spiderfoot.net/open-source-vs-hx/).\n\n### USES\n\nSpiderFoot can be used offensively (e.g. in a red team exercise or penetration test) for reconnaissance of your target or defensively to gather information about what you or your organisation might have exposed over the Internet.\n\nYou can target the following entities in a SpiderFoot scan:\n\n - IP address\n - Domain/sub-domain name\n - Hostname\n - Network subnet (CIDR)\n - ASN\n - E-mail address\n - Phone number\n - Username\n - Person's name\n - Bitcoin address\n \nSpiderFoot's 200+ modules feed each other in a publisher/subscriber model to ensure maximum data extraction to do things like:\n\n- [Host/sub-domain/TLD enumeration/extraction](https://asciinema.org/a/295912)\n- [Email address, phone number and human name extraction](https://asciinema.org/a/295947)\n- [Bitcoin and Ethereum address extraction](https://asciinema.org/a/295957)\n- [Check for susceptibility to sub-domain hijacking](https://asciinema.org/a/344377)\n- DNS zone transfers\n- [Threat intelligence and Blacklist queries](https://asciinema.org/a/295949)\n- API integration with [SHODAN](https://asciinema.org/a/127601), [HaveIBeenPwned](https://asciinema.org/a/128731), [GreyNoise](https://asciinema.org/a/295943), AlienVault, SecurityTrails, etc.\n- [Social media account enumeration](https://asciinema.org/a/295923)\n- [S3/Azure/Digitalocean bucket enumeration/scraping](https://asciinema.org/a/295941)\n- IP geo-location\n- Web scraping, web content analysis\n- [Image, document and binary file meta data analysis](https://asciinema.org/a/296274)\n- Dark web searches\n- [Port scanning and banner grabbing](https://asciinema.org/a/295939)\n- [Data breach searches](https://asciinema.org/a/296145)\n- So much more...\n\n### INSTALLING & RUNNING\n\nTo install and run SpiderFoot, you need at least Python 3.7 and a number of Python libraries which you can install with `pip`. We recommend you install a packaged release since master will often have bleeding edge features and modules that aren't fully tested.\n\n#### Stable build (packaged release):\n\n```\n wget https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot/archive/v4.0.tar.gz\n tar zxvf v4.0.tar.gz\n cd spiderfoot-4.0\n pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n python3 ./sf.py -l 127.0.0.1:5001\n```\n\n#### Development build (cloning git master branch):\n\n```\n git clone https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot.git\n cd spiderfoot\n pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n python3 ./sf.py -l 127.0.0.1:5001\n```\n\nCheck out the [documentation](https://www.spiderfoot.net/documentation) and our [asciinema videos](https://asciinema.org/~spiderfoot) for more tutorials.\n\n### COMMUNITY\n\nWhether you're a contributor, user or just curious about SpiderFoot and OSINT in general, we'd love to have you join our community! SpiderFoot now has a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vyvztrG) for seeking help from the community, requesting features or just general OSINT chit-chat.\n\n### WRITING CORRELATION RULES\n\nWe have a comprehensive write-up and reference of the correlation rule-set introduced in SpiderFoot 4.0 [here](/correlations/README.md).\n\nAlso take a look at the [template.yaml](/correlations/template.yaml) file for a walk through. The existing [37 rules](/correlations) are also quite readable and good as starting points for additional rules.\n\n### MODULES / INTEGRATIONS\n\nSpiderFoot has over 200 modules, most of which *don't require API keys*, and many of those that do require API keys *have a free tier*.\n\n| Name     | Description | Type   |\n|:---------|
