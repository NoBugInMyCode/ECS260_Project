Our HTML/CSS components have been tested across every major email client to ensure consistency. And with the [Inky](https://github.com/zurb/inky) templating language, writing HTML emails is now even easier.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe main way to get started is with our [email template stack](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails-template). To use the stack, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) no greater than version 10 installed on your machine.\n\n`nvm` installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)\n\nTo set up the emails template, run these commands:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails-template project\ncd project\nnvm install 10\nnvm use 10\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen run `npm start` to run the project. A new browser window will open with a BrowserSync server showing the finished files.\n\nRun `npm run build` to do a full email inlining process.\n\n\n#### Using the Ruby gem\n\n**foundation_emails** is a gem that enables you to use Foundation for Emails assets within a Rails project. To install in your app:\n\n1. Add the following line to your Gemfile:\n\n  ```ruby\n  gem 'foundation_emails'\n  ```\n\n2. Then execute:\n\n  ```bash\n  bundle install\n  ```\n\n3. Import Foundation for Emails in your emails' stylesheet(s):\n\n  ```scss\n  // app/assets/stylesheets/your_emails_stylesheet.scss\n\n  @import \"foundation-emails\";\n  ```\n\nAdding Inky's templating capabilities to Rails is easy thanks to the [**inky-rb**](https://github.com/zurb/inky-rb) gem, which bundles `foundation_emails` by default.\n\n## Documentation\n\n**Check out our [Migration Guide](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails/blob/master/migration.md) for upgrading an existing template or for more in-depth code examples.**\n\nFoundation for Emails 2.0 documentation and framework are on the `develop` branch and you can compile it on your own machine.\n\nRun these commands to set up the documentation:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails.git\ncd foundation-emails\n```\n\nFoundation for Emails 2.0 documentation is on the `develop` branch.\n\n```bash\ngit fetch\ngit checkout develop\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen run `npm start` to compile the documentation. When it finishes, a new browser window will open pointing to a BrowserSync server displaying the documentation.\n\n## Testing\n\nRun `npm run test:visual` to compile the visual regression tests. All of the pages under `test/visual/pages` are compiled and inlined. From there, they can be uploaded to Litmus for testing.\n\n## Inky\n\n[Inky](https://github.com/zurb/inky) is our new templating language that converts simple HTML into the complex tables required for email layout.\n\nThe parser converts a set of custom HTML tags, expanding them out into full HTML syntax. Below is a list of every custom element.\n\n### Grid\n\n```html\n<container>\n  <row>\n    <column small=\"12\" large=\"4\"></column>\n    <column small=\"12\" large=\"8\"></column>\n  </row>\n</container>\n```\n\n### Block Grid\n\n```html\n<block-grid up=\"3\">\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n</block-grid>\n```\n\n### Components\n\n```html\n<button href=\"http://zurb.com\"></button>\n```\n\n```html\n<menu>\n  <item href=\"one.html\">Item One</item>\n  <item href=\"one.html\">Item Two</item>\n  <item href=\"one.html\">Item Three</item>\n</menu>\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nAs an open source project, we looooove our community support. Please file issues, or better yet pull requests on the [Foundation for Emails Repo](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails).
