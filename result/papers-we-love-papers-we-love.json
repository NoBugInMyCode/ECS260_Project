This repository serves as a directory of some of the best papers the community can find, bringing together documents scattered across the web. You can also visit the [Papers We Love site](http://paperswelove.org/) for more info.\n\nDue to [licenses](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#respect-content-licenses) we cannot always host the papers themselves (when we do, you will see a :scroll: emoji next to its title in the directory README) but we can provide links to their locations.\n\nIf you enjoy the papers, perhaps stop by a local chapter meetup and join in on the vibrant discussions around them. You can also discuss *PWL* events, the content in this repository, and/or anything related to *PWL* on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Tu2VynkRWV) server.\n\n### Chapters\n\nLet us know if you are interested in [starting one](https://github.com/papers-we-love/organizers) in your city!\n\nAll of our meetups follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### Past Presentations\n\nCheck out our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/PapersWeLove) channel for videos and video playlists.\n\n## Info\n\nWe're looking for pull requests related to papers we should add, better organization of the papers we do have, and/or links to other paper-repos we should point to.\n\n### Other Good Places to Find Papers\n\n* [2 Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz)\n* [Bell System Technical Journal, 1922-1983](https://www.bell-labs.com/our-research/technical-journal/)\n* [Best Paper Awards in Computer Science](http://jeffhuang.com/best_paper_awards.html)\n* [Facebook](https://research.facebook.com/publications/)\n* [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng) (choose a subcategory)\n* [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publications/)\n* [Functional Programming Books Review](http://alexott.net/en/fp/books/)\n* [MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab Publications](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/39813)\n* [MIT's Distributed System's Reading Group](http://dsrg.pdos.csail.mit.edu/)\n* [arXiv Paper Repository](http://arxiv.org/)\n* [SciRate](https://scirate.com/)\n* [cat-v.org](http://doc.cat-v.org/)\n* [y-archive](http://yarchive.net/comp/index.html)\n* [netlib](http://www.netlib.org/)\n* [Services Engineering Reading List](https://github.com/mmcgrana/services-engineering)\n* [Readings in Distributed Systems](http://christophermeiklejohn.com/distributed/systems/2013/07/12/readings-in-distributed-systems.html)\n* [Gradual Typing Bibliography](http://samth.github.io/gradual-typing-bib/)\n* [Security Data Science Papers](http://www.covert.io/the-definitive-security-datascience-and-machinelearning-guide/)\n* [Research Papers from Robert Harper, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/index.html)\n* [Lobste.rs tagged as PDF](https://lobste.rs/t/pdf)\n* [The Morning Paper](http://blog.acolyer.org/)\n* [eugeneyan/applied-ml GitHub repository](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml)\n\nPlease check out our [wiki-page](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/wiki/Other-Good-Sources-of-Reading-Material) for links to blogs, books, exchanges that are worth a good read.\n\n### How To Read a Paper\n\nReading a paper is not the same as reading a blogpost or a novel.
