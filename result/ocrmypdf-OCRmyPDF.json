Docker images are also available, for both x64 and ARM.\n\n| Operating system              | Install command               |\n| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------|\n| Debian, Ubuntu                | ``apt install ocrmypdf``      |\n| Windows Subsystem for Linux   | ``apt install ocrmypdf``      |\n| Fedora                        | ``dnf install ocrmypdf``      |\n| macOS (Homebrew)              | ``brew install ocrmypdf``     |\n| macOS (MacPorts)              | ``port install ocrmypdf``     |\n| macOS (nix)                   | ``nix-env -i ocrmypdf``       |\n| LinuxBrew                     | ``brew install ocrmypdf``     |\n| FreeBSD                       | ``pkg install py-ocrmypdf``   |\n| Ubuntu Snap                   | ``snap install ocrmypdf``     |\n\nFor everyone else, [see our documentation](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for installation steps.\n\n## Languages\n\nOCRmyPDF uses Tesseract for OCR, and relies on its language packs. For Linux users, you can often find packages that provide language packs:\n\n```bash\n# Display a list of all Tesseract language packs\napt-cache search tesseract-ocr\n\n# Debian/Ubuntu users\napt-get install tesseract-ocr-chi-sim  # Example: Install Chinese Simplified language pack\n\n# Arch Linux users\npacman -S tesseract-data-eng tesseract-data-deu # Example: Install the English and German language packs\n\n# brew macOS users\nbrew install tesseract-lang\n```\n\nYou can then pass the `-l LANG` argument to OCRmyPDF to give a hint as to what languages it should search for. Multiple languages can be requested.\n\nOCRmyPDF supports Tesseract 4.1.1+. It will automatically use whichever version it finds first on the `PATH` environment variable. On Windows, if `PATH` does not provide a Tesseract binary, we use the highest version number that is installed according to the Windows Registry.\n\n## Documentation and support\n\nOnce OCRmyPDF is installed, the built-in help which explains the command syntax and options can be accessed via:\n\n```bash\nocrmypdf --help\n```\n\nOur [documentation is served on Read the Docs](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n\nPlease report issues on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF/issues) page, and follow the issue template for quick response.\n\n## Feature demo\n\n```bash\n# Add an OCR layer and convert to PDF/A\nocrmypdf input.pdf output.pdf\n\n# Convert an image to single page PDF\nocrmypdf input.jpg output.pdf\n\n# Add OCR to a file in place (only modifies file on success)\nocrmypdf myfile.pdf myfile.pdf\n\n# OCR with non-English languages (look up your language's ISO 639-3 code)\nocrmypdf -l fra LeParisien.pdf LeParisien.pdf\n\n# OCR multilingual documents\nocrmypdf -l eng+fra Bilingual-English-French.pdf Bilingual-English-French.pdf\n\n# Deskew (straighten crooked pages)\nocrmypdf --deskew input.pdf output.pdf\n```\n\nFor more features, see the [documentation](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn addition to the required Python version, OCRmyPDF requires external program installations of Ghostscript and Tesseract OCR. OCRmyPDF is pure Python, and runs on pretty much everything: Linux, macOS, Windows and FreeBSD.\n\n## Press & Media\n\n- [Going paperless with OCRmyPDF](https://medium.com/@ikirichenko/going-paperless-with-ocrmypdf-e2f36143f46a)\n- [Converting a scanned document into a compressed searchable PDF with redactions](https://medium.com/@treyharris/converting-a-scanned-document-into-a-compressed-searchable-pdf-with-redactions-63f61c34fe4c)\n- [c't 1-2014, page 59](https://heise.de/-2279695): Detailed presentation of OCRmyPDF v1.0 in the leading German IT magazine c't\n- [heise Open Source, 09/2014: Texterkennung mit OCRmyPDF](https://heise.de/-2356670)\n- [heise Durchsuchbare PDF-Dokumente mit OCRmyPDF erstellen](https://www.heise.de/ratgeber/Durchsuchbare-PDF-Dokumente-mit-OCRmyPDF-erstellen-4607592.html)\n- [Excellent Utilities: OCRmyPDF](https://www.linuxlinks.com/excellent-utilities-ocrmypdf-add-ocr-text-layer-scanned-pdfs/)\n- [LinuxUser Texterkennung mit OCRmyPDF und Scanbd automatisieren](https://www.linux-community.de/ausgaben/linuxuser/2021/06/texterkennung-mit-ocrmypdf-und-scanbd-automatisieren/)\n- [Y Combinator discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028752)\n\n## Business enquiries\n\nOCRmyPDF would not be the software that it is today without companies and users choosing to provide support for feature development and consulting enquiries.
