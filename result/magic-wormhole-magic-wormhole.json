The two endpoints are\nidentified by using identical \"wormhole codes\": in general, the sending\nmachine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into the\nreceiving machine.\n\nThe codes are short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinct\nwordlist. The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords, so\nusually only a few characters must be typed. Wormhole codes are single-use\nand do not need to be memorized.\n\n* PyCon 2016 presentation: [Slides](http://www.lothar.com/~warner/MagicWormhole-PyCon2016.pdf), [Video](https://youtu.be/oFrTqQw0_3c)\n\nFor complete documentation, please see https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io\nor the docs/ subdirectory.\n\nThis program uses two servers, whose source code is kept in separate\nrepositories: the\n[mailbox server](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole-mailbox-server),\nand the\n[transit relay](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole-transit-relay).\n\n## License, Compatibility\n\nMagic-Wormhole is released under the MIT license, see the `LICENSE` file for details.\n\nThis library is compatible with Python 3.8 and higher (tested against\nversions up to 3.12).\n\n## Packaging, Installation\n\nMagic Wormhole packages are included in many operating systems.\n\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/magic-wormhole.svg)](https://repology.org/project/magic-wormhole/versions)\n\nTo install it without an OS package, follow the [Installation docs](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html#installation).\n",
