You can also pass data from the HTTP request (such as headers, payload or query variables) to your commands. [webhook][w] also allows you to specify rules which have to be satisfied in order for the hook to be triggered.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you're using Github or Bitbucket, you can use [webhook][w] to set up a hook that runs a redeploy script for your project on your staging server, whenever you push changes to the master branch of your project.\r\n\r\nIf you use Mattermost or Slack, you can set up an \"Outgoing webhook integration\" or \"Slash command\" to run various commands on your server, which can then report back directly to you or your channels using the \"Incoming webhook integrations\", or the appropriate response body.\r\n\r\n[webhook][w] aims to do nothing more than it should do, and that is:\r\n 1. receive the request,\r\n 2. parse the headers, payload and query variables,\r\n 3. check if the specified rules for the hook are satisfied,\r\n 3. and finally, pass the specified arguments to the specified command via\r\n    command line arguments or via environment variables.\r\n\r\nEverything else is the responsibility of the command's author.\r\n\r\n## Not what you're looking for?\r\n| <a href=\"https://www.hookdoo.com/?github\"><img src=\"https://hookdoo.com/img/Hookdoo_Logo_1.png\" height=\"48\" alt=\"hookdoo\" /></a> | <picture><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"images/hookdeck-white.svg\"><img height=\"36\" alt=\"hookdeck\" src=\"images/hookdeck-black.svg\"></picture></a> |\r\n| :-: | :-: |\r\n| Scriptable webhook gateway to safely run your custom builds, deploys, and proxy scripts on your servers.                                      | An event gateway to reliably ingest, verify, queue, transform, filter, inspect, monitor, and replay webhooks. |\r\n \r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n## Installation\r\n### Building from source\r\nTo get started, first make sure you've properly set up your [Go](http://golang.org/doc/install) 1.21 or newer environment and then run\r\n```bash\r\n$ go build github.com/adnanh/webhook\r\n```\r\nto build the latest version of the [webhook][w].\r\n\r\n### Using package manager\r\n#### Snap store\r\n[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/webhook)\r\n\r\n#### Ubuntu\r\nIf you are using Ubuntu linux (17.04 or later), you can install webhook using `sudo apt-get install webhook` which will install community packaged version.\r\n\r\n#### Debian\r\nIf you are using Debian linux (\"stretch\" or later), you can install webhook using `sudo apt-get install webhook` which will install community packaged version (thanks [@freeekanayaka](https://github.com/freeekanayaka)) from https://packages.debian.org/sid/webhook\r\n\r\n#### FreeBSD\r\nIf you are using FreeBSD, you can install webhook using `pkg install webhook`.\r\n\r\n### Download prebuilt binaries\r\nPrebuilt binaries for different architectures are available at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/releases).\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nNext step is to define some hooks you want [webhook][w] to serve.\r\n[webhook][w] supports JSON or YAML configuration files, but we'll focus primarily on JSON in the following example.\r\nBegin by creating an empty file named `hooks.json`. This file will contain an array of hooks the [webhook][w] will serve. Check [Hook definition page](docs/Hook-Definition.md) to see the detailed description of what properties a hook can contain, and how to use them.\r\n\r\nLet's define a simple hook named `redeploy-webhook` that will run a redeploy script located in `/var/scripts/redeploy.sh`. Make sure that your bash script has `#!/bin/sh` shebang on top.\r\n\r\nOur `hooks.json` file will now look like this:\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": \"redeploy-webhook\",\r\n    \"execute-command\": \"/var/scripts/redeploy.sh\",\r\n    \"command-working-directory\": \"/var/webhook\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** If you prefer YAML, the equivalent `hooks.yaml` file would be:\r\n```yaml\r\n- id: redeploy-webhook\r\n  execute-command: \"/var/scripts/redeploy.sh\"\r\n  command-working-directory: \"/var/webhook\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now run [webhook][w] using\r\n```bash\r\n$ /path/to/webhook -hooks hooks.json -verbose\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will start up on default port 9000 and will provide you with one HTTP endpoint\r\n```http\r\nhttp://yourserver:9000/hooks/redeploy-webhook\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck [webhook parameters page](docs/Webhook-Parameters.md) to see how to override the ip, port and other settings such as hook hotreload, verbose output, etc, when starting the [webhook][w].\r\n\r\nBy performing a simple HTTP GET or POST request to that endpoint, your specified redeploy script would be executed. Neat!\r\n\r\nHowever, hook defined like that could pose a security threat to your system, because anyone who knows your endpoint, can send a request and execute your command. To prevent that, you can use the `\"trigger-rule\"` property for your hook, to specify the exact circumstances under which the hook would be triggered. For example, you can use them to add a secret that you must supply as a parameter in order to successfully trigger the hook. Please check out the [Hook rules page](docs/Hook-Rules.md) for detailed list of available rules and their  usage.\r\n\r\n## Multipart Form Data\r\n[webhook][w] provides limited support the parsing of multipart form data.\r\nMultipart form data can contain two types of parts: values and files.\r\nAll form _values_ are automatically added to the `payload` scope.\r\nUse the `parse-parameters-as-json` settings to parse a given value as JSON.\r\nAll files are ignored unless they match one of the following criteria:\r\n\r\n1. The `Content-Type` header is `application/json`.\r\n1. The part is named in the `parse-parameters-as-json` setting.\r\n\r\nIn either case, the given file part will be parsed as JSON and added to the `payload` map.\r\n\r\n## Templates\r\n[webhook][w] can parse the hooks configuration file as a Go template when given the `-template` [CLI parameter](docs/Webhook-Parameters.md). See the [Templates page](docs/Templates.md) for more details on template usage.\r\n\r\n## Using HTTPS\r\n[webhook][w] by default serves hooks using http. If you want [webhook][w] to serve secure content using https, you can use the `-secure` flag while starting [webhook][w]. Files containing a certificate and matching private key for the server must be provided using the `-cert /path/to/cert.pem` and `-key /path/to/key.pem` flags. If the certificate is signed by a certificate authority, the cert file should be the concatenation of the server's certificate followed by the CA's certificate.\r\n\r\nTLS version and cipher suite selection flags are available from the command line. To list available cipher suites, use the `-list-cipher-suites` flag.  The `-tls-min-version` flag can be used with `-list-cipher-suites`.\r\n\r\n## Running behind a reverse proxy\r\n[webhook][w] may be run behind a \"reverse proxy\" - another web-facing server such as [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.org) or [Nginx](https://nginx.org) that accepts requests from clients and forwards them on to [webhook][h].  You can have [webhook][w] listen on a regular TCP port or on a Unix domain socket (with the `-socket` flag), then configure your proxy to send requests for a specific host name or sub-path over that port or socket to [webhook][w].\r\n\r\nNote that when running in this mode the [`ip-whitelist`](docs/Hook-Rules.md#match-whitelisted-ip-range) trigger rule will not work as expected, since it will be checking the address of the _proxy_, not the _client_.  Client IP restrictions will need to be enforced within the proxy, before it decides whether to forward the request to [webhook][w].\r\n\r\n## CORS Headers\r\nIf you want to set CORS headers, you can use the `-header name=value` flag while starting [webhook][w] to set the appropriate CORS headers that will be returned with each response.\r\n\r\n## Running under `systemd`\r\nOn platforms that use [systemd](https://systemd.io), [webhook][w] supports the _socket activation_ mechanism.  If [webhook][w] detects that it has been launched from a systemd-managed socket it will automatically use that instead of opening its own listening port.  See [the systemd page](docs/Systemd-Activation.md) for full details.\r\n\r\n## Interested in running webhook inside of a Docker container?\r\nYou can use one of the following Docker images, or create your own (please read [this discussion](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/issues/63)):\r\n- [almir/webhook](https://github.com/almir/docker-webhook)\r\n- [roxedus/webhook](https://github.com/Roxedus/docker-webhook)\r\n- [thecatlady/webhook](https://github.com/thecatlady/docker-webhook)\r\n- [lwlook/webhook](https://hub.docker.com/r/lwlook/webhook) - This setup allows direct access to the Docker host, providing a streamlined and efficient way to manage webhooks.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nCheck out [Hook examples page](docs/Hook-Examples.md) for more complex examples of hooks.\r\n\r\n### Guides featuring webhook\r\n - [Plex 2 Telegram](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1972594) by [@psyhomb](https://github.com/psyhomb)\r\n - [Webhook & JIRA](https://sites.google.com/site/mrxpalmeiras/more/jira-webhooks) by [@perfecto25](https://github.com/perfecto25)\r\n - [Trigger Ansible AWX job runs on SCM (e.g. git) commit](http://jpmens.net/2017/10/23/trigger-awx-job-runs-on-scm-commit/) by [@jpmens](http://mens.de/)\r\n - [Deploy using GitHub webhooks](https://davidauthier.wearemd.com/blog/deploy-using-github-webhooks.html) by [@awea](https://davidauthier.wearemd.com)\r\n - [Setting up Automatic Deployment and Builds Using Webhooks](https://willbrowning.me/setting-up-automatic-deployment-and-builds-using-webhooks/) by [Will Browning](https://willbrowning.me/about/)\r\n - [Auto deploy your Node.js app on push to GitHub in 3 simple steps](https://webhookrelay.com/blog/2018/07/17/auto-deploy-on-git-push/) by Karolis Rusenas\r\n - [Automate Static Site Deployments with Salt, Git, and Webhooks](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/configuration-management/automate-a-static-site-deployment-with-salt/) by [Linode](https://www.linode.com)\r\n - [Using Prometheus to Automatically Scale WebLogic Clusters on Kubernetes](https://blogs.oracle.com/weblogicserver/using-prometheus-to-automatically-scale-weblogic-clusters-on-kubernetes-v5) by [Marina Kogan](https://blogs.oracle.com/author/9a4fe754-1cc2-4c64-95fc-360642b62927)\r\n - [Github Pages and Jekyll - A New Platform for LACNIC Labs](https://labs.lacnic.net/a-new-platform-for-lacniclabs/) by [Carlos Mart\u00ednez Cagnazzo](https://twitter.com/carlosm3011)\r\n - [How to Deploy React Apps Using Webhooks and Integrating Slack on Ubuntu](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/how-to-deploy-react-apps-using-webhooks-and-integrating-slack-on-ubuntu_594116) by Arslan Ud Din Shafiq\r\n - [Private webhooks](https://ihateithe.re/2018/01/private-webhooks/) by [Thomas](https://ihateithe.re/colophon/)\r\n - [Adventures in webhooks](https://medium.com/@draketech/adventures-in-webhooks-2d6584501c62) by [Drake](https://medium.com/@draketech)\r\n - [GitHub pro tips](http://notes.spencerlyon.com/2016/01/04/github-pro-tips/) by [Spencer Lyon](http://notes.spencerlyon.com/)\r\n - [XiaoMi Vacuum + Amazon Button = Dash Cleaning](https://www.instructables.com/id/XiaoMi-Vacuum-Amazon-Button-Dash-Cleaning/) by [c0mmensal](https://www.instructables.com/member/c0mmensal/)\r\n - [Set up Automated Deployments From Github With Webhook](https://maximorlov.com/automated-deployments-from-github-with-webhook/) by [Maxim Orlov](https://twitter.com/_maximization)\r\n - [Kick Me Now with Webhooks](https://freebsdfoundation.org/kick-me-now-with-webhooks/) By Dave Cottlehuber\r\n - VIDEO: [Gitlab CI/CD configuration using Docker and adnanh/webhook to deploy on VPS - Tutorial #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhn-lXjyrZA&feature=youtu.be) by [Yes!
