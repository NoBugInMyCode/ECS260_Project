Mojo is still young, but it is designed\nto become the best way to extend Python over time.\n\nThis repo includes source code for:\n\n- Mojo examples\n- Mojo documentation hosted at [modular.com](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/)\n- The [Mojo standard library](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/lib)\n\nThis repo has two primary branches:\n\n- The [`main`](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/main) branch, which is in\nsync with the last stable released version of Mojo. Use the examples here if you\u2019re\nusing a [release build of Mojo](#latest-released).\n\n- The [`nightly`](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/nightly) branch, which\nis in sync with the Mojo nightly build and subject to breakage. Use this branch\nfor [contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md), or if you're using the latest\n[nightly build of Mojo](#latest-nightly).\n\nTo learn more about Mojo, see the\n[Mojo Manual](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/).\n\n## Installing Mojo\n\n### Latest Released\n\nTo install the last released build of Mojo, follow the guide to\n[Get started with Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started).\n\n### Latest Nightly\n\nThe nightly Mojo builds are subject to breakage and provide an inside\nview of how the development of Mojo is progressing.  Use at your own risk\nand be patient!\n\nTo get nightly builds, see the same instructions to [Get started with\nMojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started), but when you create\nyour project, instead use the following `magic init` command to set the\nconda package channel to `max-nightly`:\n\n```bash\nmagic init hello-world-nightly --format mojoproject \\\n  -c conda-forge -c https://conda.modular.com/max-nightly\n```\n\nOr, if you're [using conda](https://docs.modular.com/magic/conda), add the\n`https://conda.modular.com/max-nightly/` channel to your `environment.yaml`\nfile. For example:\n\n```yaml\n[project]\nname = \"Mojo nightly example\"\nchannels = [\"conda-forge\", \"https://conda.modular.com/max-nightly/\"]\nplatforms = [\"osx-arm64\", \"linux-aarch64\", \"linux-64\"]\n\n[dependencies]\nmax = \"*\"\n```\n\nAnd when you clone this repo, switch to the `nightly` branch because the `main`\nbranch might not be compatible with nightly builds:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/modularml/mojo.git\n```\n\n```bash\ngit checkout nightly\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWhen you want to report issues or request features, [please create a GitHub\nissue here](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues).\nSee [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on filing good bugs.\n\nWe welcome contributions to this repo on the\n[`nightly`](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/nightly)\nbranch. If you\u2019d like to contribute to Mojo, please first read our [Contributor\nGuide](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nFor more general questions or to chat with other Mojo developers, check out our\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/modular).\n\n## License\n\nThis repository and its contributions are licensed under the Apache License v2.0\nwith LLVM Exceptions (see the LLVM [License](https://llvm.org/LICENSE.txt)).\nMAX and Mojo usage and distribution are licensed under the\n[MAX & Mojo Community License](https://www.modular.com/legal/max-mojo-license).\n\n## Thanks to our contributors\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/modularml/mojo/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=modularml/mojo\" />\n</a>\n",
