It leverages CocoaTouch modules and is less invasive than CocoaPods.\n\nTo install with Carthage, follow the instruction on [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)\n\nCartfile\n```\ngithub \"CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack\"\n```\n\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nAs of CocoaLumberjack 3.6.0, you can use the Swift Package Manager as integration method.\nIf you want to use the Swift Package Manager as integration method, either use Xcode to add the package dependency or add the following dependency to your Package.swift:\n\n```swift\n.package(url: \"https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack.git\", from: \"3.8.0\"),\n```\n\nNote that you may need to add both products, `CocoaLumberjack` and `CocoaLumberjackSwift` to your target since SPM sometimes fails to detect that `CocoaLumberjackSwift` depends on `CocoaLumberjack`.\n\n### Install manually\n\nIf you want to install CocoaLumberjack manually, read the [manual installation](Documentation/GettingStarted.md#manual-installation) guide for more information.\n\n### Swift Usage\n\nUsually, you can simply `import CocoaLumberjackSwift`. If you installed CocoaLumberjack using CocoaPods, you need to use `import CocoaLumberjack` instead.\n\n```swift\nDDLog.add(DDOSLogger.sharedInstance) // Uses os_log\n\nlet fileLogger: DDFileLogger = DDFileLogger() // File Logger\nfileLogger.rollingFrequency = 60 * 60 * 24 // 24 hours\nfileLogger.logFileManager.maximumNumberOfLogFiles = 7\nDDLog.add(fileLogger)\n\n...\n\nDDLogVerbose(\"Verbose\")\nDDLogDebug(\"Debug\")\nDDLogInfo(\"Info\")\nDDLogWarn(\"Warn\")\nDDLogError(\"Error\")\n```\n\n### Obj-C usage\n\nIf you're using Lumberjack as a framework, you can `@import CocoaLumberjack;`.\nOtherwise, `#import <CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack.h>`\n\n```objc\n[DDLog addLogger:[DDOSLogger sharedInstance]]; // Uses os_log\n\nDDFileLogger *fileLogger = [[DDFileLogger alloc] init]; // File Logger\nfileLogger.rollingFrequency = 60 * 60 * 24; // 24 hour rolling\nfileLogger.logFileManager.maximumNumberOfLogFiles = 7;\n[DDLog addLogger:fileLogger];\n\n...\n\nDDLogVerbose(@\"Verbose\");\nDDLogDebug(@\"Debug\");\nDDLogInfo(@\"Info\");\nDDLogWarn(@\"Warn\");\nDDLogError(@\"Error\");\n```\n### Objective-C ARC Semantic Issue\n\nWhen integrating Lumberjack into an existing Objective-C it is possible to run into `Multiple methods named 'tag' found with mismatched result, parameter type or attributes` build error.\n\nAdd `#define DD_LEGACY_MESSAGE_TAG 0` before importing CocoaLumberjack or add `#define DD_LEGACY_MESSAGE_TAG 0` or add `-DDD_LEGACY_MESSAGE_TAG=0` to *Other C Flags*/*OTHER_CFLAGS* in your Xcode project.\n\n## [swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) backend\n\nCocoaLumberjack also ships with a backend implementation for [swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log).\nSimply add CocoaLumberjack as dependency to your SPM target (see above) and also add the `CocoaLumberjackSwiftLogBackend` product as dependency to your target.\n\nYou can then use `DDLogHandler` as backend for swift-log, which will forward all messages to CocoaLumberjack's `DDLog`. You will still configure the loggers and log formatters you want via `DDLog`, but writing log messages will be done using `Logger` from swift-log.\n\nIn your own log formatters, you can make use of the `swiftLogInfo` property on `DDLogMessage` to retrieve the details of a message that is logged via swift-log.\n\nTo use swift-log with CocoaLumberjack, take a look the following code snippet to see how to get started.\n\n```swift\nimport CocoaLumberjack\nimport CocoaLumberjackSwiftLogBackend\nimport Logging\n\n// In your application's entry point (e.g. AppDelegate):\nDDLog.add(DDOSLogger.sharedInstance) // Configure loggers\nLoggingSystem.bootstrapWithCocoaLumberjack() // Use CocoaLumberjack as swift-log backend\n```\n\n\n## More information\n\n- read the [Getting started](Documentation/GettingStarted.md) guide, check out the [FAQ](Documentation/FAQ.md) section or the other [docs](Documentation/)\n- if you find issues or want to suggest improvements, create an issue or a pull request\n- for all kinds of questions involving CocoaLumberjack, use the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/group/cocoalumberjack) or StackOverflow (use [#lumberjack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lumberjack)).\n\n\n## CocoaLumberjack 3\n\n### Migrating to 3.x\n\n* To be determined\n\n## Features\n\n### Lumberjack is Fast & Simple, yet Powerful & Flexible.\n\nIt is similar in concept to other popular logging frameworks such as log4j, yet is designed specifically for Objective-C, and takes advantage of features such as multi-threading, grand central dispatch (if available), lockless atomic operations, and the dynamic nature of the Objective-C runtime.\n\n### Lumberjack is Fast\n\nIn most cases it is an order of magnitude faster than NSLog.\n\n### Lumberjack is Simple\n\nIt takes as little as a single line of code to configure lumberjack when your application launches. Then simply replace your NSLog statements with DDLog statements and that's about it. (And the DDLog macros have the exact same format and syntax as NSLog, so it's super easy.)\n\n### Lumberjack is Powerful:\n\nOne log statement can be sent to multiple loggers, meaning you can log to a file and the console simultaneously. Want more? Create your own loggers (it's easy) and send your log statements over the network. Or to a database or distributed file system. The sky is the limit.\n\n### Lumberjack is Flexible:\n\nConfigure your logging however you want. Change log levels per file (perfect for debugging). Change log levels per logger (verbose console, but concise log file). Change log levels per xcode configuration (verbose debug, but concise release). Have your log statements compiled out of the release build. Customize the number of log levels for your application. Add your own fine-grained logging. Dynamically change log levels during runtime. Choose how & when you want your log files to be rolled. Upload your log files to a central server. Compress archived log files to save disk space...\n\n## This framework is for you if:\n\n-   You're looking for a way to track down that impossible-to-reproduce bug that keeps popping up in the field.\n-   You're frustrated with the super short console log on the iPhone.\n-   You're looking to take your application to the next level in terms of support and stability.\n-   You're looking for an enterprise level logging solution for your application (Mac or iPhone).\n\n## Documentation\n\n- **[Get started using Lumberjack](Documentation/GettingStarted.md)**<br/>\n- [Different log levels for Debug and Release builds](Documentation/XcodeTricks.md)<br/>\n- [Different log levels for each logger](Documentation/PerLoggerLogLevels.md)<br/>\n- [Use colors in the Xcode debugging console](Documentation/XcodeColors.md)<br/>\n- [Write your own custom formatters](Documentation/CustomFormatters.md)<br/>\n- [FAQ](Documentation/FAQ.md)<br/>\n- [Analysis of performance with benchmarks](Documentation/Performance.md)<br/>\n- [Common issues you may encounter and their solutions](Documentation/ProblemSolution.md)<br/>\n- [AppCode support](Documentation/AppCode-support.md)\n- **[Full Lumberjack documentation](Documentation/)**<br/>\n\n## Requirements\nThe current version of Lumberjack requires:\n- Xcode 14.1 or later\n- Swift 5.5 or later\n- macOS 10.13 or later\n- iOS 11 or later\n- tvOS 11 or later\n- watchOS 4 or later\n\n### Backwards compatibility\n- for iOS/tvOS up to 10, watchOS up to 3, macOS up to 10.12, Xcode up to 13 and Swift up to 5.4, use the 3.7.4 version\n- for Xcode 11 and Swift up to 5.2, use the 3.6.2 version\n- for Xcode 10 and Swift 4.2, use the 3.5.2 version\n- for iOS 8, use the 3.6.1 version\n- for iOS 6, iOS 7, OS X 10.8, OS X 10.9 and Xcode 9, use the 3.4.2 version\n- for iOS 5 and OS X 10.7, use the 3.3 version\n- for Xcode 8 and Swift 3, use the 3.2 version\n- for Xcode 7.3 and Swift 2.3, use the 2.4.0 version\n- for Xcode 7.3 and Swift 2.2, use the 2.3.0 version\n- for Xcode 7.2 and 7.1, use the 2.2.0 version\n- for Xcode 7.0 or earlier, use the 2.1.0 version\n- for Xcode 6 or earlier, use the 2.0.x version\n- for OS X < 10.7 support, use the 1.6.0 version\n\n## Communication\n\n- If you **need help**, use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lumberjack).
