        "readme": "# [FLAnimatedImage](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage) &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage/blob/master/LICENSE) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage/pulls)\n\nFLAnimatedImage is a performant animated GIF engine for iOS:\n\n- Plays multiple GIFs simultaneously with a playback speed comparable to desktop browsers\n- Honors variable frame delays\n- Behaves gracefully under memory pressure\n- Eliminates delays or blocking during the first playback loop\n- Interprets the frame delays of fast GIFs the same way modern browsers do\n\nIt's a well-tested [component that powers all GIFs in Flipboard](http://engineering.flipboard.com/2014/05/animated-gif). To understand its behavior it comes with an interactive demo:\n\n![Flipboard playing multiple GIFs](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage/raw/master/images/flanimatedimage-demo-player.gif)\n\n## Who is this for?\n\n- Apps that don't support animated GIFs yet\n- Apps that already support animated GIFs but want a higher performance solution\n- People who want to tinker with the code ([the corresponding blog post](http://engineering.flipboard.com/2014/05/animated-gif/) is a great place to start; also see the *To Do* section below)\n\n## Installation & Usage\n\nFLAnimatedImage is a well-encapsulated drop-in component. Simply replace your `UIImageView` instances with instances of `FLAnimatedImageView` to get animated GIF support. There is no central cache or state to manage.\n\nIf using CocoaPods, the quickest way to try it out is to type this on the command line:\n\n```shell\n$ pod try FLAnimatedImage\n```\n\nTo add it to your app, copy the two classes `FLAnimatedImage.h/.m` and `FLAnimatedImageView.h/.m` into your Xcode project or add via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) by adding this to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'FLAnimatedImage', '~> 1.0'\n```\n\nIf using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add the following line into your `Cartfile`\n\n```\ngithub \"Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage\"\n```\n\nIf using [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager), add the following to your `Package.swift` or add via XCode:\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"1.0.16\"))\n],\ntargets: [\n    .target(name: \"TestProject\", dependencies: [\"FLAnimatedImage\"\"])\n]\n```\n\nIn your code, `#import \"FLAnimatedImage.h\"`, create an image from an animated GIF, and setup the image view to display it:\n\n```objective-c\nFLAnimatedImage *image = [FLAnimatedImage animatedImageWithGIFData:[NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Rotating_earth_%28large%29.gif\"]]];\nFLAnimatedImageView *imageView = [[FLAnimatedImageView alloc] init];\nimageView.animatedImage = image;\nimageView.frame = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 100.0, 100.0);\n[self.view addSubview:imageView];\n```\n\nIt's flexible to integrate in your custom image loading stack and backwards compatible to iOS 9.\n\nIt uses ARC and the Apple frameworks `QuartzCore`, `ImageIO`, `MobileCoreServices`, and `CoreGraphics`.\n\nIt is capable of fine-grained logging. A block can be set on `FLAnimatedImage` that's invoked when logging occurs with various log levels via the `+setLogBlock:logLevel:` method. For example:\n\n```objective-c\n// Set up FLAnimatedImage logging.\n[FLAnimatedImage setLogBlock:^(NSString *logString, FLLogLevel logLevel) {\n    // Using NSLog\n    NSLog(@\"%@\", logString);\n\n    // ...or CocoaLumberjackLogger only logging warnings and errors\n    if (logLevel == FLLogLevelError) {\n        DDLogError(@\"%@\", logString);\n    } else if (logLevel == FLLogLevelWarn) {\n        DDLogWarn(@\"%@\", logString);\n    }\n} logLevel:FLLogLevelWarn];\n```\n\nSince FLAnimatedImage is licensed under MIT, it's compatible with the terms of using it for any app on the App Store.\n\n## Release process\n1. Bump version in `FLAnimatedImage.podspec`, update CHANGES, and commit.\n2. Tag commit with `> git tag -a <VERSION> -m \"<VERSION>\"` and `> git push --tags`.\n3. [Submit Podspec to Trunk with](https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/specs-and-specs-repo.html#how-do-i-update-an-existing-pod) `> pod trunk push FLAnimatedImage.podspec` ([ensure you're auth'ed](https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/getting-setup-with-trunk.html#getting-started)).\n## To Do\n- Support other animated image formats such as APNG or WebP (WebP support implemented [here](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage/pull/86))\n- Integration into network libraries and image caches\n- Investigate whether `FLAnimatedImage` should become a `UIImage` subclass\n- Smarter buffering\n- Bring demo app to iPhone\n\nThis code has successfully shipped to many people as is, but please do come with your questions, issues and pull requests!\n\n## Select apps using FLAnimatedImage\n(alphabetically)\n\n- [Close-up](http://closeu.pe)\n- [Design Shots](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id792517951)\n- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)\n- [Dumpert](http://dumpert.nl)\n- [Ello](https://ello.co/)\n- [Facebook](https://facebook.com)\n- [Flipboard](https://flipboard.com)\n- [getGIF](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id964784701)\n- [Gifalicious](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gifalicious-see-your-gifs/id965346708?mt=8)\n- [HashPhotos](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id685784609)\n- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/)\n- [LiveBooth](http://www.liveboothapp.com)\n- [lWlVl Festival](http://lwlvl.com)\n- [Medium](https://medium.com)\n- [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com)\n- [Slack](https://slack.com/)\n- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)\n- [Zip Code Finder](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id893031254)\n\nIf you're using FLAnimatedImage in your app, please open a PR to add it to this list!\n",
