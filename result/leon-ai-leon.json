It is recommended to use the older version under the master branch.\n>\n> Please note that older versions do not make use of any foundation model, which will be introduced in upcoming versions.\n\n**Outdated Documentation**\n\nPlease note that the documentation and this README are not up to date. We've made significant changes to Leon over the past few months, including the introduction of new TTS and ASR engines, and a hybrid approach that balances LLM, simple classification, and multiple NLP techniques to achieve optimal speed, customization, and accuracy. We'll update the documentation for the official release.\n\n**Project History and Future Plans**\n\nSince its inception in 2017, Leon has undergone significant transformations. Although we've been inconsistent in shipping updates over the years, we're now focused on maturing the project. With the recent integration of transformers-based models, we're prepared to unlock Leon's full potential.\n\nOur next step is to finalize the latest features for the official release.\nThen we'll be establishing a group of active contributors to work together, develop new skills, and share them with the community. A skill registry platform will be built (see it as the npm or pip registry but for skills).\n\n- Check out [the roadmap](http://roadmap.getleon.ai/) for more information on our upcoming plans.\n- Watch a [preview of our last progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CInSt6pTVA) to see what we've been working on.\n\n**Get Involved**\n\n[Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/MNQqqKg) to ask questions, or express interest in becoming an active contributor.\n\n---\n\n### Why is there a small amount of contributors?\n\nI'm taking a lot of time to work on the new core of Leon due to personal reasons. I can only work on it during my spare time. Hence, I'm blocking any contribution as the whole core of Leon is coming with many breaking changes. Many of you are willing to contribute in Leon (create new skills, help to improve the core, translations and so on...), a big thanks to every one of you!\n\nWhile I would love to devote more time to Leon, I'm currently unable to do so because I have bills to pay. I have some ideas about how to monetize Leon in the future (Leon's core will always remain open source), but before to get there there is still a long way to go.\n\nUntil then, any financial support by [sponsoring Leon](http://sponsor.getleon.ai) is much appreciated \ud83d\ude42\n\n---\n\n## Latest Release\n\nCheck out the [latest release blog post](https://blog.getleon.ai/binaries-and-typescript-rewrite-1-0-0-beta-8/).\n\n<a href=\"https://blog.getleon.ai/binaries-and-typescript-rewrite-1-0-0-beta-8/\"><img width=\"400\" src=\"https://blog.getleon.ai/static/a0d1cbafd1968e7531dc17e229f8cc61/aa440/beta-8.png\" /></a>\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc4b Introduction\n\n**Leon** is an **open-source personal assistant** who can live **on your server**.\n\nHe **does stuff** when you **ask him to**.\n\nYou can **talk to him** and he can **talk to you**.\nYou can also **text him** and he can also **text you**.\nIf you want to, Leon can communicate with you by being **offline to protect your privacy**.\n\n### Why?\n\n> 1. If you are a developer (or not), you may want to build many things that could help in your daily life.\n>    Instead of building a dedicated project for each of those ideas, Leon can help you with his\n>    Skills structure.\n> 2. With this generic structure, everyone can create their own skills and share them with others.\n>    Therefore there is only one core (to rule them all).\n> 3. Leon uses AI concepts, which is cool.\n> 4. Privacy matters, you can configure Leon to talk with him offline. You can already text with him without any third party services.\n> 5. Open source is great.\n\n### What is this repository for?\n\n> This repository contains the following nodes of Leon:\n>\n> - The server\n> - Skills\n> - The web app\n> - The hotword node\n> - The TCP server (for inter-process communication between Leon and third-party nodes such as spaCy)\n> - The Python bridge (the connector between the core and skills made with Python)\n\n### What is Leon able to do?\n\n> Today, the most interesting part is about his core and the way he can scale up. He is pretty young but can easily scale to have new features (skills).\n> You can find what he is able to do by browsing the [skills list](https://github.com/leon-ai/leon/tree/develop/skills).<br>\n> Please do know that after the official release, we will build many skills along with the community. Feel free to [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/MNQqqKg) to be part of the journey.\n\nSounds good to you?
