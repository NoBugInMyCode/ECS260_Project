This has allowed much better extensibility, leaner and better \n  config files, and a structured, object-oriented codebase with no mandatory\n  third-party dependencies other than a Python interpreter.\n* **Stable and testable code base.** Using Python has allowed unit testing \n  of all the project code. The code is tested to work in Python 3.6+.\n* **Support for prompts and statuslines in many applications.** Originally \n  created exclusively for vim statuslines, the project has evolved to \n  provide statuslines in tmux and several WMs, and prompts for shells like \n  bash/zsh and other applications. It\u2019s simple to write renderers for any \n  other applications that Powerline doesn\u2019t yet support.\n* **Configuration and colorschemes written in JSON.** JSON is \n  a standardized, simple and easy to use file format that allows for easy \n  user configuration across all of Powerline\u2019s supported applications.\n* **Fast and lightweight, with daemon support for even better performance.**\n  Although the code base spans a couple of thousand lines of code with no \n  goal of \u201cless than X lines of code\u201d, the main focus is on good performance \n  and as little code as possible while still providing a rich set of \n  features. The new daemon also ensures that only one Python instance is \n  launched for prompts and statuslines, which provides excellent \n  performance.\n\n*But I hate Python / I don\u2019t need shell prompts / this is just too much \nhassle for me / what happened to the original vim-powerline project / \u2026*\n\nYou should check out some of the Powerline derivatives. The most lightweight\nand feature-rich alternative is currently the `vim-airline \n<https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline>`_ project.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nBasic powerline configuration is done via `JSON` files located at `.config/powerline/`. It is a good idea to start by copying the default configuration located at `powerline_root/powerline/config_files/` to `.config/powerline/`.\nIf you installed the powerline from the AUR or via pip, `powerline_root` should be `/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/` or something similar, depending on your python version.\n\nIf you installed powerline via apt-get 'powerline_root' should be '/usr/share/powerline/'.\n\nThis should yield you the following directory structure:\n\n    ::\n\n        .config/powerline/\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 colorschemes\n        \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 ...\n        \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 wm\n        |\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \u2514\u2500\u2500 default.json  // Your configuration goes here\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 colors.json\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.json\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 themes\n            \u251c\u2500\u2500 ...\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 wm\n                \u2514\u2500\u2500 default.json  // Your configuration goes here\n\n\n\nThe files in the subdirectories of `themes` are used to specify which segments shall be shown; the files in subdirectories of `colorschemes` are used to specify which colors (as defined in `colors.json`) shall be used to display a segment.\n\nNote that your local configuration only overrides the global configuration, it does not replace it, i.e. if you don't configure something locally, the global default will be used instead.\n\n* Consult the `documentation <https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html#quick-setup-guide>`_ for more details. See also the `segment reference <https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration/segments.html>`_ for available segments and their configuration.\n* Check out `powerline-fonts <https://github.com/powerline/fonts>`_ for \n  pre-patched versions of popular, open source coding fonts.\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\nVim statusline\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n**Mode-dependent highlighting**\n\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-mode-normal.png\n     :alt: Normal mode\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-mode-insert.png\n     :alt: Insert mode\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-mode-visual.png\n     :alt: Visual mode\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-mode-replace.png\n     :alt: Replace mode\n\n**Automatic truncation of segments in small windows**\n\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-truncate1.png\n     :alt: Truncation illustration\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-truncate2.png\n     :alt: Truncation illustration\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-truncate3.png\n     :alt: Truncation illustration\n\n----\n\nThe font in the screenshots is `Pragmata Pro`_ by Fabrizio Schiavi.\n\n.. _`Pragmata Pro`: http://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro\n",
