Bootable pre-made images for the Raspberry Pi are available for those that want a ready-to-go system, downloadable from the releases section of GitHub or via our website at https://retropie.org.uk.\n\nThis script is designed for use on Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian) on the Raspberry Pi, OSMC on the Vero4K or Ubuntu on the ODroid-C1 or a PC.\n\nTo run the RetroPie Setup Script make sure that your APT repositories are up-to-date and that Git is installed:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install git\n```\n\nThen you can download the latest RetroPie setup script with:\n\n```shell\ncd\ngit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup.git\n```\n\nThe script is executed with:\n\n```shell\ncd RetroPie-Setup\nsudo ./retropie_setup.sh\n```\n\nWhen you first run the script it may install some additional packages that are needed.\n\nBinaries and Sources\n--------------------\n\nOn the Raspberry Pi, RetroPie Setup offers the possibility to install from binaries or source. For other supported platforms only a source install is available. Installing from binary is recommended on a Raspberry Pi as building everything from source can take a long time.\n\nFor more information, visit the site at https://retropie.org.uk or the repository at https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup.\n\nDocs\n----\n\nYou can find useful information about several components and answers to frequently asked questions in the [RetroPie Docs](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/). If you think that there is something missing, you are invited to submit a pull request to the [RetroPie-Docs repository](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Docs).\n\n\nThanks\n------\n\nThis script just simplifies the usage of the great works of many other people that enjoy the spirit of retrogaming. Many thanks go to them!\n",
