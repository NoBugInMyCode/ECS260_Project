        "readme": "sshuttle: where transparent proxy meets VPN meets ssh\n=====================================================\n\nAs far as I know, sshuttle is the only program that solves the following\ncommon case:\n\n- Your client machine (or router) is Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS or Windows.\n\n- You have access to a remote network via ssh.\n\n- You don't necessarily have admin access on the remote network.\n\n- The remote network has no VPN, or only stupid/complex VPN\n  protocols (IPsec, PPTP, etc). Or maybe you *are* the\n  admin and you just got frustrated with the awful state of\n  VPN tools.\n\n- You don't want to create an ssh port forward for every\n  single host/port on the remote network.\n\n- You hate openssh's port forwarding because it's randomly\n  slow and/or stupid.\n\n- You can't use openssh's PermitTunnel feature because\n  it's disabled by default on openssh servers; plus it does\n  TCP-over-TCP, which has `terrible performance`_.\n\n.. _terrible performance: https://sshuttle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-it-works.html\n\nObtaining sshuttle\n------------------\n\n- Ubuntu 16.04 or later::\n\n      apt-get install sshuttle\n\n- Debian stretch or later::\n\n      apt-get install sshuttle\n\n- Arch Linux::\n\n      pacman -S sshuttle\n\n- Fedora::\n\n      dnf install sshuttle\n\n- openSUSE::\n\n      zypper in sshuttle\n\n- Gentoo::\n\n      emerge -av net-proxy/sshuttle\n\n- NixOS::\n\n      nix-env -iA nixos.sshuttle\n\n- From PyPI::\n\n      sudo pip install sshuttle\n\n- Clone::\n\n      git clone https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle.git\n      cd sshuttle\n      sudo ./setup.py install\n\n- FreeBSD::\n\n      # ports\n      cd /usr/ports/net/py-sshuttle && make install clean\n      # pkg\n      pkg install py39-sshuttle\n\n- OpenBSD::\n\n      pkg_add sshuttle\n\n- macOS, via MacPorts::\n\n      sudo port selfupdate\n      sudo port install sshuttle\n\nIt is also possible to install into a virtualenv as a non-root user.\n\n- From PyPI::\n\n      virtualenv -p python3 /tmp/sshuttle\n      . /tmp/sshuttle/bin/activate\n      pip install sshuttle\n\n- Clone::\n\n      virtualenv -p python3 /tmp/sshuttle\n      . /tmp/sshuttle/bin/activate\n      git clone https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle.git\n      cd sshuttle\n      ./setup.py install\n\n- Homebrew::\n\n      brew install sshuttle\n\n- Nix::\n\n      nix-env -iA nixpkgs.sshuttle\n\n- Windows::\nUse PyPI \n\n      pip install sshuttle\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nThe documentation for the stable version is available at:\nhttps://sshuttle.readthedocs.org/\n\nThe documentation for the latest development version is available at:\nhttps://sshuttle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\n\nRunning as a service\n--------------------\nSshuttle can also be run as a service and configured using a config management system:\nhttps://medium.com/@mike.reider/using-sshuttle-as-a-service-bec2684a65fe\n",
