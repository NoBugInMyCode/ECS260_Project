Dependencies between components are represented in\nWire as function parameters, encouraging explicit initialization instead of\nglobal variables. Because Wire operates without runtime state or reflection,\ncode written to be used with Wire is useful even for hand-written\ninitialization.\n\nFor an overview, see the [introductory blog post][].\n\n[dependency injection]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\n[introductory blog post]: https://blog.golang.org/wire\n[godoc]: https://godoc.org/github.com/google/wire\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.com/google/wire\n\n## Installing\n\nInstall Wire by running:\n\n```shell\ngo install github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire@latest\n```\n\nand ensuring that `$GOPATH/bin` is added to your `$PATH`.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Tutorial][]\n- [User Guide][]\n- [Best Practices][]\n- [FAQ][]\n\n[Tutorial]: ./_tutorial/README.md\n[Best Practices]: ./docs/best-practices.md\n[FAQ]: ./docs/faq.md\n[User Guide]: ./docs/guide.md\n\n## Project status\n\nAs of version v0.3.0, Wire is *beta* and is considered feature complete. It\nworks well for the tasks it was designed to perform, and we prefer to keep it\nas simple as possible.\n\nWe'll not be accepting new features at this time, but will gladly accept bug\nreports and fixes.\n\n## Community\n\nFor questions, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/google/wire/discussions).\n\nThis project is covered by the Go [Code of Conduct][].\n\n[Code of Conduct]: ./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[go-cloud mailing list]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-cloud\n",
