\r\n\r\n```\r\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n- If your Mac is running with an M1, please run the following command next. If not, skip this step. - \r\n\r\n```\r\ncp /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_soundfile_data/libsndfile_arm64.dylib /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_soundfile_data/libsndfile.dylib\r\n```\r\n\r\n**FFmpeg Installation**\r\n\r\n- Once everything is done installing, download the correct FFmpeg binary for your system [here](http://www.osxexperts.net) and place it into the main application directory.\r\n\r\n**Rubber Band Installation**\r\n\r\nIn order to use the Time Stretch or Change Pitch tool, you'll need Rubber Band.\r\n\r\n- Download the precompiled build [here](https://breakfastquay.com/files/releases/rubberband-3.1.2-gpl-executable-windows.zip)\r\n- From the archive, extract the following files to the UVR/lib_v5 application directory:\r\n   - ```rubberband-3.1.2-gpl-executable-macos/rubberband```\r\n\r\nThis process has been tested on a MacBook Pro 2021 (using M1) and a MacBook Air 2017 and is confirmed to be working on both.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Linux Installation (Updated Instructions)\r\n\r\n<details id=\"LinuxInstall\">\r\n  <summary>See Linux Installation Instructions</summary>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n**These installation instructions are for Debian & Arch-based Linux systems.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Step 1: Download the Repository**\r\n- Download and save this repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).\r\n- Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**\r\nUse the following commands based on your system type:\r\n\r\n**For Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.):**\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\r\nsudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg python3-pip python3-tk\r\n```\r\n\r\n**For Arch-based systems (EndeavourOS):**\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pacman -Syu\r\nsudo pacman -S ffmpeg python-pip tk\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**\r\nSetting up a virtual environment (venv) ensures that the program's dependencies do not interfere with system-wide Python packages.\r\n\r\n1. **Navigate to the extracted repository directory:**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   cd /path/to/ultimatevocalremovergui\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Create a virtual environment:**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   python3 -m venv venv\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Activate the virtual environment:**\r\n   - For **Debian-based and Arch-based systems:**\r\n     ```bash\r\n     source venv/bin/activate\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n4. **Install dependencies in the virtual environment:**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Step 4: Run the Application**\r\nWhile the virtual environment is activated, start the application:\r\n```bash\r\npython UVR.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Important Notes**\r\n1. **Avoid Modifying System Files:**  \r\n   Previous instructions suggested deleting the `/usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` file, which is dangerous and can break Python package management. Do **NOT** delete this file.\r\n\r\n2. **Why Use Virtual Environments?**  \r\n   Virtual environments isolate the program's dependencies, preventing conflicts with system Python packages.

Please download the latest version via the following link if you are still experiencing issues - [link](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/releases/tag/v5.6)\r\n\r\nThis issue was being tracked [here](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/issues/840).\r\n\r\n### Issue Reporting\r\n\r\nPlease be as detailed as possible when posting a new issue. \r\n\r\nIf possible, click the \"Settings Button\" to the left of the \"Start Processing\" button and click the \"Error Log\" button for detailed error information that can be provided to us.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe **Ultimate Vocal Remover GUI** code is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE). \r\n\r\n- **Please Note:** For all third-party application developers who wish to use our models, please honor the MIT license by providing credit to UVR and its developers.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n- [ZFTurbo](https://github.com/ZFTurbo) - Created & trained the weights for the new MDX23C models. \r\n- [DilanBoskan](https://github.com/DilanBoskan) - Your contributions at the start of this project were essential to the success of UVR.
