Works in modern versions of Edge, Firefox, Safari and Chrome. IE is [not supported](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api).\n\n## Add Webamp to Your Site\n\nHere is the **most minimal** example of adding Webamp to a page:\n\n```HTML\n<div id=\"app\"></div>\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/webamp\"></script>\n<script>\n    const app = document.getElementById(\"app\")\n    const webamp = new Webamp();\n    webamp.renderWhenReady(app);\n</script>\n```\n\nFor more examples, including how to add audio files, check out [`examples/` directory](./examples) and the [API documentation](./packages/webamp/docs/usage.md).\n\n## About This Repository\n\nWebamp uses a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) approach, so in addition to the Webamp NPM module, this repository contains code for a few closely related projects and some pieces of Webamp which are published as standalone modules:\n\n- [`packages/webamp`](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/tree/master/packages/webamp): The [Webamp NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webamp)\n- [`packages/webamp/demo`](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/tree/master/packages/webamp/demo): The demo site which lives at [webamp.org](https://webamp.org)\n- [`packages/ani-cursor`](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/tree/master/packages/ani-cursor): An NPM module for rendering animiated `.ani` cursors as CSS animations\n- [`packages/skin-database`](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/tree/master/packages/skin-database): The server component of https://skins.webamp.org which also runs our [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/winampskins), and a Discord bot for our community chat\n- [`packages/skin-museum-client`](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/tree/master/packages/skin-museum-client): The front-end component of https://skins.webamp.org.\n- [`packages/winamp-eqf`](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/tree/master/packages/winamp-eqf): An NPM module for parsing and constructing Winamp equalizer preset files (`.eqf`)\n- [`packages/archive-org-webamp-integration-tests`](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/tree/master/packages/archive-org-webamp-integration-tests): An integration that confirms that archive.org's Webamp integration is working as expected\n- [`packages/webamp-modern`](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/tree/master/packages/webamp-modern): A prototype exploring rendering \"modern\" Winamp skins in the browser\n- [`examples`](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/tree/master/examples): A few examples showing how to use the NPM module\n\n## Community\n\nJoin our community chat on Discord: <https://discord.gg/fBTDMqR>\n\nRelated communites:\n\n- [Winamp Community Update Pack] - \"New plug-ins to add additional features to Winamp as well as replacement plug-ins to provide better implementations of some of the plug-ins natively included with Winamp\".
