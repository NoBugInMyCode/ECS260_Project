Equity\ncompensation involves confounding terminology, legal obscurities, and many high-stakes\ndecisions for those who give and receive it.\n\nIf you talk to enough employees and hiring managers, you\u2019ll hear stories of how they or\ntheir colleagues met with the painful consequences of not learning enough up front.\nThough many people learn the basic ideas from personal experience or from colleagues or\nhelpful friends who have been through it before, the intricacies of equity compensation\nare best understood by tax attorneys, corporate lawyers, and other professionals.\n\nDecisions related to [negotiating an offer](#offers-and-negotiations) and\n[exercising stock options](#stock-option-scenarios), in particular, can have **major financial\nconsequences**. Because the value of employee equity is determined by the fate of the\ncompany, an employee\u2019s equity may be [illiquid](#what-is-private-stock-worth) for a long time\nor ultimately [worth nothing](#growth-and-risk), while taxes and the costs of exercise, if\nthey apply, may not be recouped.\nEven when a company is doing well, an employee may suffer\n[catastrophic tax pitfalls](#tax-dangers) because they didn\u2019t anticipate the tax consequences\nof their decisions.\n\nUnderstanding the technicalities of equity compensation does not guarantee that fortune\nwill smile upon you as warmly as it did [the early hires](#history-and-significance) of\nFacebook. But a thorough overview can help you be informed when\n[discussing with professionals](#seeking-professional-advice) for further assistance, make\nbetter decisions for your personal situation, and avoid some [common](#tax-dangers) and\n[costly](#the-amt-trap) mistakes.\n\n### Why This Guide?\n\nThe first edition of this work, written by the same lead authors as the one you\u2019re reading\nnow, received significant feedback and discussion\n[on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10880726),\n[on GitHub](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation), and from individual experts.\nNow, Holloway is pleased to publish this new edition of the Guide.\nWe\u2019ve expanded sections, added resources and visuals, and filled in gaps.\n\nThere is [a lot of information](#further-reading) about equity compensation spread across\nblogs and articles that focus on specific components of the topic, such as vesting, types\nof stock options, or equity levels.\nWe believe there is a need for a consolidated and shared resource, written by and for\npeople on different sides of compensation decisions, including employees, hiring managers,\nfounders, and students.\nAnyone can feel overwhelmed by the complex details and high-stakes personal choices that\nthis topic involves.\nThis reference exists to answer the needs of beginners and the more experienced.\n\nHolloway and our contributors are motivated by a single purpose:\nTo help readers understand important details and their contexts well enough to make better\ndecisions themselves.\nThe Guide aims to be **practical** (with concrete suggestions and pitfalls to avoid),\n**thoughtful** (with context and multiple expert perspectives, including divergent opinion on\ncontroversial topics), and **concise** (it is dense but contains only notable details\u2014still,\nit\u2019s at least a three-hour read, with links to three hundred sources!).\n\nThe Guide does not purport to be either perfect or complete.\nA reference like this is always in process.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re currently testing features to enable the Holloway community to suggest\nimprovements, contribute new sections, and call out anything that needs revision.\nWe welcome (and will gladly credit) [your help](#please-help).\n\nWe especially wish to [recognize](#credits) the dozens of people who have helped write,\nreview, edit, and improve it so far\u2014and in the future\u2014and hope you\u2019ll check back often as\nit improves.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis Guide **currently covers**:\n\n- Equity compensation in **C corporations** in the **United States**.\n- Equity compensation for most employees, advisors, and independent contractors in private\n  companies, from startups through larger private corporations.\n- Limited coverage of equity compensation in public companies.\n\nTopics **not yet covered**:\n\n- Equity compensation programs, such as [ESPPs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/espp.asp)\n  in public companies.\n  (We\u2019d like to [see this improve](#please-help) in the future.)\n- Full details on executive equity compensation.\n- Compensation outside the United States.\n- Compensation in companies other than C corporations, including\n  [LLCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company) and\n  [S corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_corporation), where equity compensation is\n  approached and practiced in very different ways.\n\nFor these situations, see [other resources](#when-to-turn-elsewhere) and get\n[professional advice](#seeking-professional-advice).\n\n### Who May Find This Useful\n\nOur aim is to be as helpful to the beginner as to those with more experience.\nHaving talked with employees, CEOs, investors, and lawyers, we can assure you that no\nmatter how much you know about equity compensation, you will likely run into confusion at\nsome point.\n\nIf you\u2019re an **employee** or a **candidate for a job**, some of these may apply to you:\n\n- You\u2019ve heard phrases like *stock*, *stock options*, *strike price*, *ISOs*, *RSUs*, *83(b)\n  election*, *409A valuation*, *AMT*, or *early exercise* and know they are probably\n  important but are mystified by what some of them really mean or whether they apply to your\n  situation.\n- You\u2019re considering a job offer but don\u2019t know how to\n  [navigate or negotiate](#offers-and-negotiations) the equity component of the offer.\n- You\u2019re joining a startup for the first time and are overwhelmed by all the\n  [paperwork](#documents-and-agreements).\n- You\u2019re quitting, taking a leave of absence, or are being laid off or fired from a company\n  where you have stock or options and are thinking through the decisions and consequences.\n- A company you work for is going through an acquisition, IPO, or shutdown.\n- You have stock in a private company and [need cash](#stock-option-scenarios).\n\n**Founders** or **hiring managers** who need to talk about equity compensation with employees\nor potential hires will also find this Guide useful.\nAs many entrepreneurs and hiring managers will tell you, this topic isn\u2019t easy on that\nside of the table, either!\nNegotiating with candidates and fielding questions from candidates and employees requires\nunderstanding the same complex technicalities of equity compensation well.\n\nThat said, this topic is **not simple** and we ask that readers be willing to invest time to\nget through a lot of confusing detail.\nIf you\u2019re in a hurry, or you don\u2019t care to learn the details, this Guide may not be for\nyou. [Seek advice](#seeking-professional-advice).\n\n### A Note on Fairness\n\nMuch of what you read about equity compensation was written by a single person, from a\nsingle vantage point.\nThe authors and editors of this Guide have navigated the territory of equity compensation\nfrom the perspective of employees, hiring managers, founders, and lawyers.\nWe do believe that the knowledge here,\n[combined with professional advice](#seeking-professional-advice), can make a significant\ndifference for **both employees and hiring managers**.\n\nOne of the difficulties for candidates negotiating equity compensation is that they may\nhave less information about what they are worth than the person hiring them.\nCompanies talk to many candidates and often have access to or pay for expensive\nmarket-rate compensation data.\nWhile some data on [typical equity levels](#typical-employee-equity-levels) have been\npublished online, much of it fails to represent the value of a candidate with their own\nspecific experience in a specific role.\nHowever, even without exact data, candidates and hiring managers can develop better mental\nframeworks to think about [offers and negotiations](#offers-and-negotiations).\n\nOn the other hand, challenges are not limited to those of employees.\nFounders and hiring managers also often struggle with talking through the web of\ntechnicalities with potential hires, and can make equally poor decisions when making\noffers. Either over-compensating or under-compensating employees can have unfortunate\nconsequences.\n\nIn short, both companies and employees are routinely hurt by uninformed decisions and\ncostly mistakes when it comes to equity compensation.\nA shared resource is helpful for both sides.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n### The Holloway Reader\n\nThe Holloway Reader you\u2019re using now is designed to help you find and navigate the\nmaterial you need. **Use the search box.**\nIt will reveal definitions, section-by-section results, and content contained in **the\nhundreds of resources we\u2019ve linked to** throughout the Guide.\nThink of it as a mini library of the best content on equity compensation.\nWe also provide mouseover (or short tap on mobile) for **definitions of terms**, related\nsection suggestions, and external links while you read.\n\n### How This Guide Is Organized\n\nThis Guide contains a lot of material.\nAnd it\u2019s dense.\nSome readers may wish to read front to back, but you can also **search or navigate directly**\nto parts that are of interest to you, **referring back** to foundational topics as needed.\n\nEquity compensation lies at the intersection of corporate law, taxation, and employee\ncompensation, and so requires some basic understanding of all three.\nYou might think compensation and taxation are separate topics, but they are so intertwined\nit would be misleading to explain one without the other.\nWe cover material in logical order, so that if you do read the earlier sections first,\nlater sections on the interactions of tax and compensation will be clearer.\n\nWe start with [**Equity Compensation Basics**](#equity-compensation-basics): What compensation\nand equity are, and why equity is used as compensation.\n\nBut before we get much further, we need to talk about what stock is, and how companies are\nformed. [**Fundamentals of Stock Corporations**](#fundamentals-of-stock-corporations) covers how\ncompanies organize their ownership, how stock is issued, public companies and private\ncompanies, and IPOs and liquidity (which determine when equity is worth cash).\n\nWhile not everyone reading this works at an early stage company, those who do can benefit\nfrom understanding the role of equity in [**Startups and Growth**](#startups-and-growth). This is\ngood context for anyone involved in a private company that has taken on venture capital.\n\n[**How Equity is Granted**](#how-equity-is-granted) is the core of this Guide.\nWe describe the forms in which equity is most commonly granted, including restricted stock\ngrants, stock options, and RSUs.\n\nNow is where it gets messier\u2014taxes:\n\n- [**Tax Basics**](#tax-basics): A technical summary of how taxation works.\n  Many of the headaches of equity compensation involve how it is taxed, including ordinary\n  income tax, long-term capital gains tax, and the lesser-known but sometimes critical\n  alternative minimum tax.\n- [**Taxes on Equity Compensation**](#taxes-on-equity-compensation): How much tax you owe is greatly\n  affected by the kind of equity you have (such as restricted stock awards, stock options,\n  or RSUs), when you choose to pay (including 83(b) elections), and when you choose to\n  exercise options.\n\nAfter these technical concerns, we move on to how you can think about all this in\npractice. These sections focus on scenarios common to employees and candidates, but are\nalso of likely interest to founders and hiring managers:\n\n- [**Plans and Scenarios**](#plans-and-scenarios): Whether you have equity now or will in the\n  future, it is helpful to learn *how to think about* the value of equity and its tax\n  burden. We also cover whether you can [sell private stock](#can-you-sell-private-stock).\n- [**Offers and Negotiations**](#offers-and-negotiations): Equity often comes up as you\u2019re\n  negotiating or debating whether to accept a job offer.\n  Here we cover what to expect, what to ask, tips and pitfalls, and more.\n\nFinally, we offer some additional resources:\n\n- [**Documents and Agreements**](#documents-and-agreements): A bit more detail on the actual legal\n  paperwork you\u2019re likely to see as you negotiate and after you\u2019ve accepted an offer.\n- [**Further Reading**](#further-reading): A curated list of what else you can read on the subject,\n  including many papers, books, and articles that have informed this Guide.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 What about a Getting Help section outlining when to go to whom for professional help?\n\n### When to Turn Elsewhere\n\n**CEOs**, **CFOs**, **COOs**, or anyone who runs a company or team of significant size should be\nsure to talk to an equity compensation consultant or a specialist at a law firm to learn\nabout equity compensation plans.\n\n**Founders** looking for an introduction to the legalities of running a company may wish to\ncheck out [*Legal Concepts for Founders*](https://handbook.clerky.com/), from Clerky, in\naddition to talking to a lawyer.\nFounders should also lean on their investors for advice, as they may have additional\nexperience.\n\n**Executive compensation** at large or public companies is an even more nuanced topic, on\nboth sides of the table.\nHire an experienced lawyer or compensation consultant.\nThere are extensive legal [resources](https://www.compensationstandards.com/home/) available\non executive compensation.\n\n### Seeking Professional Advice\n\nThis Guide does not replace professional advice.\n\nPlease read the full [disclaimer](#disclaimer) and seek professional advice from a lawyer,\ntax professional, or other compensation expert before making significant decisions.\n\nDoes that make reading through these details a waste of time?\nNot at all. Important decisions rarely should or can be blindly delegated.\nThis Guide *complements but does not replace* the advice you get from professionals.\nWorking with the support of a professional can help you make better decisions when you\nhave an understanding of the topic yourself and know what questions to ask.\n\n## Equity Compensation Basics\n\n### History and Significance\n\nCompanies ranging from two-person startups to the\n[Fortune 500](http://fortune.com/fortune500/) have found that granting partial ownership in a\ncompany is among the best methods to attract and retain exceptional talent.\nIn the United States, partial ownership through [stock options](#stock-options) has been a\nkey part of pay for executives and other employees since the 1950s.[^corpgovlaw.6vw7qt]\nAs recently as 2014, **7.2%** of all private sector employees (**8.5 million** people) and\n**13.1%** of *all* employees of companies with stock held stock options, according to the\nNational Center for Employee Ownership.[^nceoorgass.x6588n]\nMany believe employee ownership has\n[\ud83d\udcb0fostered innovations](https://www.wsj.com/articles/reviving-the-flagging-spirit-of-silicon-valley-1428706671)\nin technology, especially in Silicon Valley, from the\n[early days](http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/publications/measure/pdf/1976_07.pdf)\nof Hewlett-Packard to recent examples like Facebook.\nStock options helped the first 3,000 employees of Facebook enjoy roughly **$23 billion** at\nthe time the company went public.[^ftcomconte.x613np]\n\n\ud83c\udf2a Some controversy surrounds the use of equity compensation for high-paid executives.\nPublic companies offer executives equity compensation in no small part because of a tax\nloophole. In 1993, President Bill Clinton attempted to limit executive pay with a new\nsection[^treasurygo.tbpcyx] of the Internal Revenue Code.\nUnfortunately, the legislation backfired;\na loophole made performance-based pay\u2014including stock options\u2014fully tax deductible,\nthereby creating a dramatic incentive to pay executives through stock options.[^epiorgpubl.cq5o0o]\nFrom 1970\u201379, the average compensation for a CEO of one of the 50 largest firms in the\nUnited States was **$1.2M**, of which **11.2%** was from stock options.\nBy 2000\u201305, the same numbers had risen to **$9.2M** and **37%**, respectively.[^nberorgpap.wtsymr]\n\n### Growth and Risk\n\nGenerally, equity compensation is closely linked to the **growth** of a company.\nCash-poor startups persuade early employees to take pay cuts and join their team by\noffering meaningful [ownerships stakes](#typical-employee-equity-levels), catering to hopes\nthat the company will one day grow large enough to [go public](#ipos) or\n[be sold](#sales-and-liquidity) for an ample sum.\nMore mature but still fast-growing companies find offering compensation linked to\nownership is more attractive than high cash compensation to many candidates.\n\nWith the hope for growth, however, also comes **risk**. Large, fast-growing companies often\nhit hard times.\nAnd [startups](#startups-and-growth) routinely fail or yield no returns for investors or\nworkers. According to [a report](http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/startup-advice-data-failure/)\nby Cambridge Associates and Fortune Magazine, between 1990 and 2010, **about 60%** of\nventure capital-backed companies returned less than the original investment, leaving\nemployees with the painful realization that their startup was not, in fact, the next\nGoogle. Of the remaining **40%**, just a select few go on to make a many of their employees\nwealthy, as has been the case with iconic high-growth companies, like Starbucks,[^investoped.aaps6n] UPS,[^moneycnnco.80o8bh]\nAmazon,[^techcrunch.9ucopn] Google,[^dealbookny.es6h1j] or Facebook.[^enwikipedi.q7bc95]\n\n### Compensation and Equity\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Compensation** is any remuneration to a person (including employees, contractors,\nadvisors, founders, and board members) for services performed or rendered to a company.\nCompensation comes in the forms of cash pay (salary and any bonuses) and any non-cash pay,\nincluding [benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_benefits#United_States) like\nhealth insurance, family-related protections, perks, and retirement plans.\n\nCompany strategies for compensation are\n[far from simple](http://firstround.com/review/counterintuitive-comp-tips-for-the-unwary-and-uninitiated/).\nBeth Scheer, head of talent at the venture fund Homebrew, offers a\n[thoughtful overview](https://quip.com/HEB3Ah9dYD6o) of compensation in startups.\n\nAnother term you may encounter is\n[*total rewards*](https://www.worldatwork.org/total-rewards-model/), which refers to a model of\nattracting and retaining employees using a combination of salary and incentive\ncompensation (like equity), benefits, recognition for contribution or commitment (like\nawards and bonuses), training programs, and initiatives to improve the work environment.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 In the context of compensation and investment, **equity** broadly refers to any kind of\nownership in a company that can be held by individuals (like employees or board members)\nand by other businesses (like venture capital firms).\nOne common kind of equity is stock, but equity can take other forms, such as stock options\nor warrants, that give ownership rights.\nCommonly, equity also comes with certain conditions, such as vesting or repurchase rights.\nNote the term *equity* also has\n[several other](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) technical meanings in\naccounting and real estate.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 [**Equity compensation**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity-compensation.asp) is the\npractice of granting equity in exchange for work.\n\nIn this Guide we focus on equity compensation in stock corporations, the kind of company\nwhere ownership is represented by stock.\n(We describe stock in more detail in [the next section](#fundamentals-of-stock-corporations).)\nEquity compensation in the form of a direct grant of stock with no strings attached is\nvery rare. Instead, employees are given stock with additional restrictions placed on it,\nor are given contractual rights that later can lead to owning stock.\nThese forms of equity compensation include restricted stock, stock options, and restricted\nstock units, each of which we\u2019ll [describe in detail](#how-equity-is-granted).\n\n### The Goals of Equity Compensation\n\nThe purpose of equity compensation is threefold:\n\n- **Attract and retain talent.**\n  When a company already has or can be predicted to have significant financial success,\n  talented people are [incentivized](https://avc.com/2010/10/employee-equity-options/) to work\n  for the company by the prospect of their equity being\n  [worth a lot](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253438) of money in the future.\n  The actual probability of life-changing lucre may be low (or at least, lower than you may\n  think if your entire knowledge of startups is watching \u201c[The Social Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network)\u201d).\n  But even a small chance at winning big can be worth the risk to many people, and to some\n  the risk itself can be exciting.\n- **Align incentives.**\n  Even companies that can afford to pay lots of cash may prefer to give employees equity,\n  so that employees work to increase the *future* value of the company.\n  In this way, equity aligns individuals\u2019 incentives with the interests of the company.\n  At its best, this philosophy fosters an environment of teamwork and a \u201crising tides lift\n  all boats\u201d mentality.\n  It also encourages everyone involved to think\n  [long-term](https://www.cebglobal.com/blogs/equity-compensation-will-stop-short-termism-and-boost-growth/),\n  which is key for company success.\n  As we\u2019ll [discuss later](#offers-and-negotiations), the amount of equity you\u2019re offered\n  usually reflects both your contribution to the company and your commitment to the company\n  in the future.\n- **Reduce cash spending.**\n  By giving equity, a company can often pay less in cash compensation to employees now,\n  with the hope of rewarding them later, and put that money toward other investments or\n  operating expenses.\n  This can be essential in the early stages of a company or at other times where there may\n  not be enough revenue to pay large salaries.\n  Equity compensation can also help recruit senior employees or executives who would\n  otherwise command especially high salaries.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Mention or link to lockup periods etc.\n\n## Fundamentals of Stock Corporations\n\nIn this section, we describe the basics of how stock and shares are used.\n\nThose familiar with stock, stock corporations, public companies, and private companies can\n[jump ahead](#how-equity-is-granted) to how those companies grant equity.\n\n### Kinds of Companies\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A **company** is a legal entity formed under corporate law for the purpose of conducting\ntrade. In the United States, specific rules and regulations govern several kinds of\n[business entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_business_entity#United_States).\nFederal and state law have significant implications on liability and taxation for each\nkind of company.\nNotable types of companies include sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability\ncompanies (LLCs), S corporations, and C corporations.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A **corporation** is a company that is legally recognized as a single entity.\nThe corporation itself, and not its owners, is obligated to repay debts and accountable\nunder contracts and legal actions (that is, is a \u201c[legal person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)\u201d).\nMost commonly, the term *corporation* is used to refer to a\n**[stock corporation (or joint-stock company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint-stock_company)**,\nwhich is a corporation where ownership is managed using stock. **Non-stock corporations**\nthat do not issue stock exist as well, the most common being\n[nonprofit organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization). (A few\n[less common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-stock_corporation) for-profit non-stock\ncorporations also exist.)\n\nIn practice, people often use the word *company* to mean *corporation*.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Incorporation** is the\n[legal process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)) of forming (or\n**incorporating**) a new corporation, such as a business or nonprofit.\nCorporations can be created in any country.\nIn the United States, incorporation is handled by state law, and involves filing\n[articles of incorporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_incorporation) and a\nvariety of other [required information](https://handbook.clerky.com/formation/process) with\nthe Secretary of State.\n(Note that the formation of companies that are not corporations, such as partnerships or\nLLCs, is not the same as incorporation.)\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A [**C corporation (or C corp)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_corporation) is a type of\nstock corporation in the United States with certain federal\n[tax treatment](https://ct.wolterskluwer.com/resource-center/articles/what-c-corporation). It\nis the most prevalent kind of corporation.[^investoped.m9wdqp]\nMost large, well-known American companies are C corporations.\nC corporations differ from\n[S corporations](https://www.incorporate.com/starting-a-business/s-corporation) and other\nbusiness entities in several ways, including how income is taxed and who may own stock.\nC corporations have no limit on the number of shareholders allowed to own part of the\ncompany. They also allow other corporations, as well as partnerships, trusts, and other\nbusinesses, to own stock.\n\nC corps are overwhelmingly popular for early-stage\n[private companies](#public-and-private-companies) looking to sell part of their business in\nexchange for investment from individuals and organizations like venture capital firms\n(which are often partnerships), and for established public companies selling large numbers\nof stock to individuals and other companies on the\n[public exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange).\n\nIn practice, for a few reasons, these companies are usually formed in Delaware, so\nlegalities of all this are defined in Delaware law.[^quoracomwh.wsnr2b][^nytimescom.67ksyb]\nYou can think of Delaware law as the primary \u201clanguage\u201d of U.S. corporate law.\nIncorporating a company in Delaware has evolved into a national standard for high-growth\ncompanies, regardless of where they are physically located.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 This Guide focuses specifically on C corporations and [does not cover](#scope) how equity\ncompensation works in LLCs, S corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships.\nBoth equity and compensation are handled in significantly different ways in each of these\nkinds of businesses.\n\nLoosely, one way to think about companies is that they are simply a set of\n[contracts](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/contract), negotiated over time between the people\nwho own and operate the company, and which are enforced by the government, that aligns the\ninterests of everyone involved in creating things customers are willing to pay for.\nKey to these contracts is a way to precisely track ownership of the company;\nissuing stock is how companies often choose to do this.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Mention how court cases are settled?\n\n### Stock and Shares\n\n\ud83c\udd33 [**Stock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock) is a legal invention that represents\nownership in a company. [**Shares**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_(finance)) are portions\nof stock that allow a company to grant ownership to a variety of people or other companies\nin flexible ways.\nEach **shareholder (or stockholder)**, as these owners are called, holds a specific number\nof shares. Founders, investors, employees, board members, contractors, advisors, and other\ncompanies, like law firms, can all be shareholders.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Stock ownership is often formalized on **stock certificates**, which are fancy pieces of\npaper that prove who owns the stock.\n\nSometimes you have stock but don\u2019t have the physical certificate, as it may be held for\nyou at a law office.\n\nSome companies now manage their ownership through online services called *ownership\nmanagement platforms*, such as [Carta](https://carta.com/). If the company you work for uses\nan ownership management platform, you will be able to view your stock certificates and\nstock values online.\n\nYounger companies may also choose to keep their stock *uncertificated*, which means your\nsole evidence of ownership is your contracts with the company, and your spot on the\ncompany\u2019s cap table, without having a separate certificate for it.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 [**Outstanding shares**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) refer to\nthe total number of shares held by all shareholders.\nThis number starts at an essentially arbitrary value (such as 10 million) when the company\nis created, and thereafter will increase as new shares are added (issued) and granted to\npeople in exchange for money or services.\n\nOutstanding shares may increase or decrease for other reasons too, such as\n[stock splits and share buybacks](http://www.investorguide.com/article/11713/splits-and-buybacks-explained/),\nwhich we won\u2019t get into here.\n\nLater, we discuss several [subtleties](#counting-shares) in how shares are counted.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 What is a good overview on stock splits and share buyback.\nKey resources?\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Any shareholder has a **percentage ownership** in the company, determined by dividing the\nnumber of shares they own by the number of outstanding shares.\nAlthough stock paperwork will always list numbers of shares, if share value is uncertain,\npercentage ownership is often a more meaningful number, particularly if you know or can\nestimate a likely valuation of the company.\nEven if the number of shares a person has is fixed, their percentage ownership will change\nover time as the outstanding shares change.\nTypically, this number is presented in percent or\n[**basis points**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp) (hundredths of a percent).\n\n### Public and Private Companies\n\n\ud83c\udd33 [**Public companies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company) are corporations in which\nany member of the public can own stock.\nPeople can buy and sell the stock for cash on public\n[stock exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp). The value of a company\u2019s\nshares is the value displayed in the stock market reports, so shareholders know how much\ntheir stock is worth.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Most smaller companies, including all startups, are\n[**private companies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company) with owners who\ncontrol how those companies operate.\nUnlike a public company, where anyone is able to buy and sell stock, owners of a private\ncompany control who is able to buy and sell stock.\nThere may be few or no transactions, or they may not be publicly known.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 What are public exchanges and how is stock bought and sold in practice?\nMention accredited investors?\n\n### Governance\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A corporation has a **board of directors**, a\n[group of people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors) whose legal obligation is\nto oversee the company and ensure it serves the best interests of the shareholders.\nPublic companies are legally obligated to have a board of directors, while private\ncompanies often elect to have one.\nThe board typically consists of **inside directors**, such as the CEO, one or two founders,\nor executives employed by the company, and **outside directors**, who are not involved in\nthe day-to-day workings of the company.\nThese **board members** are elected individuals who have legal, corporate governance rights\nand duties when it comes to voting on key company decisions.\nA board member is said to have a **board seat** at the company.\n\nBoards of directors range from 3 to 31 members, with an average size of 9.[^investoped.fn52lq] Boards are\nalmost always an odd number in order to avoid tie votes.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the state of California requires public companies to have at least\none woman on their boards.[^nytimescom.gec7iw]\n\nKey decisions of the board are made formally in *board meetings* or in writing (called\n*written consent*).[^dlapiperac.wb4617] Many decisions around granting equity to employees are approved by the\nboard of directors.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 This section could be expanded, and also include more legal links.\n\n### IPOs\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A private company becomes a public company in a process called an\n[**initial public offering (IPO)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering).\nHistorically, only private companies with a strong track record of years of growth have\nconsidered themselves ready to take this significant step.\nThe IPO has [pros and cons](https://www.investopedia.com/university/ipo/ipo.asp) that include\nexchanging a host of high regulatory costs for the benefits of significant capital.\nAfter a company \u201cIPOs\u201d or \u201c**goes public**,\" investors and the general public can buy stock,\nand existing shareholders can sell their stock far more easily than when the company was\nprivate.\n\nCompanies take years to IPO after being formed.\nThe median time between a company\u2019s founding and its IPO has been increasing.\nAccording to a Harvard report, companies that went public in **2016** took **7.7 years** to do\nso, compared to **3.1 years** for companies that went public in **1996**.[^corpgovlaw.vbw82s]\n\n\ud83d\udea7 What are the restrictions and regulations on selling stock that affect employees at\nIPO? What is a lockup period?\n\n### Sales and Liquidity\n\n\u2757\ufe0f With private companies, it can be very [hard to know](#what-is-private-stock-worth) the\nvalue of equity.\nBecause the value of private company stock is not determined by regular trades on public\nmarkets, shareholders can only make educated guesses about the likely future value, at a\ntime when they will be able to sell stock.\n\nAfter all, private company stock is simply a legal agreement that entitles you to\nsomething of highly uncertain value, and could well be worthless in the future, or highly\nvaluable, depending on the fate of the company.\n\n\u261d\ufe0f We\u2019ll discuss the notion of a company officially assigning a\n[fair market value](#409a-valuations) later, but even if a company gives you a value for your\nstock for tax and accounting purposes, it doesn\u2019t mean you can expect to sell it for that\nvalue!\n\n\ud83c\udd33 An [**acquisition**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp) is the purchase of\nmore than 50% of the shares of one company (the acquired company) by another company (the\npurchaser). This is also called a **sale** of the acquired company.\nIn an acquisition, the acquired company cedes control to the purchaser.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 The ability to buy and sell stock is called **liquidity**. In startups and many private\ncompanies, it is often hard to sell stock until the company is sold or goes public, so\nthere is little or no liquidity for shareholders until those events occur.\nThus, sales and IPOs are called both **exits** and **liquidity events**. Sales, dissolutions,\nand bankruptcy are all called **liquidations**.\n\nOften people wish they could sell stock in a private company, because they would prefer\nhaving the cash.\nThis is only possible occasionally.\nWe get into the details [later](#can-you-sell-private-stock), in our section on selling\nprivate stock.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A [**dividend**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) is a distribution of a\ncompany\u2019s profit to shareholders, authorized by the board of directors.\nEstablished public companies and some private companies pay dividends, but this is rare\namong startups and companies focused on rapid growth, since they often wish to re-invest\ntheir profits into expanding the business, rather than paying that money back to\nshareholders. Amazon, for example, has\n[never paid](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/28/will-amazon-start-paying-a-dividend-in-2018.aspx)\ndividends.\n\n## Startups and Growth\n\nIf you\u2019re considering working for a startup, what we cover next on how these early-stage\ncompanies raise money and grow is helpful in understanding what your equity may be worth.\n\nIf you\u2019re only concerned with large and established companies, you can skip ahead to\n[how equity is granted](#how-equity-is-granted).\n\n### Startups\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A [**startup**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company) is an emerging company,\ntypically a private company, that aspires to grow quickly in size, revenue, and influence.\nOnce a company is established in the market and successful for a while, it usually stops\nbeing called a startup.\n\n\u261d\ufe0f Unlike the terminology around corporations, which has legal significance, the term\n*startup* is informal, and not everyone uses it consistently.\n\nStartups are not the same as small businesses.\nSmall businesses, like a coffee shop or plumbing business, typically intend to grow slowly\nand organically, while relying much less on investment capital and equity compensation.\nDistinguished startup investor\n[Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) has\n[emphasized](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html) that it\u2019s best to think of a startup as\nany [early stage](#stages-of-a-startup) company intending to grow quickly.\n\n\u2211 C corporations dominate the startup ecosystem.\nLLCs tend to be better suited for slower-growth companies that intend to distribute\nprofits instead of re-investing them for growth.\nBecause of this, and for complex reasons related to how their capital is raised, venture\ncapitalists significantly prefer to invest in C corporations.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 What are good stats on how many people work in startups vs.\nestablished companies?\n\n### Fundraising, Growth, and Dilution\n\nMany large and successful companies began as startups.\nIn general, startups rely on investors to help fund rapid growth.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Fundraising** is the process of seeking capital to build or scale a business.\nSelling shares in a business to investors is one form of fundraising, as are loans and\n[initial coin offerings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering). **Financing**\nrefers both to fundraising from outside sources and to bringing in revenue from selling a\nproduct or service.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Venture capital** is a form of financing for early-stage companies that individual\ninvestors or investment firms provide in exchange for partial ownership, or equity, in a\ncompany. These investors are called **venture capitalists (or VCs)**. Venture capitalists\ninvest in companies they perceive to be capable of growing quickly and commanding\nsignificant market share.\n\u201cVenture\u201d refers to the risky nature of investing in early-stage businesses\u2014typically\nstartups\u2014with unproven business models.\n\nA startup goes through several [stages of growth](#stages-of-a-startup) as it raises capital\nbased on the hope and expectation that the company will grow and make more money in the\nfuture.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Companies add (or \u201cissue\u201d) shares during fundraising, which can be exchanged for cash\nfrom investors.\nAs the number of outstanding shares goes up, the percentage ownership of each shareholder\ngoes down. This is called [**dilution**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp).\n\n\u261d\ufe0f Dilution doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re losing anything as a shareholder.\nAs a company issues stock and raises money, the smaller percentage of the company you *do*\nhave could be worth more.\nThe size of your slice gets relatively smaller, but, if the company is growing, the size\nof the cake gets bigger.\nFor example, a typical startup might have three rounds of funding, with each round of\nfunding issuing 20% more shares.\nAt the end of the three rounds, there are more outstanding shares\u2014roughly 73% more in this\ncase, since 120%\u00d7120%\u00d7120% is 173%\u2014and each shareholder owns proportionally less of the\ncompany.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 The [**valuation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)) of the company is the\npresent value investors believe the company has.\nIf the company is doing well, growing revenue or showing indications of future revenue\n(like a growing number of users or traction in a promising market), the company\u2019s\nvaluation will usually be on the rise.\nThat is, the [price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price) for an investor to buy one\nshare of the company would be increasing.\n\n\u2757\ufe0f Of course, things do not always go well, and the valuation of a company does not always\ngo up. It can happen that a company fails entirely and all ownership stakes become\nworthless, or that the valuation is lower than expected and\n[certain kinds](#classes-of-stock) of shares become worthless while other kinds have some\nvalue. When investors and leadership in a company expect the company to do better than it\nactually does, it can have a lot of disappointing consequences for shareholders.\n\n### Dilution Illustrations\n\nThese visualizations illustrate how ownership of a venture-backed company evolves as\nfunding is raised.\nOne scenario imagines changes to ownership in a well-performing startup, and the other is\nloosely based on a careful analysis of Zipcar,[^reactionwh.uw835n] a ride-sharing company that experienced\nsubstantial dilution before eventually going public and being\n[acquired](#sales-and-liquidity). These diagrams simplify complexities such as the ones\ndiscussed in that analysis, but they give a sense of how ownership can be diluted.\n\n```hlwy-infographics\n{\n  \"name\": \"CaptableDilution\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"hypothetical\": {\n      \"label\": \"Hypothetical\",\n      \"stages\": [\n        {\n          \"label\": \"Founding\",\n          \"postValuation\": 1000,\n          \"captable\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"founder1\",\n              \"label\": \"Founder #1\",\n              \"shares\": 4000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"founder2\",\n              \"label\": \"Founder #2\",\n              \"shares\": 3000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"founder3\",\n              \"label\": \"Founder #3\",\n              \"shares\": 3000000\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"label\": \"Series A\",\n          \"captable\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"founder1\",\n              \"label\": \"Founder #1\",\n              \"shares\": 4000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"founder2\",\n              \"label\": \"Founder #2\",\n              \"shares\": 3000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"founder3\",\n              \"label\": \"Founder #3\",\n              \"shares\": 3000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"options\",\n              \"label\": \"Options Pool\",\n              \"shares\": 1500000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"investment\",\n              \"label\": \"Seed\",\n              \"preValuation\": 8000000,\n              \"raised\": 2000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"investment\",\n              \"label\": \"Series A\",\n              \"preValuation\": 8000000,\n              \"raised\": 5000000\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"label\": \"Series C\",\n          \"captable\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"founder1\",\n              \"label\": \"Founder #1\",\n              \"shares\": 4000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"founder2\",\n              \"label\": \"Founder #2\",\n              \"shares\": 3000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"founder3\",\n              \"label\": \"Founder #3\",\n              \"shares\": 3000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"options\",\n              \"label\": \"Options Pool\",\n              \"shares\": 1500000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"investment\",\n              \"label\": \"Seed\",\n              \"preValuation\": 8000000,\n              \"raised\": 2000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"investment\",\n              \"label\": \"Series A\",\n              \"preValuation\": 8000000,\n              \"raised\": 5000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"investment\",\n              \"label\": \"Series B\",\n              \"preValuation\": 20000000,\n              \"raised\": 10000000\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"investment\",\n              \"label\": \"Series C\",\n              \"preValuation\": 40000000,\n              \"raised\": 20000000\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"zipcar\": {\n      \"label\": \"Approx.

The\noption pool is part of a legal structure called an equity incentive plan.\nA typical size for the option pool is 20% of the stock of the company, but, especially for\nearlier stage companies, the option pool can be 10%, 15%, or other sizes.\n\nOnce the pool is established, the company\u2019s board of directors grants stock from the pool\nto employees as they join the company.\n\n\u2211 Well-advised companies will reserve in the option pool only what they\n[expect to use](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/05/01/option-pool-not-ocean-startups/) over\nthe next 12 months or so;\notherwise, given how equity grants are usually promised, they may be over-granting equity.\nThe whole pool may never be fully used, but companies should still try not to reserve more\nthan they plan to use.\nThe size of the pool is determined by\n[complex factors](http://venturehacks.com/articles/option-pool-shuffle) between founders and\ninvestors. It\u2019s worth employees (and\n[founders](https://www.cooleygo.com/negotiating-option-pool/)) understanding that a small pool\ncan be a good thing in that it reflects the company preserving ownership in negotiations\nwith investors.\nThe size of the pool may be increased later.\n\n### Counting Shares\n\nThere are some key subtleties you\u2019re likely to come across in the way\n[outstanding shares](#stock-and-shares) are counted:\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Private companies always have what are referred to as **authorized but unissued** shares,\nreferring to shares that are authorized in legal paperwork but have not actually been\nissued. Until they are issued, the\n[unissued stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unissuedstock.asp) these shares\nrepresent doesn\u2019t mean anything to the company or to shareholders:\nno one owns it.\n\n\u261d\ufe0f For example, a corporation might have 100 million *authorized* shares, but will only\nhave *issued* 10 million shares.\nIn this example, the corporation would have 90 million *authorized but unissued* shares.\nWhen you are trying to determine what percentage a number of shares represents, you do\n*not* make reference to the authorized but unissued shares.\n\n\u261d\ufe0f You actually want to know the total issued shares, but even this number can be\nconfusing, as it can be computed\n[more than one way](http://www.mattbartus.com/option-grants-fully-diluted-or-issued-and-outstanding/).\nTypically, people count shares in two ways: *issued and outstanding* and *fully diluted*.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Issued and outstanding** refers to the number of shares actually issued by a company to\nshareholders, and does not include shares that others may have an option to purchase.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Fully diluted** refers to all of the shares that a company has issued, all of the\nshares that have been set aside in a stock incentive plan, and all of the shares that\ncould be issued if all convertible securities (such as outstanding warrants) were\nexercised.\n\nA key difference between fully diluted shares and shares issued and outstanding is that\nthe total of fully diluted shares will include all the shares in the employee option pool\nthat are reserved but *not yet issued to* employees.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 If you\u2019re trying to figure out the likely percentage a number of shares will be worth\nin the future, it\u2019s best to know the number of shares that are fully diluted.\n\n\u2211 Even the fully diluted number may not take into account outstanding convertible\nsecurities (like convertible notes) that are *waiting* to be converted into stock at a\nfuture milestone.\nFor a more complete understanding, in addition to asking about the fully-diluted\ncapitalization you can ask about any convertible securities outstanding that are not\nincluded in that number.\n\n\u261d\ufe0f The terminology mentioned here isn\u2019t universally applied.\nIt\u2019s worth discussing these terms with your company to be sure you\u2019re on the same page.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A **capitalization table (cap table)** is a\n[table](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization-table.asp) (often a spreadsheet or\nother official record) that records the ownership stakes, including number and class of\nshares, of all shareholders in the company.\nIt is updated as stock is granted to new shareholders.[^cooleygoco.p5v68j]\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Better discuss future sources of dilution.\nDefine convertible securities and convertible notes and \u201c[fully diluted](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/fully-diluted-basis)\u201d\nmore. Do people say \u201cfully diluted\u201d but not include convertible securities?\n\n### Classes of Stock\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Investors often ask for rights to be paid back first in exchange for their investment.\nThe way these different rights are handled is by creating different\n[**classes of stock**](https://www.upcounsel.com/classes-of-stock). (These are also sometimes\ncalled [**classes of shares**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/class.asp), though that term\nhas another meaning in the context of mutual funds.)\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Two important classes of stock are\n[**common stock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock) and\n[**preferred stock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_stock). In general, preferred stock\nhas \u201c[rights, preferences, and privileges](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/publications/blt/2014/01/04_bigler/)\u201d\nthat common stock does not have.\nTypically, investors get preferred stock, and founders and employees get common stock (or\nstock options).\n\nThe exact number of classes of stock and the differences between them can vary company to\ncompany, and, in a startup, these can vary at [each round](#stages-of-a-startup) of funding.\n\n\u261d\ufe0f Another term you\u2019re likely to hear is\n[*founders\u2019 stock*](http://www.alleywatch.com/2013/08/what-is-founders-stock-legally/), which is\n(usually) common stock allocated at a company\u2019s formation, but otherwise doesn\u2019t have any\ndifferent rights from other common stock.[^lsvpwordpr.dgym96]\n\nAlthough preferred stock rights are too complex to cover fully, we can give a few key\ndetails:\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Preferred stock usually has a\n[**liquidation preference (or preference)**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation-preference.asp),\nmeaning the preferred stock owners will be paid before the common stock owners when a\n[liquidity event](#sales-and-liquidity) occurs, such as if the company is sold or goes public.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A company is in\n[**liquidation overhang**](https://equityzen.com/blog/startup-valuations-and-liquidation-preference-overhang/)\nwhen the value of the company doesn\u2019t reach the dollar amount investors put into it.\nBecause of liquidation preference, those holding preferred stock (investors) will have to\nbe paid before those holding common stock (employees).\nIf investors have put millions of dollars into a company and it\u2019s sold, employees\u2019 equity\nwon\u2019t be worth anything if the company is in liquidation overhang and the sale doesn\u2019t\nexceed that amount.[^avccom2010.zxzhsl]\n\n\u261d\ufe0f The complexities of the liquidation preference are\n[infamous](https://venturebeat.com/2010/08/16/beware-the-trappings-of-liquidation-preference/).\nIt\u2019s worth understanding that investors and entrepreneurs negotiate a lot of the details\naround preferences, including:\n\n- The *multiple*, a number designating how many times the investor must be paid back before\n  common shareholders receive proceeds.\n  (Often the multiple is 1X, but it can be 2X or higher.)\n\n- Whether preferred stock is\n  [*participating*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participating_preferred_stock), meaning\n  investors get their money back and also participate in proceeds from common stock.\n\n- Whether there is a *cap*, which limits the payout if it is participating.\n\n- \u2211\n  [\ud83d\udd11This primer](https://medium.com/@CharlesYu/the-ultimate-guide-to-liquidation-preferences-478dda9f9332)\n  by Charles Yu gives a concise overview.\n  Founders and companies are affected significantly and in subtle ways by these\n  considerations.\n  For example, as lawyer Jos\u00e9 Ancer points out, common and preferred stockholders are\n  typically quite different and their incentives\n  [sometimes](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2017/10/13/common-stock-v-preferred-stock/)\n  [diverge](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2018/02/07/board-works-common-stock/).\n\n- \ud83d\udea7 What are good resources to mention that describe conversion of preferred stock to\n  common stock?\n\n\ud83d\udd39 For the **purposes of an employee who holds common stock**, the most important thing to\nunderstand about preferences is that they\u2019re not likely to matter if a company does well\nin the long term.\nIn that case, every stockholder has valuable stock they can eventually sell.\nBut if a company fails or [exits](#sales-and-liquidity) for less than investors had hoped,\nthe preferred stockholders are generally first in line to be paid back.\nDepending on how favorable the terms are for the investor, if the company exits at a low\nor modest valuation, it\u2019s likely that common shareholders will receive little\u2014or nothing\nat all.\n\n## How Equity Is Granted\n\nIn this section we\u2019ll lay out how equity is granted in practice, including the\ndifferences, benefits, and drawbacks of common types of equity compensation, including\nrestricted stock awards, stock options, and restricted stock units (RSUs).\nWe\u2019ll go over a few less common types as well.\nWhile the [intent](#the-goals-of-equity-compensation) of each kind of equity grant is\nsimilar, they differ in many ways, particularly around how they are\n[taxed](#taxes-on-equity-compensation).\n\nExcept in rare cases where it may be negotiable, the type of equity you get is up to the\ncompany you work for.\nIn general, larger companies grant RSUs, and startups grant stock options, and\noccasionally executives and very early employees get restricted stock awards.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Add section on when equity is granted, including plus-ups.\n\n### Restricted Stock Awards\n\nAt face value, the most direct approach to equity compensation would be for the company to\naward stock to an employee in exchange for work.\nIn practice, it turns out a company will only want to do this with restrictions on how and\nwhen the stock is fully owned.\n\nEven so, this is actually one of the least common ways to get equity.\nWe mention it first because it is the simplest form of equity compensation, useful for\ncomparison as things get more complex.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A **restricted stock award** is when a company grants someone stock as a form of\ncompensation. The stock awarded has additional conditions on it, including a vesting\nschedule, so is called **restricted stock**. Restricted stock awards may also be called\nsimply **stock awards** or **stock grants**.\n\n\u2211 What *restricted* means here is actually\n[complex](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation/issues/24). It refers to the fact\nthat the stock (i) has certain restrictions on it (like transfer restrictions) required\nfor private company stock, and (ii) will be subject to repurchase at cost pursuant to a\nvesting schedule.\nThe repurchase right lapses over the service-based vesting period, which is what is meant\nin this case by the stock \u201cvesting.\u201d\n\n\u261d\ufe0f Restricted stock awards are\n[not the same](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/the-difference-between-a-restricted-stock-unit-res.aspx)\nthing as restricted stock units.\n\nTypically, stock awards are limited to executives or very early hires, since once the\nvalue of the shares increases, the tax burden of receiving them (without paying the\ncompany for their value) can be too great for most people.\nUsually, instead of restricted stock, an employee will get stock options.\n\n### Stock Options\n\n\ud83c\udd33 [**Stock options**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_stock_option) are contracts that\nallow individuals to buy a specified number of shares in the company they work for at a\nfixed price. Stock options are the most common way early-stage companies grant equity.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A person who has received a stock option grant is not a shareholder until they\n**exercise** their option, which means purchasing some or all of their shares at the strike\nprice. Prior to exercising, an option holder does not have voting rights.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 The **strike price (or exercise price)** is the fixed price per share at which stock can\nbe purchased, as set in a stock option agreement.\nThe strike price is generally set lower (often much lower) than what people expect will be\nthe *future* value of the stock, which means selling the stock down the road could be\nprofitable.\n\n\u261d\ufe0f *Stock options* is a confusing term.\nIn investment, an *option* is a right (but not an obligation) to buy something at a\ncertain price within a certain time frame.\nYou\u2019ll often see stock options discussed in the context of\n[investment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp). What investors in\nfinancial markets call *stock options* are indeed options on stock, but they are not\n*compensatory* stock options awarded for services.\nIn this Guide, and most likely in any conversation you have with an employer, anyone who\nsays \u201cstock options\u201d will be referring to compensatory stock options.\n\n\u261d\ufe0f Stock options are not the same as stock;\nthey are only the *right to buy stock* at a certain price and under a set of conditions\nspecified in an employee\u2019s stock option agreement.\nWe\u2019ll get into these conditions next.\n\n\u2211 Although everyone typically refers to \u201cstock options\u201d in the plural, when you receive a\nstock option grant, you are receiving *an option* to purchase a given number of shares.\nSo technically, it\u2019s incorrect to say someone \u201chas 10,000 stock options.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s best to understand the financial and [tax implications](#taxes-on-isos-and-nsos) before\ndeciding [when to exercise](#stock-option-scenarios) options.\nIn order for the option to be tax-free to receive, the strike price must be the fair\nmarket value of the stock on the date the option is granted.\n\n\u2211 Those familiar with\n[stock trading](https://www.investopedia.com/university/stocks/stocks3.asp) (or those with\neconomics degrees) will tell you about the\n[**Black-Scholes model**](https://www.investopedia.com/university/options-pricing/black-scholes-model.asp),\na general mathematical model for determining the value of options.\nWhile theoretically sound, this does not have as much practical application in the context\nof employee stock options.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Any real-world examples or statistics of how low strike price has led to big payoffs?\nAlso we could mention and relate this to the term *employee stock options (or ESOs)* and\ndispel any confusion between ESOs and ESPPs.\n\n### Vesting and Cliffs\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Vesting** is the process of gaining full legal rights to something.\nIn the context of compensation, founders, executives, and employees typically gain rights\nto their grant of equity incrementally over time, subject to restrictions.\nPeople may refer to their shares or stock options vesting, or may say that a person is\nvesting or has fully vested.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 In the majority of cases, vesting occurs incrementally over time, according to a\n**vesting schedule**. A person vests only while they work for the company.\nIf the person quits or is terminated immediately, they get no equity, and if they stay for\nyears, they\u2019ll get most or all of it.\n\nAwards of stock, stock options, and RSUs are almost always subject to a vesting schedule.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Vesting schedules can have a **cliff** designating a length of time that a person must\nwork before they vest at all.\n\nFor example, if your equity award had a one-year cliff and you only worked for the company\nfor 11 months, you would not get anything, since you haven\u2019t vested in any part of your\naward. Similarly, if the company is sold within a year of your arrival, depending on what\nyour paperwork says, you may receive nothing on the sale of the company.\n\nA very common vesting schedule is vesting over **4 years**, with a **1 year** cliff.\nThis means you get 0% vesting for the first 12 months, 25% vesting at the 12th month, and\n1/48th (2.08%) more vesting each month until the 48th month.\nIf you leave just before a year is up, you get nothing, but if you leave after 3 years,\nyou get 75%.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 In some cases, vesting may be triggered by specific events outside of the vesting\nschedule, according to contractual terms called **accelerated vesting (or acceleration)**.\nTwo kinds of accelerated vesting that are commonly negotiated are if the company is sold\nor undergoes a merger (**single trigger**) or if it\u2019s sold and the person is fired (**double\ntrigger**).\n\n\ud83c\udf2a Cliffs are an important topic.\nWhen they work well, cliffs are an effective and reasonably fair system to both employees\nand companies.\nBut they can be abused and their complexity can lead to misunderstandings:\n\n- The intention of a cliff is to make sure new hires are committed to staying with the\n  company for a significant period of time.\n  However, the flip side of vesting with cliffs is that if an employee is leaving\u2014quits or\n  is laid off or fired\u2014just short of their cliff, they may walk away with no stock ownership\n  at all, sometimes through no fault of their own, as in the event of a family emergency or\n  illness. In situations where companies fire or lay off employees just before a cliff, it\n  can easily lead to hard feelings and even lawsuits (especially if the company is doing\n  well enough that the stock is worth a lot of money).[^inccombusi.oldydy][^bloombergc.a48epn]\n- \ud83d\udd39 As a manager or founder, if an employee is performing poorly or may have to be laid\n  off, it\u2019s both thoughtful and wise to let them know what\u2019s going on well before their\n  cliff.\n- \u2211 Founders often have vesting on their stock themselves.\n  As entrepreneur Dan Shapiro explains, this is often for\n  [good reason](http://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2012/04/vesting-is-a-hack/).\n- \ud83d\udd39 As an employee, if you\u2019re leaving or considering leaving a company before your vesting\n  cliff is met, consider waiting.\n  Or, if your value to the company is high enough, you might\n  [negotiate](https://www.businessinsider.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-cliff-vesting-2011-5)\n  to get some of your stock \u201c[vested up](https://www.foley.com/when-should-vesting-of-equity-grants-accelerate-06-19-2014/)\u201d\n  early. Your manager may well agree that is is fair for someone who has added a lot of\n  value to the company to own stock even if they leave earlier than expected, especially for\n  something like a family emergency.\n  These kinds of vesting accelerations are entirely discretionary, however, unless you\n  negotiated for special acceleration in an employment agreement.\n  Such special acceleration rights are typically reserved for executives who negotiate their\n  employment offers heavily.\n- \ud83d\udea7 How does taking time off, for example a leave of absence, affect the vesting schedule?\n- Acceleration when a company is sold (called\n  [*change of control*](http://stockoptioncounsel.com/blog/change-of-control-terms-for-startup-stock-options-restricted-stock-and-rsus/2018/6/4)\n  terms) is common for founders and not so common for employees.\n  It\u2019s worth understanding acceleration and triggers in case they show up in your option\n  agreement, but these may not be something you can negotiate unless you are going to be in\n  a key role.\n- Companies may impose additional restrictions on stock that is vested.\n  For example, your shares are very likely subject to a right of first refusal, which means\n  that you can\u2019t sell the stock without offering it first to the company.\n  And it can happen that companies reserve the right to\n  [repurchase](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianahembree/2018/01/10/startup-employee-alert-can-your-company-take-back-your-vested-stock-options/#75fb48ee6e49)\n  vested shares in certain events.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Can we give any examples here?\n\n### How Options Expire\n\n\ud83c\udd33 The **exercise window (or exercise period)** is the period during which a person can buy\nshares at the strike price.\nOptions are only exercisable for a fixed period of time, until they expire, typically\nseven to ten years as long as the person is working for the company.\nBut this window is not always open.\n\n\u2757 **Expiration after termination.**\nOptions can expire after you quit working for the company.\nOften, the expiration is **90 days** after termination of service, making the options\neffectively worthless if you cannot exercise before that point.\nAs we\u2019ll get into later, you need to understand the costs, [taxes](#taxes-on-isos-and-nsos),\nand tax [liabilities](#the-amt-trap) of exercise and to plan ahead.\nIn fact, you can find out when you are granted the options, or better yet, before you sign\nan offer letter.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Longer exercise windows.**\nRecently (since around 2015) a few companies are finding ways to keep the exercise window\nopen for years after leaving a company, promoting this practice as fairer to employees.\nCompanies with\n[extended exercise windows](https://github.com/holman/extended-exercise-windows) include\nAmplitude,[^amplitudec.fvea8b] Clef,[^githubcomc.ygtolb] Coinbase,[^mediumcomb.nqs9mo] Pinterest,[^fortunecom.nnfd6o] and Quora.[^quoracomwh.4dxi02]\nHowever, the 90-day exercise window remains the norm.\n\n\ud83c\udf2a **The exercise window debate.**\nWhether to have extended exercise windows has been debated at significant length.\nSome believe extended exercise windows are\n[the future](https://triplebyte.com/blog/extending-stock-option-exercise-window-guide#.12rv7ovrv),\narguing that a shorter window makes a company\u2019s success a\n[punishment](http://stockoptioncounsel.com/blog/nc7go8ivzxb1el5rhv6nltrjan0n2t/2017/3/6) to\nearly employees.\n\nKey considerations include:\n\n- Everyone agrees that employees holding stock options with an expiring window often have to\n  make a painful choice if they wish to leave:\n  Pay for a substantial tax bill (perhaps five to seven figures) on top of the cost to\n  exercise (possibly looking for [secondary liquidity or a loan](#can-you-sell-private-stock))\n  or walk away from the options.\n- Many familiar with this situation have spoken out\n  [forcefully](https://zachholman.com/posts/fuck-your-90-day-exercise-window/) against shorter\n  exercise windows, arguing that an employee can help grow the value of a company\n  substantially\u2014often having taken a lower salary in exchange for equity\u2014but end up with\n  [no ownership](https://triplebyte.com/blog/fixing-the-inequity-of-startup-equity) because\n  they\u2019re unable or unwilling to stay for the several years [typically needed](#ipos) before an\n  IPO or sale.\n- On the other side, a few companies and investors\n  [stand by](https://a16z.com/2016/06/23/options-timing/) the existing system, arguing that it\n  is better to incentivize people not to leave a company, or that long windows effectively\n  transfer wealth from employees who commit long-term to those who leave.\n- Some focused on the legalities also argue that it\u2019s a legal requirement of ISOs to have a\n  90-day exercise window.\n  While this is technically true, it\u2019s not the\n  [whole story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9254299). It is possible for companies to\n  extend the exercise window by changing the nature of the options (converting them from\n  ISOs to NSOs) and [many companies](https://github.com/holman/extended-exercise-windows) now\n  choose to do just that.\n- Another path is to\n  [split the difference](http://stockoptioncounsel.com/blog/early-expiration-of-startup-stock-options-part-2-the-full-10-year-term-solution/2017/3/28)\n  and give extended windows only to longer-term employees.\n- Taken together, it\u2019s evident many employees have not been clear on the nuances of this\n  when joining companies, and some have\n  [\ud83d\udd11suffered](https://medium.com/@ben_mathes/90-days-and-my-six-figure-mistake-a495f4a188e2)\n  because of it.\n  With the risks of short exercise windows for employees becoming more widely known, longer\n  exercise windows are gradually becoming more prevalent.\n  As an employee or a founder, it is fairer and wiser to understand and negotiate these\n  things up front, and avoid unfortunate surprises.\n\n\u261d\ufe0f Options granted to advisors typically vest over a shorter period than employee grants,\noften one to two years.\nAdvisor grants also typically have a longer exercise window post termination of service,\nand will usually have single trigger acceleration on an acquisition, because no one\nexpects advisors to stay on with a company once it\u2019s acquired.\nTypical terms for advisors, including equity levels, are available in the\n[\ud83d\udce5Founder/Advisor Standard Template (FAST)](https://fi.co/contents/fast#), from the Founder\nInstitute.\n\n### Kinds of Stock Options\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Compensatory stock options come in two flavors, **incentive stock options (ISOs)** and\n**non-qualifying stock options (NQOs, or NQSOs)**. Confusingly, lawyers and the IRS use\n[several names](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc427) for these two kinds of stock options,\nincluding **statutory stock options** and **non-statutory stock options (or NSOs)**,\nrespectively.\n\nIn this Guide, we refer to ISOs and NSOs.\n\n| Type | Also called |\n| - | - |\n| Statutory | Incentive stock option, ISO |\n| Non-statutory | Non-qualifying stock option, NQO, NQSO, NSO |\n\n- Companies generally decide to give ISOs or NSOs depending on the legal advice they get.\n  It\u2019s rarely up to the employee which they will receive, so it\u2019s best to know about both.\n  There are pros and cons of each from both the recipient\u2019s and the company\u2019s perspective.\n- ISOs are common for employees because they have the possibility of being more favorable\n  from a tax point of view than NSOs.\n- \ud83d\udd38 ISOs can only be granted to employees (not independent contractors or directors who are\n  not also employees).\n- But ISOs have a number of limitations and conditions and can also create difficult\n  [tax consequences](#taxes-on-isos-and-nsos).\n\n### Early Exercise\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Sometimes, to help reduce the tax burden on stock options, a company will make it\npossible for option holders to **early exercise (or forward exercise)** their options, which\nmeans they can exercise even before they vest.\nThe option holder becomes a stockholder sooner, after which the vesting applies to actual\nstock rather than options.\nThis will have [tax implications](#83b-elections).\n\n\ud83d\udd38 However, the company has the right to repurchase the *unvested* shares, at the price\npaid or at the fair market value of the shares (whichever is lower), if a person quits\nworking for the company.\nThe company will typically repurchase the unvested shares should the person leave the\ncompany before the stock they\u2019ve purchased vests.\n\n### Restricted Stock Units\n\nWhile stock options are the most common form of equity compensation in smaller private\ncompanies, RSUs have become the most common type of equity award for public and large\nprivate companies.\nFacebook pioneered the use of RSUs as a private company to allow it to avoid having to\nregister as a public company earlier.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Why? More links on history of RSUs and Facebook story?\n\n\ud83c\udd33\n[**Restricted stock units (RSUs)**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp)\nrefer to an agreement by a company to issue an employee shares of stock or the cash value\nof shares of stock on a future date.\nEach unit represents one share of stock or the cash value of one share of stock that the\nemployee will receive in the future.\n(They\u2019re called *units* since they are neither stock nor stock options, but another thing\naltogether that is contractually linked to the value of stock.)\n\n\ud83c\udd33 The date on which an employee receives the shares or cash payment for RSUs is known as\nthe **settlement date**.\n\n- \ud83d\udd38 RSUs may vest according to a vesting schedule.\n  The settlement date may be the time-based vesting date or a later date based on, for\n  instance, the date of a company\u2019s IPO.\n- RSUs are difficult in a startup or early stage company because when the RSUs vest, the\n  value of the shares might be significant, and taxes will be owed on the receipt of the\n  shares.[^thestartup.tn6iyt] This is not a bad result when the company has sufficient capital to help the\n  employee make the tax payments, or the company is a public company that has put in place a\n  program for selling shares to pay the taxes.\n  But for cash-strapped private startups, neither of these are possibilities.\n  This is the reason most startups use stock options rather than RSUs or stock awards.\n- RSUs are often considered less preferable to grantees since they remove control over when\n  you owe tax. Options, if granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of\n  the stock, are not taxed until exercise, an event under the control of the optionee.\n  If an employee is awarded an RSU or restricted stock award which vests over time, they\n  will be taxed on the vesting schedule;\n  they have been put on \u201cautopilot\u201d with respect to the timing of the tax event.\n  If the shares are worth a lot on the date of vesting, the tax burden can be significant.\n- \u261d\ufe0f You don\u2019t want to confuse *restricted stock units* with *restricted stock*, which\n  typically refers to restricted stock awards.\n\n### Less Common Types of Equity\n\nWhile most employee equity compensation takes the form of stock, stock options, or RSUs, a\ncomplete tour of equity compensation must mention a few less common forms.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Phantom equity** is a type of compensation award that references equity, but does not\nentitle the recipient to actual ownership in a company.\nThese awards come under a variety of different monikers, but the key to understanding them\nis knowing that they are really just cash bonus plans, where the cash amounts are\ndetermined by reference to a company\u2019s stock.\nPhantom equity can have significant value, but may be perceived as less valuable by\nworkers because of the contractual nature of the promises.\nPhantom equity plans can be set up as purely discretionary bonus plans, which is less\nattractive than owning a piece of something.\n\nTwo examples of phantom equity are phantom stock and stock appreciation rights:\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A\n[**phantom stock**](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/12/introduction-phantom-stock.asp)\naward is a type of phantom equity that entitles the recipient to a payment equal to the\nvalue of a share of the company\u2019s stock, upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\n\ud83c\udd33\n[**Stock appreciation rights (SARs)**](https://www.nceo.org/articles/phantom-stock-appreciation-rights-sars)\nare a type of phantom equity that gives the recipient the right to receive a payment\ncalculated by reference to the appreciation in the equity of the company.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Elaboration needed on what events typically trigger phantom stock.\nMore data on how rare these are?\nAnd what is appreciation?\n\n\ud83c\udd33 [**Warrants**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_%28finance%29) are another kind of option\nto purchase stock, generally used in investment transactions (for example, in a\nconvertible note offering, investors may also get a warrant, or a law firm may ask for one\nin exchange for vendor financing).\nThey differ from stock options in that they are more abbreviated and stand-alone legal\ndocuments, not granted pursuant to a single legal agreement (typically called a \u201c[plan](#documents-and-agreements)\u201d)\nfor all employees.\n\nEmployees and advisors may not encounter warrants, but it\u2019s worth knowing they exist.\n\n## Tax Basics\n\nThe awarding of equity compensation can give rise to multiple types of taxes for the\nrecipient, including federal and state income taxes and employment taxes.\nThere\u2019s a lot that you have to be aware of. [Skip ahead](#taxes-on-equity-compensation) to\nunderstand how taxes on equity work, but if you have time, this section gives a technical\nsummary of tax fundamentals, just in case you never really figured out all the numbers on\nyour pay stub.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to know every detail, and can rely on software and professionals to\ndetermine the tax you owe, but we do suggest understanding the different kinds of taxes,\nhow large they can be, and how each is \u201ctriggered\u201d by different events.\n\nGiven the complexity, most taxpayers aren\u2019t aware of exactly how their tax is calculated.\nIt does take up thousands of pages[^slatecomar.qqwwen] of the federal tax code and involves the intricate\ndiversity of state tax law as well.[^gpogovfdsy.clz3vr]\n\n\u261d\ufe0f If you\u2019re already familiar with tax terminology, this section may not have any major\nsurprises. But for those who are not used to it, watch out:\nMany terms sound like regular English, but they\u2019re not. *Ordinary income*, *long-term* and\n*short-term*, *election*, *qualified small business*, and other phrases have very specific\nmeanings we\u2019ll do our best to spell out.\n\n### Kinds of Income\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Income** is the money an individual makes.\nFor tax purposes, there are two main types of income, which are taxed differently.\n[**Ordinary income**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp) includes wages,\nsalary, bonuses and interest made on investments.\n[**Capital gains**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) are the profits an\nindividual makes from selling assets, including stock.\n\nOne key difference between ordinary income and capital gains is that when capital gains\ntaxes are calculated, consideration is given not just to the sale price of the asset but\nto the total gain or loss the investment incurred, each outcome having significantly\ndifferent tax consequences.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Capital gains are classified as long-term or short-term. **Long-term capital gains** are\nthe profits an individual makes from selling assets, such as stock, a business, a house,\nor land, that were held for more than a year. **Short-term capital gains** are profits from\nthe sale of assets held for less than a year.\n\nAlthough this topic is not without\n[\ud83d\udcb0controversy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-should-capital-gains-be-taxed-1425271052),\nthe general idea is, if you are selling something you\u2019ve owned for a long time, you can be\ntaxed a lower rate.\n\nAll these rates have evolved over time based on economic and political factors,[^taxpolicyc.sjye20] so you\ncan be confident they will change again in the future.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 In 2017, Congress passed the\n[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017) (TCJA),\nwhich made\n[many changes](https://heritageinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/TCJA-HIG-Old-vs.-New-Comparison.pdf)\nto tax rates for the **2018** tax year.\nLong-term capital gains taxes did\n[not change](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/your-simple-guide-to-the-new-capital-gains-tax-rates-2018-04-16)\nsignificantly.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Can we clarify the term *investment income* too?\n\n### Federal Taxes\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Income tax** is the money paid by individuals to federal, state, and, in some cases,\nlocal governments, and includes taxation of ordinary income and capital gains.\nGenerally, U.S. citizens, residents, and some\n[foreigners](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/nra-withholding) must\n[file](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p17.pdf) and pay federal income tax.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 In general, federal tax applies to many\n[kinds of income](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc400.html). If you\u2019re an employee at a\nstartup, you need to consider four kinds of federal tax, each of which is computed\ndifferently.\n\n\u261d\ufe0f When it comes to equity compensation, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll have to worry about\n*all of these*, depending on your situation.\nThat\u2019s why we have a lot to cover here:\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Ordinary income tax** is the tax on wages or salary income, and short-term investment\nincome. The term **short-term capital gains tax** may be applied to taxes on assets sold\nless than a year from purchase, but profits from these sales are taxed as ordinary income.\nFor a lot of people who make most of their money by working, ordinary income tax is the\nbiggest chunk of tax they pay.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 **Employment taxes** are an additional kind of federal tax beyond ordinary income tax,\nand consist of Social Security and\n[Medicare taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/questions-and-answers-for-the-additional-medicare-tax)\nthat are withheld from a person\u2019s paycheck.\nEmployment taxes are also referred to as\n[**payroll taxes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll_tax) as they often show up on employee\npay stubs.

Because you are *electing* (choosing) to pay taxes\n  early in exchange for this treatment by the IRS. Does the IRS secretly enjoy making simple\n  concepts sound confusing?\n  We\u2019re not sure.\n- An 83(b) election isn\u2019t guaranteed to reduce your taxes, however.\n  For example, the value of the stock may not increase.\n  And if you leave the company before you vest, you *don\u2019t* get back the taxes you\u2019ve\n  already paid.\n- \u2757 You must file the 83(b) election yourself with the IRS\n  [**within 30 days**](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2012-28_IRB/ar12.html) of the grant or exercise, or\n  the opportunity is irrevocably lost.\n- \u261d\ufe0f Note an 83(b) election is made on receipt of actual shares of stock.\n  Technically, it cannot be made on the receipt of a stock *option* itself:\n  You first must exercise that option, then file the election.\n- If you receive an early exercisable stock option (when you don\u2019t have to wait for the the\n  stock to vest), you can make an 83(b) election upon receipt of the exercised shares.\n- Section 83(b) elections do not apply to vested shares;\n  the election only applies to stock that is not yet vested.\n  Thus, if you receive options that are *not* early exercisable (meaning you have to wait\n  until they vest to exercise), an 83(b) election would not apply.\n- \ud83d\udd39 Founders and very early employees will almost always want to do an 83(b) election upon\n  the receipt of unvested shares, since the stock value is probably low.\n  If the value is really low, and the taxes owed are not that great, you can make the\n  election without having to pay much tax and start your capital gains holding period on the\n  shares.\n- \ud83d\udea7 Clarify here which types of equity compensation the 83b can apply to.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 With the passage of the\n[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017) (TCJA) in\n2017, Congress approved a\n[**new Section 83(i)**](https://www.wsgr.com/WSGR/Display.aspx?SectionName=publications/PDFSearch/wsgralert-section-83i.htm)\nthat is intended to allow deferral of tax until RSU and stock option holders can sell\nshares to pay the tax bill.\nWhether companies will choose or be able to make this available to employees is\n[not clear](http://stockoptioncounsel.com/blog/tax-deferred-option-exercises-under-the-new-section-83i-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-of-2017)\nyet.\n\n### 409A Valuations\n\nWhen a person\u2019s stock vests, or they exercise an option, the IRS determines the tax that\nperson owes. But if no one is buying and selling stock, as is the case in most startups,\nthen the value of the stock\u2014and thus any tax owed on it\u2014is not obvious.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 The **fair market value (FMV)** of any good or property refers to a price upon which the\nbuyer and seller have agreed, when both parties are willing, knowledgeable, and not under\ndirect pressure to carry out the exchange.\nThe fair market value of a company\u2019s stock refers to the price at which a company will\nissue stock to its employees, and is used by the IRS to calculate how much tax an employee\nowes on any equity compensation they receive.\nThe FMV of a company\u2019s stock is determined by the company\u2019s most recent 409A valuation.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A\n[**409A valuation**](http://www.fenwick.com/FenwickDocuments/409_Valuations_Stock_Options.pdf) is\nan assessment private companies are required by the IRS to conduct regarding the value of\nany equity the company issues or offers to employees.\nA company wants the 409A to be low, so that employees make more off options, but not so\nlow the IRS won\u2019t consider it reasonable.\nIn order to minimize the risk that a 409A valuation is manipulated to the benefit of the\ncompany, companies hire independent firms to perform 409A valuations, typically annually\nor after events like fundraising.\n\nThe 409A valuation of employee equity is usually much less than what investors pay for\npreferred stock;\noften, it might be only a third or less of the preferred stock price.\n\n\ud83c\udf2a Although the 409A process is required and completely standard for startups, the\npractice is a strange mix of formality and complete guesswork.\nIt has been called \u201cquite precise\u2014remarkably inaccurate,\u201d by venture capitalist Bill\nGurley. You can read more about its\n[nuances and controversies](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dealbook/valuation-shell-game-silicon-valleys-dirty-secret.html).\n\n- \ud83d\udea7 More on when 409As happen.\n\n  - A 409A does have to happen every 12 months to grant the company safe harbor.\n  - A 409A has to be done after any event that could be deemed a \u201cmaterial event,\u201d which is a\n    fancy way of saying any event that could change the price or value of the company\n    meaningfully. Other examples could be if a CEO leaves, if the company starts making a ton\n    of money, or an acquisition.\n\n- \u2211 \u201cFMV\u201d is a legal term defined in Supreme Court Case 546,\n  [United States vs. Cartwright](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4964174066744569590&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr#p551).\n\n- \u2211 \u201c409A\u201d is a reference to the\n  [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code_section_409A) of the Internal\n  Revenue Code that sets requirements for options to be tax-free on grant.\n\n### Taxes on ISOs and NSOs\n\nTypically, early to mid-stage companies grant stock options, which may be\n[ISOs or NSOs](#kinds-of-stock-options).\n\n- \u2757When you get stock options and are considering if and when to exercise, you need to think\n  about the taxes and **when you owe them**. In principle, you need to think about taxes you\n  may incur at three points in time:\n  - at **time of grant**\n  - at **time of exercise**\n  - at **time of sale**\n- These events trigger ordinary tax (high), long-term capital gains (lower), or AMT\n  (possibly high) taxes in different ways for NSOs and ISOs.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 The taxes at time of exercise will depend on the gain between the strike price and the\nFMV, known as the **spread** or the\n[**bargain element**](http://www.investorwords.com/5414/bargain_element.html).\n\n- \ud83d\udd39 If you\u2019re granted ISOs or NSOs at a low strike price, and the bargain element is zero,\n  then you may be able to exercise at a reasonable price without triggering taxes at all.\n  So assuming the company allows it, it makes sense to early exercise *immediately* (buying\n  most or all of the shares, even though they\u2019re not vested yet) and simultaneously file an\n  83(b) election.\n- \ud83d\udd38 An 83(b) election, as already discussed, is the choice to be taxed on the receipt of\n  property even though you might have to forfeit or give back the property to the company.\n  You can make an election on the receipt of stock, but you cannot make the election on the\n  receipt of a stock option or an RSU because options and RSUs are not considered property\n  for the purposes of Section 83(b).\n- \ud83d\udea7 Move or remove this note, as it\u2019s covered earlier?\n- \ud83d\udd38 ISOs are often preferred by startups, as they\u2019re supposedly better for employees from a\n  tax perspective.\n  This assumes that (1) AMT won\u2019t be triggered and (2) you\u2019ll get a low long-term capital\n  gains rate by holding the stock for the appropriate holding periods.\n  However, often you either run afoul of the AMT trap, or don\u2019t hold the stock long enough\n  with the complicated 1 year + 2 year requirement, or the spread at exercise is small or\n  zero, so the difference wouldn\u2019t matter anyway.\n  NSOs do have a slightly higher tax because of the need to pay employment taxes on NSOs and\n  not ISOs.\n- \ud83c\udf2a Overall, it\u2019s not clear the ISO is that much better for employees, so\n  [many people](http://www.business2community.com/finance/nsos-better-isos-0826167#fz1HTCiOQxRyTr62.97)\n  argue [for NSOs](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2010/08/11/top-reasons-nqos-over-isos/)\n  instead.\n- \u261d\ufe0f This is partly because ISOs can make it harder to meet the long-term capital gains\n  holding period.[^thestartup.25gj0l]\n  Many people expect early exercise, together with an 83(b) election, will help them hold\n  the stock long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains.\n  While this is true for NSOs, a murky part of the rules on ISOs states that even with an\n  83(b) election, the capital gains holding period does not begin until the shares actually\n  vest. So if you want to immediately exercise an option and file a Section 83(b) election,\n  and you might have liquidity soon, it\u2019s better\u2014for those who can\u2014to do so with NSOs.\n\n### The AMT Trap\n\nWhen it comes to taxes and equity compensation, one scenario is so dangerous we give it\nits own section.\n\n\u2757 If you have received an ISO, exercising it may unexpectedly trigger a big AMT bill\u2014even\nbefore you actually make any money on a sale!\nIf there is a large spread between the strike price and the 409A valuation, you are\npotentially on the hook for an enormous tax bill, even if you can\u2019t sell the stock.\nThis has pushed people into bankruptcy.\nIt also caused Congress to grant a one-time forgiveness, the odds of which happening again\nare very low.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 The catastrophic scenario where exercising ISOs triggers a large AMT bill, with no\nability to sell the stock to pay taxes, is sometimes called the **AMT trap**. This\n[infamous](https://www.nceo.org/articles/stock-options-alternative-minimum-tax-amt) problem\nhas trapped many employees and\n[bankrupted](http://blog.sfgate.com/dgreenberg/2012/06/22/tax-advice-from-the-dot-com-bubble-beware-of-isos/)\npeople during past dot-com busts.\nNow more people know about it, but it\u2019s still a significant obstacle to plan around.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 In 2017, Congress passed the\n[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017) (TCJA),\nwhich increases AMT exemptions and their phaseout thresholds.\nThis means fewer people will be affected by AMT in 2018 than in prior years.[^mediumcomb.57vdab]\n\nNote that if your AMT applies to events prior to 2008, you\u2019re\n[off the hook](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2009/04/03/whoops-i-didnt-pay-amt-on-my-isos-exercised-prior-to-1108-what-do-i-do/).\n\nUnderstand this topic and talk to a professional if you exercise ISOs.\nThe AMT trap does not apply to NSOs.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Links to coverage on Congress\u2019s forgiveness?\n\n### Stock Awards vs. ISOs vs. NSOs\n\nBecause the differences are so nuanced, what follows is a summary of the taxes on\nrestricted stock awards, ISOs, and NSOs, from an employee\u2019s point of view.\n\n- **Restricted stock awards.**\n  Assuming vesting, you pay full taxes early with the 83(b) or at vesting:\n\n  - At grant:\n    - if 83(b) election filed, ordinary tax on FMV\n    - none otherwise\n  - At vesting:\n    - none if 83(b) election filed\n    - ordinary tax on FMV of vested portion otherwise\n  - At sale:\n    - long-term capital gains tax on gain if held for **1 year** past when taken into income\n    - ordinary tax otherwise (including immediate sale)\n\n- **NSOs.** You pay full taxes at exercise, and the sale is like any investment gain:\n\n  - At grant and vesting:\n    - no tax if granted at FMV\n  - At exercise:\n    - ordinary tax on the bargain element\n    - income and employment tax withholding on paycheck\n  - At sale:\n    - long-term capital gains tax on gain if held for **1 year** past exercise\n    -

If you miss this window, it could potentially have giant tax consequences, and is\n  essentially an irrevocable mistake\u2014it\u2019s one deadline the IRS won\u2019t extend.\n  When you file, get documentation from the post office as well as a delivery confirmation,\n  and include a self-addressed, stamped envelope for the IRS to send you a return receipt.\n  (Some people are so concerned about this they even ask a friend to go with them to the\n  post office as a witness!)\n- \u2757 Watch out for the AMT trap we\u2019ve already discussed.\n- \u2757 If you exercise your options, and your income had been from consulting rather than\n  employment (1099, not W-2), you will be subject to the\n  [self-employment tax](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/self-employment-tax-social-security-and-medicare-taxes),\n  which consist of both the employer and the employee side of FICA. In addition to owing the\n  normal income tax, this means you will owe the Social Security tax component (**6.2%**) up\n  to the FICA wage base, and you will owe the Hospital Insurance component (**2.9%**) on all\n  of your income.\n- \u2757 Thoughtfully decide when to exercise options.\n  As discussed, if you wait until the company is doing really well, or when you are leaving,\n  the delay can have serious downsides.\n\n## Plans and Scenarios\n\n### Evaluating Equity Compensation\n\nOnce you understand the [types of equity](#how-equity-is-granted) and their\n[tax implications](#taxes-on-equity-compensation), you have many of the tools you need to\nevaluate an offer that includes equity compensation, or to evaluate equity you currently\nhave in a company.\n\nIn summary, you have to determine or make educated guesses about several things:\n\n- **Equity value.** This can be estimated by the value the company may have in the future, and\n  the number of shares you may own.\n  - **Percentage ownership.**\n    As we\u2019ve mentioned, knowing how many shares of stock or stock options you have is\n    meaningless unless you know the number of outstanding shares.\n    What matters is the percentage ownership of the company the shares represent, including\n    the [details](#counting-shares) of how the total is counted.\n  - **Risk.** It is critical to understand [risk](#stages-of-a-startup) in the business and dilution\n    to ascertain the possible future value of equity.\n    [This article](http://codingvc.com/valuing-employee-options/) from Leo Polovets provides some\n    additional thoughts.\n- **Vesting.** Understand [when](#vesting-and-cliffs) you will receive the equity, as well as\n  whether you\u2019re able to exercise stock options (and pay the associated costs and taxes),\n  and whether you can do all this before your exercise window expires.\n- **Liquidity.** Determine when you will be able to [sell your shares](#sales-and-liquidity), and\n  if that is likely to be for a profit at that time.\n  (We talk about liquidity of private stock next.)\n- **Tax.** [Tax concerns](#taxes-on-equity-compensation) are inseparable from the value of equity.\n  Know the tax implications of your possible grant, exercise, vesting, and sale, in terms of\n  ordinary income tax, employment tax, long-term capital gains, and alternative minimum tax.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot, and even so, decisions are uncertain, but it is possible to make much more\ninformed decisions once you have this information.\n\n### What Is Private Stock Worth?\n\nWe now turn to the question of determining the value of private company stock.\nWe\u2019ve seen how stock in private companies often [can\u2019t be sold](#can-you-sell-private-stock),\nso its value is\n[difficult to estimate](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/11/valuing-private-companies.asp).\n\nThe value of equity you cannot yet sell is a reflection of three major concerns:\n\n1. How well the company is doing now\u2014that is, how profitable it is, or how many customers it\n   is attracting.\n2. How well the company will perform in the future.\n3. How likely it is the company will be valuable as part of another company\u2014that is, whether\n   it may be [acquired](#sales-and-liquidity).\n\nThe first concern is relatively clear, if you know the company\u2019s financials.\nThe second and third come down to predictions and are never certain.\nIn fact, it\u2019s important to understand just how uncertain all three of these estimations\nare, depending on the stage of the company.\n\nIn earlier stage private companies, there may be little or no profit, but the company may\nseem valuable because of high expectations that it can make future profit or be acquired.\nIf a company like this takes money from investors, the investors determine the price they\npay based on these educated guesses and market conditions.\n\nIn startups there tends to be a high degree of uncertainty about the future value of\nequity, while in later stage private companies financials are better understood (at least\nto investors and others with an inside view of the company), and these predictions are\noften more certain.\n\n### Can You Sell Private Stock?\n\nUltimately, the value of your equity depends on whether and when you are able to convert\nit into stock that you sell for cash.\nWith public companies, the answer is relatively easy to estimate\u2014as long as there are no\nrestrictions on your ability to sell, you know the current market value of the stock you\nown or might own.\nWhat about private companies?\n\nA liquidity event is usually what makes it possible for shareholders in a private company\nto sell their stock.\nHowever, individuals may sometimes be able to gain liquidity while a company is still\nprivate.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 A **secondary market (or secondary sale, or private sale)** transaction is when private\ncompany stock [is sold](https://www.cooleygo.com/secondary-sales-of-private-company-stock/)\nto another private party.\nThis is in contrast to **primary market** transactions, where companies sell directly to\ninvestors. Secondary sales are not routine, but they can sometimes occur, such as when an\nemployee sells to an accredited investor who wants to invest in the company.\n\n\ud83c\udd33 Shares held by an employee are typically subject to a **right of first refusal (ROFR)**\nin favor of the company, meaning the employee can\u2019t sell their shares to a third party\nwithout offering to sell their shares to the company first.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Private sales generally require the agreement and cooperation of the company, for both\ncontractual and practical reasons.\nWhile those who hold private stock may hope or expect they need only find a willing buyer,\nin practice secondary sales only work out in\n[a few situations](https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/19/secondary-market-for-shares-in-pre-ipo-unicorns-is-booming/).\n\nUnlike a transaction on a public exchange, the buyer and seller of private company stock\nare not in total control of the sale.\nThere are a few reasons **why companies may not support secondary sales**:\n\n- Historically, startups have seen little purpose in letting current employees sell their\n  stock, since they prefer employees hold their stock and work to make it more valuable by\n  improving the value of the company as a whole.\n- Even if employee retention is not a concern, there are reasons private sales may not be in\n  the company\u2019s interest.\n  Former employees and other shareholders often have difficulty initiating secondary\n  transactions with a company.[^wsjcomarti.vm6qmp]\n  Private buyers may ask for the company\u2019s internal financials in order to estimate the\n  current and future value of its stock;\n  the company may not wish to share this confidential information.\n- Companies must\n  [consider](https://www.square1bank.com/insights/new-normal-secondaries-409a-valuation-process/)\n  whether sales could influence their [409A valuation](#409a-valuations).\n- Secondary sales are an administrative and legal burden that may not make it to the top of\n  the list of priorities for busy startup CEOs and CFOs.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 However, participation in the secondary market has evolved in recent years,[^techcrunch.qn7usd][^industryve.6prupc][^mediumcomr.ez02hw] and **a few\noptions may be possible**:\n\n- [SharesPost](http://sharespost.com/), [Equidate](https://www.equidateinc.com/), and\n  [EquityZen](https://equityzen.com/) have sought to establish a market around secondary sales,\n  particularly for well-known pre-IPO companies.\n- A few other secondary firms have emerged that have interest in certain purchases,\n  especially for larger secondary sales from founders, early employees, or executives.\n  A company can work with a firm to facilitate multiple transactions.\n  These firms include [137 Ventures](http://137ventures.com/),\n  [ESO Fund](https://employeestockoptions.com/),\n  [Akkadian Ventures](https://www.akkadianventures.com/),\n  [Industry Ventures](http://www.industryventures.com/), [Atlas Peak](http://www.atlaspeakcap.com/),\n  and [Founders Circle](http://www.founderscircle.com/).\n- In some cases, an employee may have luck selling stock privately to an individual, like a\n  board member or former executive, who wishes to increase their ownership.\n  Further discussion can be found\n  [on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-employees-in-startups-sell-stock-in-the-secondary-markets).\n\n### Stock Option Scenarios\n\nThe key decisions around stock options are when to exercise and, if you can, when to sell.\nHere we lay out some common scenarios that might apply to you.\nConsidering these scenarios and their outcomes can help you evaluate your position and\ndecide what you should do.\n\n- **Exercise and hold.**\n  You can write the company a check and pay any taxes on the spread.\n  You are then a stockholder, with a stock certificate that may have value in the future.\n  As [discussed](#how-equity-is-granted), you may exercise:\n  - Early, even immediately upon grant.\n  - Before vesting (if early exercise is available to you).\n  - Sometime after vesting.\n  - After leaving the company, as long as the exercise window is open.\n    - \ud83d\udd38 Recall that the window is likely to [close soon](#how-options-expire) after you leave a\n      company, often 90 days after termination.\n- **Wait until acquisition.**\n  If the company is acquired for a large multiple of the exercise price, you may then use\n  your options to buy valuable stock.\n  However, as discussed, your shares could be worth next to nothing unless the sale price\n  exceeds the liquidation overhang.\n- \ud83d\udd38 **Secondary market.**\n  As [discussed](#can-you-sell-private-stock), in some cases it\u2019s possible to exercise and\n  sell the stock in a private company directly to a private party.\n  But this generally requires some cooperation from the company and is not something you can\n  always count on.\n- **Cashless exercise.**\n  In the event of an IPO, a broker can allow you to exercise all of your vested options and\n  immediately sell a portion of them into the public market, removing the need for cash up\n  front to exercise and pay taxes.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Note that some of these scenarios may require significant cash up front, so it makes\nsense to do the math early.\nIf you are in a tight spot, where you may lose valuable options altogether because you\ndon\u2019t have the cash to exercise, it\u2019s worth exploring each of the scenarios above, or\ncombinations of them, such as exercising and then selling a portion to pay taxes.\nIn addition, there are a [few funds](#can-you-sell-private-stock) and individual investors\nwho may be able to front you the cash to exercise or pay taxes in return for an agreement\nto share profits.\n\nAuthor and programmer Alex MacCaw\n[explores](https://blog.alexmaccaw.com/an-engineers-guide-to-stock-options#exercising_2) a few\nmore detailed scenarios.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Infographic:\nPossible visualization of these exercise options.\nA flowmap? \u201cIf this, then this\u201d (with arrows).\n\n### Summary of Dangers\n\nBecause of their importance, we\u2019ll wind up with a recap of some of the key dangers we\u2019ve\ndiscussed when thinking about equity compensation:\n\n- \u2757 When it comes to equity compensation, details matter!\n  You need to understand the type of stock grant or stock option in detail, as well as what\n  it means for your taxes, to know what your equity is worth.\n- \u2757 Because details are so important, [professional advice](#seeking-professional-advice) from\n  a tax advisor or lawyer familiar with equity compensation (or both) is often a good idea.\n  Avoid doing everything yourself, but also avoid blindly trusting advisors without having\n  them explain the details to you in a way you understand.\n- \u2757 With stock options, high exercise costs or high taxes, including the AMT trap, may\n  prevent you from exercising your options.\n  If you can\u2019t sell the stock and your exercise window is limited, you could effectively be\n  forced to walk away from your stock options.\n- \u2757 If a job offer includes equity, you need a lot of information to understand the value of\n  the equity component.\n  If the company trusts you enough to be making an offer but doesn\u2019t want to answer\n  questions about that offer, consider it a warning sign.\n  Next, we offer more details on what to ask about your offer, and how to negotiate to get\n  the answers you want.\n\n## Offers and Negotiations\n\nWhen a company offers any form of equity as part of its compensation package, there is a\nwhole new set of factors for a prospective employee to consider.\nThis chapter will help you prepare for negotiating a job offer that includes equity,\ncovering negotiation tips and expectations, and specific reminders on what you can ask and\nwhat is negotiable when it comes to equity.\n\n### Why Negotiation Matters\n\nBefore accepting any job offer, you\u2019ll want to negotiate\n[firmly and fairly](http://cefne.com/en/harvard-method-negotiation). You\u2019re planning to devote\na lot of your time and sanity to any full-time role;\nhelp yourself make sure that this is\n[\ud83d\udcb0what you want](https://hbr.org/2016/12/think-strategically-about-your-career-development).\n\n\u261d\ufe0f It\u2019s perfectly natural to be\n[anxious](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/the-impact-of-anxiety-and-emotions-on-negotiations-how-to-avoid-misjudgment-in-negotiation-scenarios/)\nabout negotiations, whether you\u2019re going through this process for the first time or the\ntenth. There is a lot at stake, and it can be uncomfortable and stressful to ask for\nthings you need or want.\nMany\n[people think](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyatarr/2017/12/31/here-are-five-negotiation-myths-we-can-leave-behind-in-2017/#250ff99b15f9engaging)\nnegotiating could get the job offer revoked, so they\u2019ll accept their offer with little or\nno discussion.\nBut remember that negotiations are the first experience you\u2019ll have of working with your\nnew team. If you\u2019re nervous, it can help to remind yourself why it\u2019s important to have\nthese conversations:\n\n- Negotiations ask you to focus on what you actually want.\n  What is important to you\u2014personal growth, career growth, impact, recognition, cash,\n  ownership, teamwork?\n  Not being clear with yourself on what your priorities really are is a recipe for\n  dissatisfaction later.\n- If you aren\u2019t satisfied with the terms of your offer, accepting it without discussion can\n  be tough not just for you but for your new company and colleagues as well.\n  No one wants to take on a hire who\u2019s going to walk away in just a few months when\n  something better comes along.\n  For everyone\u2019s sake, take your time now to consider what you want\u2014and then\n  [ask for it](https://www.earnest.com/decision-making/articles/negotiating-job-offers-science-asking-want).\n- The negotiation process itself can teach you a lot about a company and your future\n  manager. Talking about a tough subject like an offer is a great way to see how you\u2019ll work\n  with someone down the road.\n\nA Guide like this can\u2019t give you personalized advice on what a reasonable offer is, as\nthat depends greatly on your skills, the marketplace of candidates, what other offers you\nhave, what the company can pay, what other candidates the company has found, and the\ncompany\u2019s needs.\nBut we can cover the basics of what to expect with offers, and advise candidates on how to\napproach negotiations.\n\n### Equal Treatment\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Companies can and should work hard to ensure that all candidates are given\n[equal treatment](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/pay-equity/steps/introduction/) in the\nhiring process, but inequalities persist.[^iwprorgpub.1ukyxt]\nWorkplace disparities in pay and opportunity span race and gender,[^digitalcom.k5w0oc] with research\nfocusing on inequality in the U.S. workplace,[^pewresearc.dws8o8] executive leadership and its\nwell-documented lack of diversity,[^aflcioorgp.6v6p19][^fortunecom.87hw00] and the technology industry.[^eeocgoveeo.9aynwh]\nGender bias in negotiation itself is also an issue;\nmany women have been made to feel that they shouldn\u2019t ask for what they deserve.[^newyorkerc.mdcz9c]\n\nMore effort is needed to end biases and close the wage gap.\nAll candidates should take the time to understand their worth and the specific value they\ncan add to a company, so that they are fully prepared to negotiate for a better offer.\n\n### General Expectations\n\n- Many companies will give some leeway during [negotiations](#negotiation-tips), letting you\n  indicate whether you prefer\n  [higher salary](https://hired.com/blog/candidates/salary-vs-equity-how-decide-whats-right/) or\n  [higher equity](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/041515/equity-vs-salary-what-you-need-know.asp).\n- Candidates with competing offers almost always have more leverage and get better offers.[^shrmorgres.qv3vrf]\n- Salaries at startups are often a bit below what you\u2019d get at an established company, since\n  early on, cash is at a premium.\n  For very early stage startups, risk is higher, offers can be more highly variable, and\n  variation among companies will be greater, particularly when it comes to equity.\n- The dominant factors [determining equity](#typical-employee-equity-levels) are what funding\n  [stage](#stages-of-a-startup) a company is at, and the role you\u2019ll play at the company.\n  If no funding has been raised, large equity may be needed to get early team members to\n  work for very little or for free.\n  Once significant funding of an A round is in place, most people will take typical or\n  moderately discounted salaries.\n  Startups with seed funding lie somewhere in between.\n\n### Offers\n\n\ud83c\udd33 When making a job offer, companies will often give a candidate a **verbal offer** first,\nto speed things along and facilitate the negotiation, following it with a **written offer**\nif it seems like the candidate and the company are close to agreement on the terms of the\noffer. The written offer takes the form of an\n[\ud83d\udce5**offer letter**](https://www.upcounsel.com/employee-offer-letter), which is just the summary\nsent to the candidate, typically with an expiration date and other details and\n[paperwork](#documents-and-agreements).\n\nAlthough companies often want you to sign right away to save time and effort, if you\u2019re\ndoing it thoughtfully you\u2019ll also be talking to the company (typically with a hiring\nmanager, your future manager, or a recruiter, or some combination) multiple times before\nsigning. This helps you negotiate details and gives you a chance to get to know the people\nyou could be working with, the company, and the role, so that you can make the best\ndecision for your personal situation.\n\nWhen you are ready to accept the terms of the offer letter, you can go ahead and sign.\n\nThings to look for in the\n[offer letter](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/how-to-read-offer-letter/) include:\n\n- **Title and level.**\n  What your role is officially called, who you report to, and what level of seniority your\n  role is within the company.\n- **Salary.** What you\u2019re paid in cash, in a year, before taxes.\n- **Equity compensation.**\n  You know what this is now.\n- **Bonus.** Additional cash you\u2019ll get on a regular basis, if the company has a plan for this.\n- **[Signing bonus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/signing-bonus.asp).** Cash you get just\n  for signing. (Signing bonuses usually have some strings attached\u2014for example, you could\n  have to pay back the bonus if you leave the company within 12 or 24 months.)\n\nWhile the details may not be included in your offer letter, to get full information on\nyour total rewards you\u2019ll also want to discuss:\n\n- [Benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_benefits) like health insurance, retirement\n  savings, and snacks.\n- All other aspects of the job that might matter to you, like time off, ability to work from\n  home, flexible hours, training and education, and so on.\n\nA few general notes on these components (credits to\n[Cristina Cordova](https://twitter.com/cjc/status/984094472190349312) for some of these):\n\n- Early stage startups will focus on salary and equity and (if they are funded) benefits.\n  An offer of bonuses or a signing bonus are more common in larger, prosperous companies.\n- Bonuses are usually standardized to the company and your level, so are not likely to be\n  something you can negotiate.\n- The signing bonus is highly negotiable.\n  This doesn\u2019t mean any company will give large signing bonuses, but it\u2019s feasible because\n  signing bonus amounts vary candidate by candidate, and unlike salary and other bonuses,\n  it\u2019s a one-time cost to the company.\n\n### Offers From Startups\n\nBecause startups are so much smaller than many established companies, and because they may\ngrow quickly, there are additional considerations worth taking into account when\nnegotiating a job offer from a startup:\n\n- **Cash versus equity.**\n  If your [risk tolerance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp) is\n  reasonably high, you might ask for an offer with more equity and less cash.\n  If a company begins to do well, it\u2019ll likely \u201clevel up\u201d lower salaries (bringing them\n  closer to market average) even if you got more equity up front.\n  On the other hand, if you ask for more cash and less equity, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be able\n  to negotiate to get more equity later on, since equity is increasingly scarce over time\n  (at least in a successful company!). Entrepreneur and venture capitalist\n  [Mark Suster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Suster) stresses the need to\n  [level up](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/this-is-how-startups-level-up-after-raising-money-328d17076515)\n  by scaling pay and spending, focusing appropriately at each funding stage.\n  In the very early days of a startup, it\u2019s not uncommon for employees to have higher\n  salaries than the company\u2019s founders.[^siliconhil.1wd4aa]\n- \ud83d\udea7 What is risk and how should people think about risk tolerance?\n  Good readings on this?\n- **Title.** Negotiating title and exact details of your role early on may not matter as much\n  in a small and growing company, because your role and the roles of others may change a\n  lot, and quickly.\n  It\u2019s more important that you respect the founders and leaders of the company.\n  It\u2019s more important that you feel you are\n  [respected](https://blog.shrm.org/blog/respect-and-trust-top-the-list-of-most-important-employee-job-satisfaction).\n\n### Questions Candidates Can Ask\n\n\ud83d\udd39 It\u2019s important to ask questions when you get an offer that includes any kind of equity.\nIn addition to helping you learn the facts about the equity offer, the process of\ndiscussing these details can help you get a sense of the company\u2019s transparency and\nresponsiveness.\nHere are a few questions you should consider asking, especially if you\u2019re evaluating an\noffer from a startup or another private company:\n\n- **Percentage ownership.**\n  - *What percentage of the company do the shares represent?*\n  - *What set of shares was used to compute that percentage?\n    Is it outstanding shares or fully diluted?*\n  - *What convertible securities are outstanding (convertible notes, SAFEs, or warrants), and\n    how much dilution can I expect from their conversion?*\n- **Valuation.**\n  - *What did the last round value the company at?\n    (That is, what is the preferred share price times the total outstanding shares?)*\n  - *What is the most recent 409A valuation?\n    When was it done, and will it be done again soon?*\n  - *What exit valuation will need to be achieved before common stock has positive value (that\n    is, what are the liquidation overhangs)?*\n- **Stock options.**\n  - *Do you allow early exercise of my options?*\n  - *Am I required to exercise my options within 90 days after I leave or am terminated?\n    Does the company extend the exercise window of the options of employees that depart?*\n- **Vesting.**\n  - *Are all employees on the same vesting schedule?*\n  - *Is there any acceleration of my vesting if the company is acquired?*\n  - *Do you have a policy regarding follow-on stock grants?*\n  - *Does the company have any repurchase right to vested shares?*\n\nThis information will help you consider the benefits and drawbacks of possible\n[exercise scenarios](#stock-option-scenarios).\n\n\ud83d\udd39 If you\u2019re considering working for a startup, there are further questions to ask in\norder to assess the state of the company\u2019s business and its plans.\nBefore or when you\u2019re getting an offer is the right time to do this.\nStartups are understandably careful about sharing financial information, so you may not\nget full answers to all of these, but you should at least ask:\n\n- *How much money has the company raised (including in how many rounds, and when)?*\n- *What did the last round value the company at?*\n- *What is the aggregate liquidation preference on top of the preferred stock?*\n  (This will tell you how much the company needs to sell for before the common stock\u2014your\n  equity\u2014is worth something in an exit.)\n- *Will the company likely raise more capital soon?*\n- *How long will the company\u2019s current funding last?*\n  (This will likely be given at the current burn rate, or how quickly a company is spending\n  its funding, so will likely not include calculations for things like future employee\n  salaries.)\n- *What is the hiring plan?\n  (How many people over what time frame?)*\n- *What is the revenue now, if any?\n  What are the revenue goals/projections?*\n- *Where do you see this company in 1 year and 5 years, in terms of revenue, number of\n  employees, and market position?*\n\nThere are several other\n[resources](https://blog.wealthfront.com/stock-options-14-crucial-questions/) with\n[more questions](http://www.inc.com/atish-davda/5-questions-you-should-ask-before-taking-a-start-up-job-offer.html)\nlike this to consider.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Summarize the best items in the links above.\n\n### Typical Employee Equity Levels\n\n\ud83d\udea7 This section currently mostly covers startups;\nwhat later-stage resources are available?\n\nCompensation data is highly situational.\nWhat an employee receives in equity, cash, and benefits depends on the role they\u2019re\nfilling, the sector they work in, where they and the company are located, and the possible\nvalue that specific individual may bring to the company.\n\nAny compensation data out there is hard to come by.\nCompanies often pay for this data from\n[vendors](https://www.advanced-hr.com/products-overview), but it\u2019s usually not available to\ncandidates.\n\nFor startups, a variety of data is easier to come by.\nWe give some overview here of early-stage Silicon Valley tech startups;\nmany of these numbers are not representative of companies of different kinds across the\ncountry:\n\n- \ud83d\udd39 One of the best ways to tell what is reasonable for a given company and candidate is to\n  look at offers from companies with similar profiles on [AngelList](https://angel.co/). The\n  [**AngelList salary data**](https://angel.co/salaries) is extensive.\n- There are no hard and fast rules, but for **post-series A startups** in **Silicon Valley**,\n  the table below, based on\n  [the one by Babak Nivi](http://venturehacks.com/articles/option-pool-shuffle#market), gives\n  ballpark equity levels that many think are reasonable.\n  These would usually be for restricted stock or stock options with a standard 4-year\n  vesting schedule.\n  They apply if each of these roles were filled just after an A round and the new hires are\n  also being paid a salary (so are not founders or employees hired before the A round).\n  The upper ranges would be for highly desired candidates with strong track records.\n  - Chief executive officer (CEO): **5\u201310%**\n  - Chief operating officer (COO): **2\u20135%**\n  - Vice president (VP): **1\u20132%**\n  - Independent board member: **1%**\n  - Director: **0.4\u20131.25%**\n  - Lead engineer **0.5\u20131%**\n  - Senior engineer: **0.33\u20130.66%**\n  - Manager or junior engineer: **0.2\u20130.33%**\n- For **post-series B startups**, equity numbers would be much lower.\n  How much lower will depend significantly on the size of the team and the company\u2019s\n  valuation.\n- Seed-funded startups would offer higher equity\u2014sometimes much higher if there is little\n  funding, but base salaries will be lower.\n- Leo Polovets created a\n  [survey](http://codingvc.com/analyzing-angellist-job-postings-part-2-salary-and-equity-benchmarks)\n  of AngelList job postings from 2014, an excellent summary of equity levels for the first\n  few dozen hires at these early-stage startups.\n  For **engineers** in Silicon Valley, the highest (not typical!)\n  equity levels were:\n  - Hire #1: up to **2%\u20133%**\n  - Hires #2 through #5: up to **1%\u20132%**\n  - Hires #6 and #7: up to **0.5%\u20131%**\n  - Hires #8 through #14: up to **0.4%\u20130.8%**\n  - Hires #15 through #19: up to **0.3%\u20130.7%**\n  - Hires #21 [sic] through #27: up to **0.25%\u20130.6%**\n  - Hires #28 through #34: up to **0.25%\u20130.5%**\n- Jos\u00e9 Ancer gives another good\n  [overview](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2018/05/08/early-startup-employee-compensation/) for\n  early stage hiring.\n- *Founder* compensation is another topic entirely that may still be of interest to\n  employees. Jos\u00e9 Ancer provides a thoughtful\n  [overview](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2016/06/23/founder-compensation-cash-equity-liquidity/).\n\n### Negotiation Tips\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Structure: Move negotiation points earlier?\n\nWhen negotiating a job offer, companies will always ask you what you want for\ncompensation, and you should always be\n[cautious](http://review.chicagobooth.edu/strategy/2018/article/how-answer-one-toughest-interview-questions)\nabout answering.\n\nIf you name the lowest number you\u2019ll accept, you can be pretty sure the company\u2019s not\ngoing to exceed it, at least not by much.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Asking about salary expectations is a normal part of the hiring process at most\ncompanies, but asking about **salary history** has been banned in a growing number of\nstates, cities, and counties.[^hrdivecomn.56fguz]\nThese laws attempt to combat pay disparity[^nytimescom.yev52k] among women and minorities by making it\nillegal for companies to ask about or consider candidates\u2019 current or past compensation\nwhen making them offers.\nMake sure you understand the laws relevant to your situation.\n\nA few points on negotiating compensation:\n\n- Some argue that a\n  [good tactic](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-negotiate-make-first-offer-2014-5) in\n  negotiating is to start higher than you will be willing to accept, so that the other party\n  can \u201cwin\u201d by negotiating you down a little bit.\n  Keep in mind, this is just a suggested tactic, not a hard and fast rule.\n- If you are inexperienced and unsure what a fair offer should look like, avoid saying\n  exactly what you want for compensation very early in discussions.\n  Though many hiring managers and recruiters ask about\n  [salary expectations](http://fistfuloftalent.com/2018/01/ask-salary-without-asking-salary-expectations.html)\n  early in the process to avoid risk at the offer stage, some ask in order to take\n  advantage of candidates who don\u2019t have a good sense of\n  [their own worth](https://nuleadership.com/2018/01/08/know-your-worth-compensation-negotiation/).\n  Tell them you want to focus on the opportunity as a whole and your ability to contribute\n  before discussing numbers.\n  Ask them to give you a fair offer once they understand what you can bring to the company.\n- If you are experienced and know your value, it\u2019s often in your interest to state what sort\n  of compensation and role you are looking for to anchor expectations.\n  You might even share your expectations early in the process, so you don\u2019t waste each\n  other\u2019s time.\n- Discuss what your compensation might be like in the future.\n  No one can promise you future equity, salary, or bonuses, but it should be possible to\n  agree what those could look like *if* you demonstrate outstanding performance and the\n  company has money.\n- If you\u2019re moving from an established company to a startup, you may be asked to take a\n  [salary cut](https://www.quora.com/Should-you-take-a-salary-cut-if-you-join-a-startup). This\n  is reasonable, but it\u2019s wise to discuss explicitly how much the cut is, and when your\n  salary will be renegotiated.\n  For example, you might take 25% below your previous salary, but there can be an agreement\n  that this will be corrected if your performance is strong and the company gets funding.\n- \ud83d\udd39 Always negotiate\n  [non-compensation](http://www.kennedyexecutive.com/blog/salary-negotiation-33-things-negotiate-money/)\n  aspects before agreeing to an offer.\n  If you want a specific role, title, opportunity, visa sponsorship, parental leave, special\n  treatment (like working from home), or have timing constraints about when you can join,\n  [negotiate these early](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/negotiate-nonsalary-benefits-job-perks/),\n  not late in the process.\n- \ud83d\udd39 If you\u2019re going to be a very early employee, consider asking for a restricted stock\n  grant instead of stock options, and a cash bonus equal to the tax on those options.\n  The company will have some extra paperwork (and legal costs), but it means you won\u2019t have\n  to pay to exercise.\n  Then, if you file an 83(b) election, you\u2019re simplifying your situation even further,\n  eliminating the [AMT issues](#the-amt-trap) of ISOs, and maximizing your chances of\n  qualifying for long-term capital gains tax.\n- \ud83d\udea7 What other *specific* suggestions are helpful?\n\nA few notes on the negotiation process itself:\n\n- \ud83d\udd39 Although offer letters have expirations, it\u2019s often possible to negotiate more time if\n  you need it. How much flexibility depends on the situation.\n  Some have criticized \u201cexploding job offers\u201d as a\n  [bad practice](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-grant/its-time-to-eliminate-exp_b_4594222.html)\n  that makes [no sense](https://erikbern.com/2016/03/16/exploding-offers-are-bullshit.html) at\n  all. If you are likely the best candidate for the position, or the role is a specialized\n  and well-paid one where there are usually not enough good candidates to meet the demand,\n  you\u2019ll likely have plenty of leverage to\n  [ask for more time](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-politely-postpone-accepting-a-job-offer-2015-6#dont-be-afraid-to-negotiate-4),\n  which may be needed to complete the interview process with other companies.\n  Software engineering roles in tech companies are like this currently.\n- Getting\n  [multiple offers](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-guide-to-juggling-multiple-job-offers-and-coming-out-on-top)\n  is always in your interest.\n  If you have competing offers, sharing the competing offers with the company you want to\n  work for can be helpful, granted your offers are competitive.\n  - However, dragging out negotiations excessively so you can \u201cshop around\u201d an offer to other\n    companies is considered bad form by some;\n    it\u2019s thoughtful to be judicious and timely to the extent that it\u2019s possible.\n- \u2757 Get all agreements in writing, if they are not in your offer letter.\n- Do not accept an offer verbally or in writing unless you\u2019re ready to stand by your word.\n  In practice, people do occasionally accept an offer and then go back on it, or\n  [*renege*](https://purduecco.wordpress.com/2016/03/28/the-risks-of-reneging-on-a-job-offer/).\n  This can put the company in a difficult position (they may have declined another key\n  candidate based on your acceptance), and may hurt your reputation in unexpected ways\n  later.\n\nSome additional resources:\n\n- Harvard Business Review has a variety of general\n  [\ud83d\udcb0suggestions](https://hbr.org/2014/04/15-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer) on negotiation\n  processes.\n- Robby Grossman, a VP at Wistia, gives a good\n  [overview](http://rob.by/2013/negotiating-your-startup-job-offer) of equity compensation and\n  negotiation suggestions in startups.\n\n### Offer and Negotiation Dangers\n\nTo wind up our discussion of offers and negotiations, here are some key dangers and\nmistakes to watch out for:\n\n- \u2757 Do not accept an offer of stock or shares without also asking for the exact number of\n  total shares (or, equivalently, the exact percentage of the company those shares\n  represent). It\u2019s quite common for some companies to give offers of stock or options and\n  tell you only the number of shares.\n  Without the percentage, the number of shares is meaningless.\n  Not telling you is a deeply unfair practice.\n  A company that refuses to tell you even when you\u2019re ready to sign an offer is likely\n  giving you a very poor deal.\n- \ud83d\udd38 If you\u2019re looking at an offer, work out whether you can and should early exercise, and\n  what the cost to exercise and tax will be, before accepting the offer.\n- \u2757 If you join a startup right as it raises a new round, and don\u2019t have the chance to\n  exercise right away, they may potentially issue you the options with the low strike price,\n  but the 409A valuation of the stock will have gone up.\n  This means you won\u2019t be able to early exercise without a large tax bill.\n  In fact, it might not be financially feasible for you to exercise at all.\n- \u2757 Vesting starts on a vesting commencement date.\n  Sometimes stock option paperwork won\u2019t reach you for weeks or months after you join a\n  company, since it needs to be written by the lawyers and approved by the board of\n  directors. In your negotiations, do make sure the vesting commencement date will reflect\n  the true start date of when you joined the company, not the time at which the stock option\n  is granted.\n- \ud83d\udd38 The offer letter is not the actual grant of your equity.\n  After you sign your offer letter, ensure the company delivers you your actual equity grant\n  documents within a few weeks.\n  It is not uncommon for early-stage startups to be sloppy with their equity granting.\n  If they take too long to send your grant documents, the fair market value (and exercise\n  price) of the equity could rise in the time you\u2019re waiting, which is money lost for you.\n- \ud83d\udd38 If you\u2019re going to early exercise, consider it like any investment.\n  Don\u2019t believe every projection about the value of the company you hear.\n  Founders will tell you the best-case scenario.\n  Remember, most startups fail.\n  Do your research and ask others\u2019 opinions about likely outcomes for the company.\n- \u2757 It may not be common, but some companies retain a right to repurchase (buy back) vested\n  shares. It\u2019s simple enough to ask, \u201cDoes the company have any repurchase right to *vested*\n  shares?\u201d (Note repurchasing *unvested* shares that were purchased via early exercise is\n  different, and helps you.)\n  If you don\u2019t want to ask, the fair market value repurchase right should be included in the\n  documents you are being asked to sign or acknowledge that you have read and understood.\n  (Skype\u2019s\n  [controversy](https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/26/skypes-worthless-employee-stock-option-plan-heres-why-they-did-it/)\n  related to repurchasing has some startup employees\n  [looking out](https://www.quora.com/Which-valley-startups-have-a-Skype-like-repurchase-right)\n  for companies with similar plans.)\n  You might find a repurchase right for vested shares in the Stock Plan itself, the Stock\n  Option Agreement, the Exercise Agreement, the bylaws, the certificate of incorporation, or\n  any other stockholder agreement.\n\n## Documents and Agreements\n\nThis section covers a few kinds of documents you\u2019re likely to see as you negotiate a job\noffer and sign on to a company.\nIt\u2019s not exhaustive, as titles and details vary.\n\n- When you are considering your offer, make sure you have all of the documents you need from\n  the company:\n  - Your [\ud83d\udce5offer letter](https://www.upcounsel.com/employee-offer-letter), which will detail\n    salary, benefits, and equity compensation.\n  - An\n    [\ud83d\udce5Employee Innovations Agreement](https://recruit.smashfly.com/SmashFlyMedia/Docs/12250/12250_168_United%20States%20-%20EIPIA%20English%20%28Rev%2014%20FEBRUARY%202017%29%202%20pages.pdf),\n    Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement, or similar, concerning\n    intellectual property.\n- If you have equity compensation, at some point\u2014possibly weeks or months after you\u2019ve\n  joined\u2014you should get a Summary of Stock Grant, Notice of Stock Option Grant, or similar\n  document, detailing your grant of stock or options, along with all details such as number\n  of shares, type of options, grant date, vesting commencement date, and vesting schedule.\n  It will come with several other documents, which may be exhibits to that agreement:\n  - [\ud83d\udce5Stock Option Agreement](https://www.upcounsel.com/stock-option-agreement)\n  - [\ud83d\udce5Stock Plan](https://www.upcounsel.com/equity-incentive-plan) (sometimes called a Stock\n    Option Plan, or Stock Award Plan, or Equity Incentive Plan)\n  - [\ud83d\udce5Code Section 409A Waiver and Release](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/code-section-409a-waiver-and-release)\n    (sometimes part of the Stock Option Agreement)\n- If you are exercising your options, you should also see paperwork to assist with that\n  purchase:\n  - [\ud83d\udce5Exercise Agreement](https://www.upcounsel.com/option-exercise-agreement)\n  - Instructions and template for early exercise and\n    [\ud83d\udce583(b) election](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-12-29.pdf), if applicable\n- End of year tax documents\n\n  - You should receive a form\n    [\ud83d\udce53921 or 3922](https://www.irs.gov/uac/form-3921-exercise-of-an-incentive-stock-option-under-section-422-b)\n    from your company if you exercised ISO options during the year.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nThe resources here are a small subset of the full set of resources cited in the Guide to\nEquity Compensation, selected for their breadth, notability, or depth on specific issues.\n\n### General Resources\n\n- Mark P.
