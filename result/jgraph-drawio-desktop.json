        "readme": "About\n----- \n\n**drawio-desktop** is a diagramming and whiteboarding desktop app based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) that wraps the [core draw.io editor](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).\n\nDownload built binaries from the [releases section](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases).\n\n**Can I use this app for free?** Yes, under the apache 2.0 license. If you don't change the code and accept it is provided \"as-is\", you can use it for any purpose.\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\ndraw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript.\n\nNo diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. This means certain functionality for which we do not have a JavaScript implementation do not work in the Desktop build, namely .vsd and Gliffy import.\n\nSecurity and isolating the app are the primarily objectives of draw.io desktop. If you ask for anything that involves external connections enabled in the app by default, the answer will be no.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nSupport is provided on a reasonable business constraints basis, but without anything contractually binding. All support is provided via this repo. There is no private ticketing support.\n\nPurchasing draw.io for Confluence or Jira does not entitle you to commercial support for draw.io desktop. The draw.io integrations for Atlassian are sold by Seibert Media, they have no involvement with this project.\n\nDeveloping\n----------\n\n**draw.io** is a git submodule of **drawio-desktop**. To get both you need to clone recursively:\n\n`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop.git`\n\nTo run this:\n1. `npm install` (in the root directory of this repo)\n2. export DRAWIO_ENV=dev if you want to develop/debug in dev mode.\n3. `npm start` _in the root directory of this repo_ runs the app. For debugging, use `npm start --enable-logging`.\n\nNote: If a symlink is used to refer to drawio repo (instead of the submodule), then symlink the `node_modules` directory inside `drawio/src/main/webapp` also.\n\nTo release:\n1. Update the draw.io sub-module and push the change. Add version tag before pushing to origin.\n2. Wait for the builds to complete (https://travis-ci.org/jgraph/drawio-desktop and https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidjgraph/drawio-desktop)\n3. Go to https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases, edit the preview release.\n4. Download the windows exe and windows portable, sign them using `signtool sign /a /tr http://rfc3161timestamp.globalsign.com/advanced /td SHA256 c:/path/to/your/file.exe`\n5. Re-upload signed file as `draw.io-windows-installer-x.y.z.exe` and `draw.io-windows-no-installer-x.y.z.exe`\n6. Add release notes\n7. Publish release\n\n*Note*: In Windows release, when using both x64 and is32 as arch, the result is one big file with both archs. This is why we split them.\n\nLocal Storage and Session Storage is stored in the AppData folder:\n\n- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/draw.io`\n- Windows: `C:\\Users\\<USER-NAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\draw.io\\`\n\nNot open-contribution\n---------------------\n\ndraw.io is closed to contributions.\n\nThe level of complexity of this project means that even simple changes \ncan break a _lot_ of other moving parts. The amount of testing required \nis far more than it first seems. If we were to receive a PR, we'd have \nto basically throw it away and write it how we want it to be implemented.\n\nWe are grateful for community involvement, bug reports, & feature requests. We do\nnot wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, we've\nmade the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for \nthe long term viability of the project.\n",
