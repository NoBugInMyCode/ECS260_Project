Not using React? <a href='#standalone-player'>No problem.</a>\n</p>\n\n---\n\n> Using Next.js and need to handle video upload/processing? Check out [next-video](https://github.com/muxinc/next-video).\n\n### \u2728 The future of ReactPlayer\n\nMaintenance of ReactPlayer is being taken over by [Mux](https://www.mux.com). Mux is a [video api](https://www.mux.com/video-api) for developers. The team at Mux have worked on many highly respected projects and are committed to improving video tooling for developers.\n\nReactPlayer will remain open source, but with a higher rate of fixes and releases over time. Thanks to everyone in the community for your ongoing support.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-player # or yarn add react-player\n```\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactPlayer from 'react-player'\n\n// Render a YouTube video player\n<ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXb3EKWsInQ' />\n```\n\nBy default, ReactPlayer supports [many different types](#supported-media) of `url`. If you only ever use one type, use imports such as `react-player/youtube` to reduce your bundle size. See [config keys](#config-prop) for all player keys.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactPlayer from 'react-player/youtube'\n\n// Only loads the YouTube player\n<ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXb3EKWsInQ' />\n```\n\nIf your build system supports `import()` statements, use `react-player/lazy` to lazy load the appropriate player for the `url` you pass in. This adds several `reactPlayer` chunks to your output, but reduces your main bundle size.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactPlayer from 'react-player/lazy'\n\n// Lazy load the YouTube player\n<ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysz5S6PUM-U' />\n```\n\nDemo page: [`https://cookpete.github.io/react-player`](https://cookpete.github.io/react-player)\n\nThe component parses a URL and loads in the appropriate markup and external SDKs to play media from [various sources](#supported-media). [Props](#props) can be passed in to control playback and react to events such as buffering or media ending. See [the demo source](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player/blob/master/examples/react/src/App.js) for a full example.\n\nFor platforms without direct use of `npm` modules, a minified version of `ReactPlayer` is located in `dist` after installing. To generate this file yourself, checkout the repo and run `npm run build:dist`.\n\n#### Autoplay\n\nAs of Chrome 66, [videos must be `muted` in order to play automatically](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17150870/google-chrome-autoplay-videos-sound-mute-update). Some players, like Facebook, cannot be unmuted until the user interacts with the video, so you may want to enable `controls` to allow users to unmute videos themselves. Please set `muted={true}`.\n\n### Props\n\nProp | Description | Default\n---- | ----------- | -------\n`url` | The url of a video or song to play<br/>&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Can be an [array](#multiple-sources-and-tracks) or [`MediaStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) object\n`playing` | Set to `true` or `false` to pause or play the media | `false`\n`loop` | Set to `true` or `false` to loop the media | `false`\n`controls` | Set to `true` or `false` to display native player controls.<br/>&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;For Vimeo videos, hiding controls must be enabled by the video owner. | `false`\n`light` | Set to `true` to show just the video thumbnail, which loads the full player on click<br />&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Pass in an image URL to override the preview image | `false`\n`volume` | Set the volume of the player, between `0` and `1`<br/>&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;`null` uses default volume on all players [`#357`](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player/issues/357) | `null`\n`muted` | Mutes the player<br/>&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Only works if `volume` is set | `false`\n`playbackRate` | Set the playback rate of the player<br />&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Only supported by YouTube, Wistia, and file paths | `1`\n`width` | Set the width of the player | `640px`\n`height` | Set the height of the player | `360px`\n`style` | Add [inline styles](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html) to the root element | `{}`\n`progressInterval` | The time between `onProgress` callbacks, in milliseconds | `1000`\n`playsinline` | Applies the `playsinline` attribute where supported | `false`\n`pip` | Set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable [picture-in-picture mode](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/watch-video-using-picture-in-picture)<br/>&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Only available when playing file URLs in [certain browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=picture-in-picture) | `false`\n`stopOnUnmount` | If you are using `pip` you may want to use `stopOnUnmount={false}` to continue playing in picture-in-picture mode even after ReactPlayer unmounts | `true`\n`fallback` | Element or component to use as a fallback if you are using lazy loading | `null`\n`wrapper` | Element or component to use as the container element | `div`\n`playIcon` | Element or component to use as the play icon in light mode\n`previewTabIndex` | Set the tab index to be used on light mode | 0\n`config` | Override options for the various players, see [config prop](#config-prop)\n\n#### Callback props\n\nCallback props take a function that gets fired on various player events:\n\nProp | Description\n---- | -----------\n`onReady` | Called when media is loaded and ready to play.

This does *not* detect media that is unplayable due to privacy settings, streaming permissions, etc. In that case, the `onError` prop will be invoked after attempting to play. Any URL that does not match any patterns will fall back to a native HTML5 media player.\n`ReactPlayer.canEnablePiP(url)` | Determine if a URL can be played in [picture-in-picture mode](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/watch-video-using-picture-in-picture)\n`ReactPlayer.addCustomPlayer(CustomPlayer)` | Add a custom player. See [Adding custom players](#adding-custom-players)\n`ReactPlayer.removeCustomPlayers()` | Remove any players that have been added using `addCustomPlayer()`\n\n#### Instance Methods\n\nUse [`ref`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) to call instance methods on the player. See [the demo app](examples/react/src/App.js) for an example of this.\n\nMethod | Description\n------ | -----------\n`seekTo(amount, type)` | Seek to the given number of seconds, or fraction if `amount` is between `0` and `1`<br />&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;`type` parameter lets you specify `'seconds'` or `'fraction'` to override default behaviour\n`getCurrentTime()` | Returns the number of seconds that have been played<br />&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Returns `null` if unavailable\n`getSecondsLoaded()` | Returns the number of seconds that have been loaded<br />&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Returns `null` if unavailable or unsupported\n`getDuration()` | Returns the duration (in seconds) of the currently playing media<br />&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Returns `null` if duration is unavailable\n`getInternalPlayer()` | Returns the internal player of whatever is currently playing<br />&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;eg the [YouTube player instance](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Loading_a_Video_Player), or the [`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) element when playing a video file<br />&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Use `getInternalPlayer('hls')` to get the [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js) player<br />&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Use `getInternalPlayer('dash')` to get the [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) player<br />&nbsp; \u25e6 &nbsp;Returns `null` if the internal player is unavailable\n`showPreview()` | When using `light` mode, returns to the preview overlay\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\n#### Light player\n\nThe `light` prop will render a video thumbnail with simple play icon, and only load the full player once a user has interacted with the image. [Noembed](https://noembed.com) is used to fetch thumbnails for a video URL. Note that automatic thumbnail fetching for Facebook, Wistia, Mixcloud and file URLs are not supported, and ongoing support for other URLs is not guaranteed.\n\nIf you want to pass in your own thumbnail to use, set `light` to the image URL rather than `true`.\n\nYou can also pass a component through the `light` prop:\n\n```jsx\n<ReactPlayer light={<img src='https://example.com/thumbnail.png' alt='Thumbnail' />} />\n```\n\nThe styles for the preview image and play icon can be overridden by targeting the CSS classes `react-player__preview`, `react-player__shadow` and `react-player__play-icon`.\n\n#### Responsive player\n\nSet `width` and `height` to `100%` and wrap the player in a [fixed aspect ratio box](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes) to get a responsive player:\n\n```js\nclass ResponsivePlayer extends Component {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <div className='player-wrapper'>\n        <ReactPlayer\n          className='react-player'\n          url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysz5S6PUM-U'\n          width='100%'\n          height='100%'\n        />\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```css\n.player-wrapper {\n  position: relative;\n  padding-top: 56.25%; /* Player ratio: 100 / (1280 / 720) */\n}\n\n.react-player {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n}\n```\n\nSee [`jsFiddle` example](https://jsfiddle.net/e6w3rtj1/)\n\n#### SDK Overrides\n\nYou can use your own version of any player SDK, assuming the correct `window` global is set before the player mounts. For example, to use a local version of [`hls.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/hls.js), add `<script src='/path/hls.js'></script>` to your app. If `window.Hls` is available when ReactPlayer mounts, it will use that instead of loading `hls.js` from `cdnjs`. See [#605](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player/issues/605#issuecomment-492561909) for more information.\n\n#### Standalone player\n\nIf you aren\u2019t using React, you can still render a player using the standalone library:\n\n```html\n<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-player/dist/ReactPlayer.standalone.js'></script>\n<script>\n  const container = document.getElementById('container')\n  const url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d46Azg3Pm4c'\n\n  renderReactPlayer(container, { url, playing: true })\n\n  function pausePlayer () {\n    renderReactPlayer(container, { url, playing: false })\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nSee [`jsFiddle` example](https://jsfiddle.net/krkcvx9s/)\n\n#### Adding custom players\n\nIf you have your own player that is compatible with ReactPlayer\u2019s internal architecture, you can add it using `addCustomPlayer`:\n\n```javascript\nimport YourOwnPlayer from './somewhere';\nReactPlayer.addCustomPlayer(YourOwnPlayer);\n```\n\nUse `removeCustomPlayers` to clear all custom players:\n\n```javascript\nReactPlayer.removeCustomPlayers();\n```\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that custom players keep up with any internal changes to ReactPlayer in later versions.\n\n#### Mobile considerations\n\nDue to various restrictions, `ReactPlayer` is not guaranteed to function properly on mobile devices. The [YouTube player documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference), for example, explains that [certain mobile browsers require user interaction](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Mobile_considerations) before playing:\n\n> The HTML5 `<video>` element, in certain mobile browsers (such as Chrome and Safari), only allows playback to take place if it\u2019s initiated by a user interaction (such as tapping on the player).\n\n#### Multiple Sources and Tracks\n\nPassing an array of YouTube URLs to the `url` prop will load them as an untitled playlist.\n\n```jsx\n<ReactPlayer\n  url={[\n    'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUFJJNQGwhk',\n    'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNgP6d9HraI'\n  ]}\n/>\n```\n\nWhen playing file paths, an array of sources can be passed to the `url` prop to render multiple `<source>` tags.\n\n```jsx\n<ReactPlayer playing url={['foo.webm', 'foo.ogg']} />\n```\n\nYou can also specify a `type` for each source by using objects with `src` and `type` properties.\n\n```jsx\n<ReactPlayer\n  playing\n  url={[\n    {src: 'foo.webm', type: 'video/webm'},\n    {src: 'foo.ogg', type: 'video/ogg'}\n  ]}\n/>\n```\n\n[`<track>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track) elements for subtitles can be added using `config.file`:\n\n```jsx\n<ReactPlayer\n  playing\n  url='foo.webm'\n  config={{ file: {\n    tracks: [\n      {kind: 'subtitles', src: 'subs/subtitles.en.vtt', srcLang: 'en', default: true},\n      {kind: 'subtitles', src: 'subs/subtitles.ja.vtt', srcLang: 'ja'},\n      {kind: 'subtitles', src: 'subs/subtitles.de.vtt', srcLang: 'de'}\n    ]\n  }}}\n/>\n```\n\n### Migrating to `v2.0`\n\nReactPlayer `v2.0` changes single player imports and adds lazy loading players. Support for `preload` has also been removed, plus some other changes. See [`MIGRATING.md`](/MIGRATING.md) for information.\n\n### Supported media\n\n* YouTube videos use the [YouTube iFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference)\n* Facebook videos use the [Facebook Embedded Video Player API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/embedded-video-player/api)\n* SoundCloud tracks use the [SoundCloud Widget API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/html5-widget)\n* Streamable videos use [`Player.js`](https://github.com/embedly/player.js)\n* Vimeo videos use the [Vimeo Player API](https://developer.vimeo.com/player/sdk)\n* Mux videos use the [`<mux-player>`](https://github.com/muxinc/elements/blob/main/packages/mux-player/README.md) element\n* Wistia videos use the [Wistia Player API](https://wistia.com/doc/player-api)\n* Twitch videos use the [Twitch Interactive Frames API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed#interactive-frames-for-live-streams-and-vods)\n* DailyMotion videos use the [DailyMotion Player API](https://developer.dailymotion.com/player)\n* Vidyard videos use the [Vidyard Player API](https://knowledge.vidyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019034753-Using-the-Vidyard-Player-API)\n* Kaltura's `react-player` implementation uses the embed.ly [`Player.js`](https://github.com/embedly/player.js) API but Kaltura specific APIs are also available, see [Kaltura Player API](http://player.kaltura.com/docs/index.php?path=kwidget)\n* [Supported file types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats) are playing using [`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) or [`<audio>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) elements\n  * HLS streams are played using [`hls.js`](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js)\n  * DASH streams are played using [`dash.js`](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js)\n\n### Contributing\n\nSee the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before creating a pull request.\n\n### Thanks\n\n- Thanks to anyone who has [contributed](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player/graphs/contributors).\n- Big thanks to my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/cookpete) supporters!\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td align='center'>\n      <a href='https://the100.tv'><img src='https://the100.tv/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fthe100-tv-alone-2k.2e7c7877.png&w=384&q=75' width='120' /><br />Jackson Doherty</a>\n    </td>\n    <td align='center'>\n      <a href='https://github.com/jaxomlotus'><img src='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/485706?s=120&v=4' /><br />Joseph Fung</a>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n",
