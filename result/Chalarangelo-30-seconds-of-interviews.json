Stateless components can be either functional or class components. Stateless functional components are easier to maintain and test since they are guaranteed to produce the same output given the same props. Stateless functional components should be preferred when lifecycle hooks don't need to be used.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Stateless components are independent of their state.\n* Stateless components can be either class or functional components.\n* Stateless functional components avoid the `this` keyword altogether.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the difference between the equality operators `==` and `===`?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nTriple equals (`===`) checks for strict equality, which means both the type and value must be the same. Double equals (`==`) on the other hand first performs type coercion so that both operands are of the same type and then applies strict comparison.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Whenever possible, use triple equals to test equality because loose equality `==` can have unintuitive results.\n* Type coercion means the values are converted into the same type.\n* Mention of falsy values and their comparison.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [MDN docs for comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the difference between an element and a component in React?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nAn element is a plain JavaScript object that represents a DOM node or component. Elements are pure and never mutated, and are cheap to create.\n\nA component is a function or class. Components can have state and take props as input and return an element tree as output (although they can represent generic containers or wrappers and don't necessarily have to emit DOM). Components can initiate side effects in lifecycle methods (e.g. AJAX requests, DOM mutations, interfacing with 3rd party libraries) and may be expensive to create.\n\n```js\nconst Component = () => \"Hello\"\nconst componentElement = <Component />\nconst domNodeElement = <div />\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Elements are immutable, plain objects that describe the DOM nodes or components you want to render.\n* Components can be either classes or functions, that take props as an input and return an element tree as the output.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)\n* [React docs on Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is a stateful component in React?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nA stateful component is a component whose behavior depends on its state.

In addition, nested objects are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object (Date, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the object.\n\nOther alternatives include:\n\n* `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` can be used to deep-clone a simple object, but it is CPU-intensive and only accepts valid JSON (therefore it strips functions and does not allow circular references).\n* `Object.assign({}, obj)` is another alternative.\n* `Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) => (acc[key] = obj[key], acc), {})` is another more verbose alternative that shows the concept in greater depth.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* JavaScript passes objects by reference, meaning that nested objects get their references copied, instead of their values.\n* The same method can be used to merge two objects.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [MDN docs for Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)\n* [Clone an object in vanilla JS](http://voidcanvas.com/clone-an-object-in-vanilla-js-in-depth/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nSynchronous means each operation must wait for the previous one to complete.\n\nAsynchronous means an operation can occur while another operation is still being processed.\n\nIn JavaScript, all code is synchronous due to the single-threaded nature of it. However, asynchronous operations not part of the program (such as `XMLHttpRequest` or `setTimeout`) are processed outside of the main thread because they are controlled by native code (browser APIs), but callbacks part of the program will still be executed synchronously.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an \"event loop\".\n* Functions like `alert` block the main thread so that no user input is registered until the user closes it.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### How do you compare two objects in JavaScript?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nEven though two different objects can have the same properties with equal values, they are not considered equal when compared using `==` or `===`. This is because they are being compared by their reference (location in memory), unlike primitive values which are compared by value.\n\nIn order to test if two objects are equal in structure, a helper function is required. It will\niterate through the own properties of each object to test if they have the same values, including nested objects.\nOptionally, the prototypes of the objects may also be tested for equivalence by passing `true` as the 3rd argument.\n\nNote: this technique does not attempt to test equivalence of data structures other than\nplain objects, arrays, functions, dates and primitive values.\n\n```js\nfunction isDeepEqual(obj1, obj2, testPrototypes = false) {\n  if (obj1 === obj2) {\n    return true\n  }\n\n  if (typeof obj1 === \"function\" && typeof obj2 === \"function\") {\n    return obj1.toString() === obj2.toString()\n  }\n\n  if (obj1 instanceof Date && obj2 instanceof Date) {\n    return obj1.getTime() === obj2.getTime()\n  }\n\n  if (\n    Object.prototype.toString.call(obj1) !==\n      Object.prototype.toString.call(obj2) ||\n    typeof obj1 !== \"object\"\n  ) {\n    return false\n  }\n\n  const prototypesAreEqual = testPrototypes\n    ? isDeepEqual(\n        Object.getPrototypeOf(obj1),\n        Object.getPrototypeOf(obj2),\n        true\n      )\n    : true\n\n  const obj1Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1)\n  const obj2Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2)\n\n  return (\n    obj1Props.length === obj2Props.length &&\n    prototypesAreEqual &&\n    obj1Props.every(prop => isDeepEqual(obj1[prop], obj2[prop]))\n  )\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Primitives like strings and numbers are compared by their value\n* Objects on the other hand are compared by their reference (location in memory)\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Object Equality in JavaScript](http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/object-equality-in-javascript.html)\n* [Deep comparison between two values](https://30secondsofcode.org/object#equals)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is a cross-site scripting attack (XSS) and how do you prevent it?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nXSS refers to client-side code injection where the attacker injects malicious scripts into a legitimate website or web application. This is often achieved when the application does not validate user input and freely injects dynamic HTML content.\n\nFor example, a comment system will be at risk if it does not validate or escape user input. If the comment contains unescaped HTML, the comment can inject a `<script>` tag into the website that other users will execute against their knowledge.\n\n* The malicious script has access to cookies which are often used to store session tokens. If an attacker can obtain a user\u2019s session cookie, they can impersonate the user.\n* The script can arbitrarily manipulate the DOM of the page the script is executing in, allowing the attacker to insert pieces of content that appear to be a real part of the website.\n* The script can use AJAX to send HTTP requests with arbitrary content to arbitrary destinations.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* On the client, using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` prevents the browser from running the string through the HTML parser which would execute scripts in it.\n* On the server, escaping HTML tags will prevent the browser from parsing the user input as actual HTML and therefore won't execute the script.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Cross-Site Scripting Attack (XSS)](https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/cross-site-scripting/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is CORS?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to grant a browser permission to access resources from a server at an origin different from the website origin.\n\nAn example of a cross-origin request is a web application served from `http://mydomain.com` that uses AJAX to make a request for `http://yourdomain.com`.\n\nFor security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated by JavaScript. `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch` follow the same-origin policy, meaning a web application using those APIs can only request HTTP resources from the same origin the application was accessed, unless the response from the other origin includes the correct CORS headers.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* CORS behavior is not an error, \u200ait\u2019s a security mechanism to protect users.\n* CORS is designed to prevent a malicious website that a user may unintentionally visit from making a request to a legitimate website to read their personal data or perform actions against their will.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [MDN docs for CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the DOM?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nThe DOM (Document Object Model) is a cross-platform API that treats HTML and XML documents as a tree structure consisting of nodes. These nodes (such as elements and text nodes) are objects that can be programmatically manipulated and any visible changes made to them are reflected live in the document. In a browser, this API is available to JavaScript where DOM nodes can be manipulated to change their styles, contents, placement in the document, or interacted with through event listeners.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.\n* The DOM is constructed progressively in the browser as a page loads, which is why scripts are often placed at the bottom of a page, in the `<head>` with a `defer` attribute, or inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. Scripts that manipulate DOM nodes should be run after the DOM has been constructed to avoid errors.\n* `document.getElementById()` and `document.querySelector()` are common functions for selecting DOM nodes.\n* Setting the `innerHTML` property to a new value runs the string through the HTML parser, offering an easy way to append dynamic HTML content to a node.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [MDN docs for DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Create a standalone function `bind` that is functionally equivalent to the method `Function.prototype.bind`.\n\n```js\nfunction example() {\n  console.log(this)\n}\nconst boundExample = bind(example, { a: true })\nboundExample.call({ b: true }) // logs { a: true }\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nReturn a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments by gathering them with the rest `...` operator.

In non-strict mode, if the variable has not yet been declared, it will assign the variable as a property of the global object (`window` in browsers). In strict mode, it will throw an error to prevent unwanted global variables from being created.\n\n##### var\n\n`var` was the default statement to declare a variable until ES2015. It creates a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned and redeclared. However, due to its lack of block scoping, it can cause issues if the variable is being reused in a loop that contains an asynchronous callback because the variable will continue to exist outside of the block scope.\n\nBelow, by the time the the `setTimeout` callback executes, the loop has already finished and the `i` variable is `10`, so all ten callbacks reference the same variable available in the function scope.\n\n```js\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    // logs `10` ten times\n    console.log(i)\n  })\n}\n\n/* Solutions with `var` */\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  // Passed as an argument will use the value as-is in\n  // that point in time\n  setTimeout(console.log, 0, i)\n}\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  // Create a new function scope that will use the value\n  // as-is in that point in time\n  ;(i => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      console.log(i)\n    })\n  })(i)\n}\n```\n\n##### let\n\n`let` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred way to declare variables that will be reassigned later. Trying to redeclare a variable again will throw an error. It is block-scoped so that using it in a loop will keep it scoped to the iteration.\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n    console.log(i)\n  })\n}\n```\n\n##### const\n\n`const` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred default way to declare all variables if they won't be reassigned later, even for objects that will be mutated (as long as the reference to the object does not change). It is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.\n\n```js\nconst myObject = {}\nmyObject.prop = \"hello!\" // No error\nmyObject = \"hello\" // Error\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* All declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope.\n* However, with `let` and `const` there is a concept called the temporal dead zone (TDZ). While the declarations are still hoisted, there is a period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed.\n* Show a common issue with using `var` and how `let` can solve it, as well as a solution that keeps `var`.\n* `var` should be avoided whenever possible and prefer `const` as the default declaration statement for all variables unless they will be reassigned later, then use `let` if so.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [`let` vs `const`](https://wesbos.com/let-vs-const/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is event delegation and why is it useful? Can you show an example of how to use it?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nEvent delegation is a technique of delegating events to a single common ancestor. Due to event bubbling, events \"bubble\" up the DOM tree by executing any handlers progressively on each ancestor element up to the root that may be listening to it.\n\nDOM events provide useful information about the element that initiated the event via `Event.target`. This allows the parent element to handle behavior as though the target element was listening to the event, rather than all children of the parent or the parent itself.\n\nThis provides two main benefits:\n\n* It increases performance and reduces memory consumption by only needing to register a single event listener to handle potentially thousands of elements.\n* If elements are dynamically added to the parent, there is no need to register new event listeners for them.\n\nInstead of:\n\n```js\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"button\").forEach(button => {\n  button.addEventListener(\"click\", handleButtonClick)\n})\n```\n\nEvent delegation involves using a condition to ensure the child target matches our desired element:\n\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener(\"click\", e => {\n  if (e.target.closest(\"button\")) {\n    handleButtonClick()\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* The difference between event bubbling and capturing\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Event Delegation](https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState`?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nThe callback function is invoked when `setState` has finished and the component gets rendered.

A third one is both together, referred to as an expression statement. They are roughly summarized as:\n\n* **Expression**: produces a value\n* **Statement**: performs an action\n* **Expression statement**: produces a value and performs an action\n\nA general rule of thumb:\n\n> If you can print it or assign it to a variable, it\u2019s an expression. If you can\u2019t, it\u2019s a statement.\n\n##### Statements\n\n```js\nlet x = 0\n\nfunction declaration() {}\n\nif (true) {\n}\n```\n\nStatements appear as instructions that do something but don't produce values.\n\n```js\n// Assign `x` to the absolute value of `y`.\nvar x\nif (y >= 0) {\n  x = y\n} else {\n  x = -y\n}\n```\n\nThe only expression in the above code is `y >= 0` which produces a value, either `true` or `false`. A value is not produced by other parts of the code.\n\n##### Expressions\n\nExpressions produce a value. They can be passed around to functions because the interpreter replaces them with the value they resolve to.\n\n```js\n5 + 5 // => 10\n\nlastCharacter(\"input\") // => \"t\"\n\ntrue === true // => true\n```\n\n##### Expression statements\n\nThere is an equivalent version of the set of statements used before as an expression using the conditional operator:\n\n```js\n// Assign `x` as the absolute value of `y`.\nvar x = y >= 0 ? y : -y\n```\n\nThis is both an expression and a statement, because we are declaring a variable `x` (statement) as an evaluation (expression).\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Function declarations vs function expressions\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [What is the difference between a statement and an expression?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12703214/javascript-difference-between-a-statement-and-an-expression)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nA value is either truthy or falsy depending on how it is evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy means false-like and truthy means true-like. Essentially, they are values that are coerced to `true` or `false` when performing certain operations.\n\nThere are 6 falsy values in JavaScript. They are:\n\n* `false`\n* `undefined`\n* `null`\n* `\"\"` (empty string)\n* `NaN`\n* `0` (both `+0` and `-0`)\n\nEvery other value is considered truthy.\n\nA value's truthiness can be examined by passing it into the `Boolean` function.\n\n```js\nBoolean(\"\") // false\nBoolean([]) // true\n```\n\nThere is a shortcut for this using the logical NOT `!` operator.

This is known as short-circuit evaluation.\n\nThis also works for logical AND.\n\n```js\nfalse && true\n```\n\nThis means you can have an expression that throws an error if evaluated, and it won't cause issues.\n\n```js\ntrue || nonexistentFunction()\nfalse && nonexistentFunction()\n```\n\nThis remains true for multiple operations because of left-to-right evaluation.\n\n```js\ntrue || nonexistentFunction() || window.nothing.wouldThrowError\ntrue || window.nothing.wouldThrowError\ntrue\n```\n\nA common use case for this behavior is setting default values. If the first operand is falsy the second operand will be evaluated.\n\n```js\nconst options = {}\nconst setting = options.setting || \"default\"\nsetting // \"default\"\n```\n\nAnother common use case is only evaluating an expression if the first operand is truthy.\n\n```js\n// Instead of:\naddEventListener(\"click\", e => {\n  if (e.target.closest(\"button\")) {\n    handleButtonClick(e)\n  }\n})\n\n// You can take advantage of short-circuit evaluation:\naddEventListener(\n  \"click\",\n  e => e.target.closest(\"button\") && handleButtonClick(e)\n)\n```\n\nIn the above case, if `e.target` is not or does not contain an element matching the `\"button\"` selector, the function will not be called.

However, if there is an error, you create an Error object, which then becomes the callback's only parameter. The callback function allows a user to easily know whether or not an error occurred.\n\nThis practice is also called the _Node.js error convention_, and this kind of callback implementations are called _error-first callbacks_.\n\n```js\nvar isTrue = function(value, callback) {\n  if (value === true) {\n    callback(null, \"Value was true.\")\n  } else {\n    callback(new Error(\"Value is not true!\"))\n  }\n}\n\nvar callback = function(error, retval) {\n  if (error) {\n    console.log(error)\n    return\n  }\n  console.log(retval)\n}\n\nisTrue(false, callback)\nisTrue(true, callback)\n\n/*\n  { stack: [Getter/Setter],\n    arguments: undefined,\n    type: undefined,\n    message: 'Value is not true!' }\n  Value was true.\n*/\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* This is just a convention.

Can you show an example using one?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nCallbacks are functions passed as an argument to another function to be executed once an event has occurred or a certain task is complete, often used in asynchronous code. Callback functions are invoked later by a piece of code but can be declared on initialization without being invoked.\n\nAs an example, event listeners are asynchronous callbacks that are only executed when a specific event occurs.\n\n```js\nfunction onClick() {\n  console.log(\"The user clicked on the page.\")\n}\ndocument.addEventListener(\"click\", onClick)\n```\n\nHowever, callbacks can also be synchronous. The following `map` function takes a callback function that is invoked synchronously for each iteration of the loop (array element).\n\n```js\nconst map = (arr, callback) => {\n  const result = []\n  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n    result.push(callback(arr[i], i))\n  }\n  return result\n}\nmap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n => n * 2) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Functions are first-class objects in JavaScript\n* Callbacks vs Promises\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [MDN docs for callbacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nIn JavaScript, two values discretely represent nothing - `undefined` and `null`. The concrete difference between them is that `null` is explicit, while `undefined` is implicit. When a property does not exist or a variable has not been given a value, the value is `undefined`. `null` is set as the value to explicitly indicate \u201cno value\u201d. In essence, `undefined` is used when the nothing is not known, and `null` is used when the nothing is known.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* `typeof undefined` evaluates to `\"undefined\"`.\n* `typeof null` evaluates `\"object\"`.

The `new` operator must be used before invoking the constructor or the global object will be mutated.\n\n```js\nfunction Person(name, age) {\n  this.name = name\n  this.age = age\n}\nPerson.prototype.birthday = function() {\n  this.age++\n}\nconst person1 = new Person(\"John\", 50)\nconst person2 = new Person(\"Sally\", 20)\nperson1.birthday() // person1.age === 51\nperson2.birthday() // person2.age === 21\n```\n\n##### Factory function\n\nCreates a new object similar to a constructor, but can store private data using a closure. There is also no need to use `new` before invoking the function or the `this` keyword. Factory functions usually discard the idea of prototypes and keep all properties and methods as own properties of the object.\n\n```js\nconst createPerson = (name, age) => {\n  const birthday = () => person.age++\n  const person = { name, age, birthday }\n  return person\n}\nconst person = createPerson(\"John\", 50)\nperson.birthday() // person.age === 51\n```\n\n##### `Object.create()`\n\nSets the prototype of the newly created object.\n\n```js\nconst personProto = {\n  birthday() {\n    this.age++\n  }\n}\nconst person = Object.create(personProto)\nperson.age = 50\nperson.birthday() // person.age === 51\n```\n\nA second argument can also be supplied to `Object.create()` which acts as a descriptor for the new properties to be defined.\n\n```js\nObject.create(personProto, {\n  age: {\n    value: 50,\n    writable: true,\n    enumerable: true\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Prototypes are objects that other objects inherit properties and methods from.\n* Factory functions offer private properties and methods through a closure but increase memory usage as a tradeoff, while classes do not have private properties or methods but reduce memory impact by reusing a single prototype object.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nParameters are the variable names of the function definition, while arguments are the values given to a function when it is invoked.\n\n```js\nfunction myFunction(parameter1, parameter2) {\n  console.log(arguments[0]) // \"argument1\"\n}\nmyFunction(\"argument1\", \"argument2\")\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* `arguments` is an array-like object containing information about the arguments supplied to an invoked function.\n* `myFunction.length` describes the arity of a function (how many parameters it has, regardless of how many arguments it is supplied).\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Does JavaScript pass by value or by reference?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nJavaScript always passes by value.

This means operations performed on objects can change the original reference in some way, while operations performed on a primitive value cannot change the original value.\n\nAll `String.prototype` methods do not have an effect on the original string and return a new string. On the other hand, while some methods of `Array.prototype` do not mutate the original array reference and produce a fresh array, some cause mutations.\n\n```js\nconst myString = \"hello!\"\nmyString.replace(\"!\", \"\") // returns a new string, cannot mutate the original value\n\nconst originalArray = [1, 2, 3]\noriginalArray.push(4) // mutates originalArray, now [1, 2, 3, 4]\noriginalArray.concat(4) // returns a new array, does not mutate the original\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* List of mutating and non-mutating array methods\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Mutating vs non-mutating array methods](https://lorenstewart.me/2017/01/22/javascript-array-methods-mutating-vs-non-mutating/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is Big O Notation?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nBig O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. The best algorithms will execute the fastest and have the simplest complexity.\n\nAlgorithms don't always perform the same and may vary based on the data they are supplied. While in some cases they will execute quickly, in other cases they will execute slowly, even with the same number of elements to deal with.\n\nIn these examples, the base time is 1 element = `1ms`.\n\n##### O(1)\n\n```js\narr[arr.length - 1]\n```\n\n* 1000 elements = `1ms`\n\nConstant time complexity. No matter how many elements the array has, it will theoretically take (excluding real-world variation) the same amount of time to execute.\n\n##### O(N)\n\n```js\narr.filter(fn)\n```\n\n* 1000 elements = `1000ms`\n\nLinear time complexity. The execution time will increase linearly with the number of elements the array has. If the array has 1000 elements and the function takes 1ms to execute, 7000 elements will take 7ms to execute. This is because the function must iterate through all elements of the array before returning a result.\n\n##### O([1, N])\n\n```js\narr.some(fn)\n```\n\n* 1000 elements = `1ms <= x <= 1000ms`\n\nThe execution time varies depending on the data supplied to the function, it may return very early or very late. The best case here is O(1) and the worst case is O(N).\n\n##### O(NlogN)\n\n```js\narr.sort(fn)\n```\n\n* 1000 elements ~= `10000ms`\n\nBrowsers usually implement the quicksort algorithm for the `sort()` method and the average time complexity of quicksort is O(NlgN). This is very efficient for large collections.\n\n##### O(N^2)\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n  for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* 1000 elements = `1000000ms`\n\nThe execution time rises quadratically with the number of elements. Usually the result of nesting loops.\n\n##### O(N!)\n\n```js\nconst permutations = arr => {\n  if (arr.length <= 2) return arr.length === 2 ? [arr, [arr[1], arr[0]]] : arr\n  return arr.reduce(\n    (acc, item, i) =>\n      acc.concat(\n        permutations([...arr.slice(0, i), ...arr.slice(i + 1)]).map(val => [\n          item,\n          ...val\n        ])\n      ),\n    []\n  )\n}\n```\n\n* 1000 elements = `Infinity` (practically) ms\n\nThe execution time rises extremely fast with even just 1 addition to the array.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Be wary of nesting loops as execution time increases exponentially.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Big O Notation in JavaScript](https://medium.com/cesars-tech-insights/big-o-notation-javascript-25c79f50b19b)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is a pure function?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nA pure function is a function that satisfies these two conditions:\n\n* Given the same input, the function returns the same output.\n* The function doesn't cause side effects outside of the function's scope (i.e. mutate data outside the function or data supplied to the function).\n\nPure functions can mutate local data within the function as long as it satisfies the two conditions above.\n\n##### Pure\n\n```js\nconst a = (x, y) => x + y\nconst b = (arr, value) => arr.concat(value)\nconst c = arr => [...arr].sort((a, b) => a - b)\n```\n\n##### Impure\n\n```js\nconst a = (x, y) => x + y + Math.random()\nconst b = (arr, value) => (arr.push(value), arr)\nconst c = arr => arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Pure functions are easier to reason about due to their reliability.\n* All functions should be pure unless explicitly causing a side effect (i.e. `setInnerHTML`).\n* If a function does not return a value, it is an indication that it is causing side effects.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Pure functions in JavaScript](http://www.nicoespeon.com/en/2015/01/pure-functions-javascript/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is recursion and when is it useful?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nRecursion is the repeated application of a process. In JavaScript, recursion involves functions that call themselves repeatedly until they reach a base condition. The base condition breaks out of the recursion loop because otherwise the function would call itself indefinitely. Recursion is very useful when working with data structures that contain nesting where the number of levels deep is unknown.\n\nFor example, you may have a thread of comments returned from a database that exist in a flat array but need to be nested for display in the UI. Each comment is either a top-level comment (no parent) or is a reply to a parent comment. Comments can be a reply of a reply of a reply... we have no knowledge beforehand the number of levels deep a comment may be. This is where recursion can help.\n\n```js\nconst nest = (items, id = null, link = \"parent_id\") =>\n  items\n    .filter(item => item[link] === id)\n    .map(item => ({ ...item, children: nest(items, item.id) }))\n\nconst comments = [\n  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: \"First reply to post.\" },\n  { id: 2, parent_id: 1, text: \"First reply to comment #1.\" },\n  { id: 3, parent_id: 1, text: \"Second reply to comment #1.\" },\n  { id: 4, parent_id: 3, text: \"First reply to comment #3.\" },\n  { id: 5, parent_id: 4, text: \"First reply to comment #4.\" },\n  { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: \"Second reply to post.\" }\n]\n\nnest(comments)\n/*\n[\n  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: \"First reply to post.\", children: [...] },\n  { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: \"Second reply to post.\", children: [] }\n]\n*/\n```\n\nIn the above example, the base condition is met if `filter()` returns an empty array. The chained `map()` won't invoke the callback function which contains the recursive call, thereby breaking the loop.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Recursion is useful when working with data structures containing an unknown number of nested structures.\n* Recursion must have a base condition to be met that breaks out of the loop or it will call itself indefinitely.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [In plain English, what is recursion?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/25052/in-plain-english-what-is-recursion)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is memoization?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nMemoization is the process of caching the output of function calls so that subsequent calls are faster. Calling the function again with the same input will return the cached output without needing to do the calculation again.\n\nA basic implementation in JavaScript looks like this:\n\n```js\nconst memoize = fn => {\n  const cache = new Map()\n  return value => {\n    const cachedResult = cache.get(value)\n    if (cachedResult !== undefined) return cachedResult\n    const result = fn(value)\n    cache.set(value, result)\n    return result\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* The above technique returns a unary function even if the function can take multiple arguments.\n* The first function call will be slower than usual because of the overhead created by checking if a cached result exists and setting a result before returning the value.\n* Memoization increases performance on subsequent function calls but still needs to do work on the first call.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Implementing memoization in JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/implementing-memoization-in-javascript/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What are refs in React? When should they be used?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nRefs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. Refs should be used sparringly, but there are some good use cases for refs, such as:\n\n* Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.\n* Triggering imperative animations.\n* Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.\n\nRefs are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, assign the `ref` to the instance property within the constructor:\n\n```js\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.myRef = React.createRef()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <div ref={this.myRef} />\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRefs can also be used in functional components with the help of closures.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Refs are used to return a reference to an element.\n* Refs shouldn't be overused.\n* You can create a ref using `React.createRef()` and attach to elements via the `ref` attribute.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Refs and the DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Explain the differences between imperative and declarative programming.\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nThese two types of programming can roughly be summarized as:\n\n* Imperative: **how** to achieve something\n* Declarative: **what** should be achieved\n\nA common example of declarative programming is CSS. The developer specifies CSS properties that describe what something should look like rather than how to achieve it. The \"how\" is abstracted away by the browser.\n\nOn the other hand, imperative programming involves the steps required to achieve something. In JavaScript, the differences can be contrasted like so:\n\n##### Imperative\n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nconst numbersDoubled = []\nfor (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\n  numbersDoubled[i] = numbers[i] * 2\n}\n```\n\nWe manually loop over the numbers of the array and assign the new index as the number doubled.\n\n##### Declarative\n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2)\n```\n\nWe declare that the new array is mapped to a new one where each value is doubled.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Declarative programming often works with functions and expressions. Imperative programming frequently uses statements and relies on low-level features that cause mutations, while declarative programming has a strong focus on abstraction and purity.\n* Declarative programming is more terse and easier to process at a glance.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Declarative vs Imperative Programming](https://codeburst.io/declarative-vs-imperative-programming-a8a7c93d9ad2)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is functional programming?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nFunctional programming is a paradigm in which programs are built in a declarative manner using pure functions that avoid shared state and mutable data.

When the program emits events, the program responds by running any callback functions that are registered to that event and context, passing in associated data to the function. With this pattern, events can be emitted into the wild without throwing errors even if no functions are subscribed to it.\n\nA common example of this is the pattern of elements listening to DOM events such as `click` and `mouseenter`, where a callback function is run when the event occurs.\n\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener(\"click\", function(event) {\n  // This callback function is run when the user\n  // clicks on the document.\n})\n```\n\nWithout the context of the DOM, the pattern may look like this:\n\n```js\nconst hub = createEventHub()\nhub.on(\"message\", function(data) {\n  console.log(`${data.username} said ${data.text}`)\n})\nhub.emit(\"message\", {\n  username: \"John\",\n  text: \"Hello?\"\n})\n```\n\nWith this implementation, `on` is the way to _subscribe_ to an event, while `emit` is the way to _publish_ the event.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Follows a publish-subscribe pattern.\n* Responds to events that occur by running any callback functions subscribed to the event.\n* Show how to create a simple pub-sub implementation with JavaScript.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [MDN docs on Events and Handlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Overview_of_Events_and_Handlers)\n* [Understanding Node.js event-driven architecture](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-node-js-event-driven-architecture-223292fcbc2d)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is context?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nContext provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Can you give a useful example of one?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nA closure is a function defined inside another function and has access to its lexical scope even when it is executing outside its lexical scope. The closure has access to variables in three scopes:\n\n* Variables declared in its own scope\n* Variables declared in the scope of the parent function\n* Variables declared in the global scope\n\nIn JavaScript, all functions are closures because they have access to the outer scope, but most functions don't utilise the usefulness of closures: the persistence of state. Closures are also sometimes called stateful functions because of this.\n\nIn addition, closures are the only way to store private data that can't be accessed from the outside in JavaScript.

Regular functions can have their `this` value changed with the methods `call()`, `apply()` and `bind()`. Arrow functions implicitly bind `this` so that it refers to the context of its lexical environment, regardless of whether or not its context is set explicitly with `call()`.\n\nHere are some common examples of how `this` works:\n\n##### Object literals\n\n`this` refers to the object itself inside regular functions if the object precedes the invocation of the function.\n\nProperties set as `this` do not refer to the object.\n\n```js\nvar myObject = {\n  property: this,\n  regularFunction: function() {\n    return this\n  },\n  arrowFunction: () => {\n    return this\n  },\n  iife: (function() {\n    return this\n  })()\n}\nmyObject.regularFunction() // myObject\nmyObject[\"regularFunction\"]() // my Object\n\nmyObject.property // NOT myObject; lexical `this`\nmyObject.arrowFunction() // NOT myObject; lexical `this`\nmyObject.iife // NOT myObject; lexical `this`\nconst regularFunction = myObject.regularFunction\nregularFunction() // NOT myObject; lexical `this`\n```\n\n##### Event listeners\n\n`this` refers to the element listening to the event.\n\n```js\ndocument.body.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  console.log(this) // document.body\n})\n```\n\n##### Constructors\n\n`this` refers to the newly created object.\n\n```js\nclass Example {\n  constructor() {\n    console.log(this) // myExample\n  }\n}\nconst myExample = new Example()\n```\n\n##### Manual\n\nWith `call()` and `apply()`, `this` refers to the object passed as the first argument.\n\n```js\nvar myFunction = function() {\n  return this\n}\nmyFunction.call({ customThis: true }) // { customThis: true }\n```\n\n##### Unwanted `this`\n\nBecause `this` can change depending on the scope, it can have unexpected values when using regular functions.\n\n```js\nvar obj = {\n  arr: [1, 2, 3],\n  doubleArr() {\n    return this.arr.map(function(value) {\n      // this is now this.arr\n      return this.double(value)\n    })\n  },\n  double() {\n    return value * 2\n  }\n}\nobj.doubleArr() // Uncaught TypeError: this.double is not a function\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* In non-strict mode, global `this` is the global object (`window` in browsers), while in strict mode global `this` is `undefined`.\n* `Function.prototype.call` and `Function.prototype.apply` set the `this` context of an executing function as the first argument, with `call` accepting a variadic number of arguments thereafter, and `apply` accepting an array as the second argument which are fed to the function in a variadic manner.\n* `Function.prototype.bind` returns a new function that enforces the `this` context as the first argument which cannot be changed by other functions.\n* If a function requires its `this` context to be changed based on how it is called, you must use the `function` keyword. Use arrow functions when you want `this` to be the surrounding (lexical) context.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [`this` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the `children` prop?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\n`children` is part of the props object passed to components that allows components to be passed as data to other components, providing the ability to compose components cleanly. There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop, such as `React.Children.map`, `React.Children.forEach`, `React.Children.count`, `React.Children.only` and `React.Children.toArray`. A simple usage example of the children prop is as follows:\n\n```js\nfunction GenericBox({ children }) {\n  return <div className=\"container\">{children}</div>\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <GenericBox>\n      <span>Hello</span> <span>World</span>\n    </GenericBox>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Children is a prop that allows components to be passed as data to other components.\n* The React API provides methods to work with this prop.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Children](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#children-in-jsx)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Which is the preferred option between callback refs and findDOMNode()?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nCallback refs are preferred over the `findDOMNode()` API, due to the fact that `findDOMNode()` prevents certain improvements in React in the future.\n\n```js\n// Legacy approach using findDOMNode()\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <div />\n  }\n}\n\n// Recommended approach using callback refs\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.node.scrollIntoView()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <div ref={node => (this.node = node)} />\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Callback refs are preferred over `findDOMNode()`.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Refs and the DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#exposing-dom-refs-to-parent-components)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the purpose of JavaScript UI libraries/frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Hyperapp, etc?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nThe main purpose is to avoid manipulating the DOM directly and keep the state of an application\nin sync with the UI easily. Additionally, they provide the ability to create components that can be reused when they have similar functionality with minor differences, avoiding duplication which would require multiple changes whenever the structure of a component which is reused in multiple places needs to be updated.\n\nWhen working with DOM manipulation libraries like jQuery, the data of an application is generally kept in the DOM itself, often as class names or `data` attributes. Manipulating the DOM to update the UI involves many extra steps and can introduce subtle bugs over time. Keeping the state separate and letting a framework handle the UI updates when the state changes reduces cognitive load. Saying you want the UI to look a certain way when the state is a certain value is the declarative way of creating an application, instead of the imperative way of manually updating the UI to reflect the new state.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* The virtual DOM is a representation of the real DOM tree in the form of plain objects, which allows a library to write code as if the entire document is thrown away and rebuilt on each change, while the real DOM only updates what needs to be changed.

It is considered a good practice and offers a lot of benefits, such as:\n\n* Easier debugging due to eliminating silent errors.\n* Disallows variable redefinition.\n* Prevents accidental global variables.\n* Oftentimes provides increased performance over identical code that is not running in strict mode.\n* Simplifies `eval()` and `arguments`.\n* Helps make JavaScript more secure.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Eliminates `this` coercion, throwing an error when `this` references a value of `null` or `undefined`.\n* Throws an error on invalid usage of `delete`.\n* Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [MDN docs for strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### How can you avoid callback hells?\n\n```js\ngetData(function(a) {\n  getMoreData(a, function(b) {\n    getMoreData(b, function(c) {\n      getMoreData(c, function(d) {\n        getMoreData(d, function(e) {\n          // ...\n        })\n      })\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nRefactoring the functions to return promises and using `async/await` is usually the best option. Instead of supplying the functions with callbacks that cause deep nesting, they return a promise that can be `await`ed and will be resolved once the data has arrived, allowing the next line of code to be evaluated in a sync-like fashion.\n\nThe above code can be restructured like so:\n\n```js\nasync function asyncAwaitVersion() {\n  const a = await getData()\n  const b = await getMoreData(a)\n  const c = await getMoreData(b)\n  const d = await getMoreData(c)\n  const e = await getMoreData(d)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThere are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells:\n\n* Modularization: break callbacks into independent functions\n* Use a control flow library, like async\n* Use generators with Promises\n* Use async/await (from v7 on)\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* As an efficient JavaScript developer, you have to avoid the constantly growing indentation level, produce clean and readable code and be able to handle complex flows.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Avoiding Callback Hell in Node.js](http://stackabuse.com/avoiding-callback-hell-in-node-js/)\n* [Asynchronous JavaScript: From Callback Hell to Async and Await](https://blog.hellojs.org/asynchronous-javascript-from-callback-hell-to-async-and-await-9b9ceb63c8e8)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is a virtual DOM and why is it used in libraries/frameworks?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nThe virtual DOM (VDOM) is a representation of the real DOM in the form of plain JavaScript objects. These objects have properties to describe the real DOM nodes they represent: the node name, its attributes, and child nodes.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"counter\">\n  <h1>0</h1>\n  <button>-</button>\n  <button>+</button>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe above markup's virtual DOM representation might look like this:\n\n```js\n{\n  nodeName: \"div\",\n  attributes: { class: \"counter\" },\n  children: [\n    {\n      nodeName: \"h1\",\n      attributes: {},\n      children: [0]\n    },\n    {\n      nodeName: \"button\",\n      attributes: {},\n      children: [\"-\"]\n    },\n    {\n      nodeName: \"button\",\n      attributes: {},\n      children: [\"+\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe library/framework uses the virtual DOM as a means to improve performance. When the state of an application changes, the real DOM needs to be updated to reflect it. However, changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM. The previous virtual DOM can be compared to the new virtual DOM very quickly in comparison.\n\nOnce the changes between the old VDOM and new VDOM have been calculated by the diffing engine of the framework, the real DOM can be patched efficiently in the least time possible to match the new state of the application.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Why accessing the DOM can be so costly.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [The difference between Virtual DOM and DOM](http://reactkungfu.com/2015/10/the-difference-between-virtual-dom-and-dom/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### How do you ensure methods have the correct `this` context in React component classes?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nIn JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. This means that their `this` context can be changed (in the case of an event handler, to the element that is listening to the event) and will not refer to the component instance. To solve this, `Function.prototype.bind()` can be used to enforce the `this` context as the component instance.\n\n```js\nconstructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n}\n\nhandleClick() {\n  // Perform some logic\n}\n```\n\n* The `bind` approach can be verbose and requires defining a `constructor`, so the new public class fields syntax is generally preferred:\n\n```js\nhandleClick = () => {\n  console.log('this is:', this);\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={this.handleClick}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n* You can also use an inline arrow function, because lexical `this` (referring to the component instance) is preserved:\n\n```js\n<button onClick={e => this.handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>\n```\n\nNote that extra re-rendering can occur using this technique because a new function reference is created on render, which gets passed down to child components and breaks `shouldComponentUpdate` / `PureComponent` shallow equality checks to prevent unnecessary re-renders. In cases where performance is important, it is preferred to go with `bind` in the constructor, or the public class fields syntax approach, because the function reference remains constant.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* You can either bind methods to the component instance context in the constructor, use public class fields syntax, or use inline arrow functions.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)\n* [React docs on Passing Functions to Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-functions.html#how-do-i-bind-a-function-to-a-component-instance)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n## React\n### What is a stateless component?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nA stateless component is a component whose behavior does not depend on its state.

Components can have state and take props as input and return an element tree as output (although they can represent generic containers or wrappers and don't necessarily have to emit DOM). Components can initiate side effects in lifecycle methods (e.g. AJAX requests, DOM mutations, interfacing with 3rd party libraries) and may be expensive to create.\n\n```js\nconst Component = () => \"Hello\"\nconst componentElement = <Component />\nconst domNodeElement = <div />\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Elements are immutable, plain objects that describe the DOM nodes or components you want to render.\n* Components can be either classes or functions, that take props as an input and return an element tree as the output.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)\n* [React docs on Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What does lifting state up in React mean?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nWhen several components need to share the same data, then it is recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.

Setting a `class` on an element meant using the `className` API:\n\n```js\nconst element = document.createElement(\"div\")\nelement.className = \"hello\"\n```\n\nAdditionally, before ES5, reserved words could not be used in objects:\n\n```js\nconst element = {\n  attributes: {\n    class: \"hello\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn IE8, this will throw an error.\n\nIn modern environments, destructuring will throw an error if trying to assign to a variable:\n\n```js\nconst { class } = this.props // Error\nconst { className } = this.props // All good\nconst { class: className } = this.props // All good, but cumbersome!\n```\n\nHowever, `class` _can_ be used as a prop without problems, as seen in other libraries like Preact. React currently allows you to use `class`, but will throw a warning and convert it to `className` under the hood. There is currently an open thread (as of January 2019) discussing changing `className` to `class` to reduce confusion.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### How do you pass an argument to an event handler or callback?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nYou can use an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass arguments, which is equivalent to calling `bind`:\n\n```js\n<button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} />\n<button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} />\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState`?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nThe callback function is invoked when `setState` has finished and the component gets rendered.

Used to update the state based on changes in props over time. Has rare use cases, like tracking component animations during the lifecycle. There are only few cases where this makes sense to use over other lifecycle methods. It expects to return an object that will be the the new state, or null to update nothing. This method does not have access to the component instance either.\n\n`componentDidMount`: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up eventListeners should occur.\n\n`shouldComponentUpdate`: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new prop.\n\n`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`: Invoked right after a component render happens because of an update, before `componentDidUpdate`. Any value returned from this method will be passed to `componentDidUpdate`.\n\n`componentDidUpdate`: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.\n\n`componentWillUnmount`: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.\n\n`componentDidCatch`: Used in error boundaries, which are components that implement this method. It allows the component to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the _child_ component tree (below this component), log errors, and display a UI with error information.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is a key?

Each element's key must be unique (e.g. IDs from the data or indexes as a last resort).\n\n```js\nconst todoItems = todos.map(todo => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>)\n```\n\n* Using indexes as keys is not recommended if the order of items may change, as it might negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.\n* If you extract list items as a separate component then apply keys on the list component instead of the `<li>` tag.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Keys give elements in a collection a stable identity and help React identify changes.\n* You should avoid using indexes as keys if the order of items may change.\n* You should lift the key up to the component, instead of the `<li>` element, if you extract list items as components.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Which is the preferred option between callback refs and findDOMNode()?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nCallback refs are preferred over the `findDOMNode()` API, due to the fact that `findDOMNode()` prevents certain improvements in React in the future.\n\n```js\n// Legacy approach using findDOMNode()\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <div />\n  }\n}\n\n// Recommended approach using callback refs\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.node.scrollIntoView()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <div ref={node => (this.node = node)} />\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Callback refs are preferred over `findDOMNode()`.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Refs and the DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#exposing-dom-refs-to-parent-components)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What are fragments?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nFragments allow a React component to return multiple elements without a wrapper, by grouping the children without adding extra elements to the DOM. Fragments offer better performance, lower memory usage, a cleaner DOM and can help in dealing with certain CSS mechanisms (e.g. tables, Flexbox and Grid).\n\n```js\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <React.Fragment>\n      <ChildA />\n      <ChildB />\n      <ChildC />\n    </React.Fragment>\n  );\n}\n\n// Short syntax supported by Babel 7\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <ChildA />\n      <ChildB />\n      <ChildC />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Fragments group multiple elements returned from a component, without adding a DOM element around them.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### How do you ensure methods have the correct `this` context in React component classes?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nIn JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. This means that their `this` context can be changed (in the case of an event handler, to the element that is listening to the event) and will not refer to the component instance. To solve this, `Function.prototype.bind()` can be used to enforce the `this` context as the component instance.\n\n```js\nconstructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n}\n\nhandleClick() {\n  // Perform some logic\n}\n```\n\n* The `bind` approach can be verbose and requires defining a `constructor`, so the new public class fields syntax is generally preferred:\n\n```js\nhandleClick = () => {\n  console.log('this is:', this);\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={this.handleClick}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n* You can also use an inline arrow function, because lexical `this` (referring to the component instance) is preserved:\n\n```js\n<button onClick={e => this.handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>\n```\n\nNote that extra re-rendering can occur using this technique because a new function reference is created on render, which gets passed down to child components and breaks `shouldComponentUpdate` / `PureComponent` shallow equality checks to prevent unnecessary re-renders. In cases where performance is important, it is preferred to go with `bind` in the constructor, or the public class fields syntax approach, because the function reference remains constant.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* You can either bind methods to the component instance context in the constructor, use public class fields syntax, or use inline arrow functions.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)\n* [React docs on Passing Functions to Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-functions.html#how-do-i-bind-a-function-to-a-component-instance)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What are error boundaries in React?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nError boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.\n\nClass components become error boundaries if they define either (or both) of the lifecycle methods `static getDerivedStateFromError()` or `componentDidCatch().`\n\n```js\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { hasError: false }\n  }\n\n  // Use componentDidCatch to log the error\n  componentDidCatch(error, info) {\n    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service\n    logErrorToMyService(error, info)\n  }\n  \n  // use getDerivedStateFromError to update state\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\n    // Display fallback UI\n     return { hasError: true };\n  }\n\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      // You can render any custom fallback UI\n      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>\n    }\n    return this.props.children\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Error boundaries only catch errors in the components below them in the tree.

It is a pattern that is derived from React\u2019s compositional nature. Higher-order components are like **pure components** because they accept any dynamically provided child component, but they won\u2019t modify or copy any behavior from their input components.\n\n```js\nconst EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* They can be used for state abstraction and manipulation, props manipulation, render high jacking, etc.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### How to apply prop validation in React?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nWhen the application is running in development mode, React will automatically check for all props that we set on components to make sure they are the correct data type. For incorrect data types, it will generate warning messages in the console for development mode. They are stripped in production mode due to their performance impact. Required props are defined with `isRequired`.\n\nFor example, we define `propTypes` for component as below:\n\n```js\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\"\n\nclass User extends React.Component {\n  static propTypes = {\n    name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n    age: PropTypes.number.isRequired\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <h1>Welcome, {this.props.name}</h1>\n      <h2>Age, {this.props.age}\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* We can define custom `propTypes`\n* Using `propTypes` is not mandatory.

When should they be used?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nRefs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. Refs should be used sparringly, but there are some good use cases for refs, such as:\n\n* Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.\n* Triggering imperative animations.\n* Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.\n\nRefs are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, assign the `ref` to the instance property within the constructor:\n\n```js\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.myRef = React.createRef()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <div ref={this.myRef} />\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRefs can also be used in functional components with the help of closures.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Refs are used to return a reference to an element.\n* Refs shouldn't be overused.\n* You can create a ref using `React.createRef()` and attach to elements via the `ref` attribute.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Refs and the DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the `children` prop?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\n`children` is part of the props object passed to components that allows components to be passed as data to other components, providing the ability to compose components cleanly. There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop, such as `React.Children.map`, `React.Children.forEach`, `React.Children.count`, `React.Children.only` and `React.Children.toArray`. A simple usage example of the children prop is as follows:\n\n```js\nfunction GenericBox({ children }) {\n  return <div className=\"container\">{children}</div>\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <GenericBox>\n      <span>Hello</span> <span>World</span>\n    </GenericBox>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Children is a prop that allows components to be passed as data to other components.\n* The React API provides methods to work with this prop.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Children](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#children-in-jsx)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What are portals in React?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nPortal are the recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.\n\n```js\nReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)\n```\n\nThe first argument (`child`) is any renderable React child, such as an element, string, or fragment.

The server is set up to send headers that tell the browser to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.\n\nHowever, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by developers because the user's cache still references old files. This can either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the cached CSS and JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer exist, have moved or have been renamed.\n\nCache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new files. This is done by naming the file something different to the old file.\n\nA common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to append a query string to the end of the file.\n\n* `src=\"js/script.js\"` => `src=\"js/script.js?v=2\"`\n\nThe browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to change the file name.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Strategies for cache-busting CSS](https://css-tricks.com/strategies-for-cache-busting-css/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Can a web page contain multiple `<header>` elements?

Scripts are downloaded and executed in the order\nthey are encountered.\n\nThe `defer` attribute downloads the script while the document is still parsing but waits until the document has finished parsing before executing it, equivalent to executing inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. `defer` scripts will execute in order.\n\nThe `async` attribute downloads the script during parsing the document but will pause the parser to execute the script before it has fully finished parsing. `async` scripts will not necessarily execute in order.\n\nNote: both attributes must only be used if the script has a `src` attribute (i.e. not an inline script).\n\n```html\n<script src=\"myscript.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"myscript.js\" defer></script>\n<script src=\"myscript.js\" async></script>\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Placing a `defer` script in the `<head>` allows the browser to download the script while the page is still parsing, and is therefore a better option than placing the script before the end of the body.\n* If the scripts rely on each other, use `defer`.\n* If the script is independent, use `async`.\n* Use `defer` if the DOM must be ready and the contents are not placed within a `DOMContentLoaded` listener.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [async vs defer attributes](http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nIn HTML, the attribute name is in all lowercase and is given a string invoking a function defined somewhere:\n\n```html\n<button onclick=\"handleClick()\"></button>\n```\n\nIn React, the attribute name is camelCase and are passed the function reference inside curly braces:\n\n```js\n<button onClick={handleClick} />\n```\n\nIn HTML, `false` can be returned to prevent default behavior, whereas in React `preventDefault` has to be called explicitly.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false\" />\n```\n\n```js\nfunction handleClick(e) {\n  e.preventDefault()\n  console.log(\"The link was clicked.\")\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* HTML uses lowercase, React uses camelCase.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [React docs on Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What are some differences that XHTML has compared to HTML?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nSome of the key differences are:\n\n* An XHTML element must have an XHTML `<DOCTYPE>`\n* Attributes values must be enclosed in quotes\n* Attribute minimization is forbidden (e.g. one has to use `checked=\"checked\"` instead of `checked`)\n* Elements must always be properly nested\n* Elements must always be closed\n* Special characters must be escaped\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Any element can be self-closed\n* Tags ands attributes are case-sensitive, usually lowercase\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [W3Schools docs for HTML and XHTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_xhtml.asp)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the DOM?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nThe DOM (Document Object Model) is a cross-platform API that treats HTML and XML documents as a tree structure consisting of nodes. These nodes (such as elements and text nodes) are objects that can be programmatically manipulated and any visible changes made to them are reflected live in the document. In a browser, this API is available to JavaScript where DOM nodes can be manipulated to change their styles, contents, placement in the document, or interacted with through event listeners.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.\n* The DOM is constructed progressively in the browser as a page loads, which is why scripts are often placed at the bottom of a page, in the `<head>` with a `defer` attribute, or inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.

In addition, a specification provides instructions on how a browser must interpret and render such a document.\n\nA browser is said to \u201csupport\u201d a specification if it handles valid documents according to the rules of the specification. As of yet, no browser supports all aspects of the `HTML5` specification (although all of the major browser support most of it), and as a result, it is necessary for the developer to confirm whether the aspect they are making use of will be supported by all of the browsers on which they hope to display their content. This is why cross-browser support continues to be a headache for developers, despite the improved specificiations.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* `HTML5` defines some rules to follow for an invalid `HTML5` document (i.e., one that contains syntactical errors)\n* However, invalid documents may contain anything, so it's impossible for the specification to handle all possibilities comprehensively.\n* Thus, many decisions about how to handle malformed documents are left up to the browser.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [HTML 5.2 WWW Specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is HTML5 Web Storage?

When the tab is permanently closed, any data stored through `sessionStorage` is deleted.\n\n**Differences between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` regarding storage scope:**\nBoth forms of storage are scoped to the document origin so that documents with different origins will never share the stored objects.\n\n* `sessionStorage` is also scoped on a per-window basis.

BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a \"namespace\" for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style.\n\n```css\n/* block component */\n.block {\n}\n\n/* element */\n.block__element {\n}\n\n/* modifier */\n.block__element--modifier {\n}\n```\n\nHere is an example with the class names on markup:\n\n```html\n<nav class=\"navbar\">\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link navbar__link--active\"></a>\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\"></a>\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\"></a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nIn this case, `navbar` is the Block, `navbar__link` is an Element that makes no sense outside of the `navbar` component, and `navbar__link--active` is a Modifier that indicates a different state for the `navbar__link` Element.\n\nSince Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use `is-*` flags instead as modifiers.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link is-active\"></a>\n```\n\nThese must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there will be scope issues.\n\n```css\n.navbar__link.is-active {\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Alternative solutions to scope issues like CSS-in-JS\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Writing clean and maintainable CSS](https://hackernoon.com/writing-clean-and-maintainable-css-using-bem-methodology-1dcbf810a664)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What are the advantages of using CSS preprocessors?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nCSS preprocessors add useful functionality that native CSS does not have, and generally make CSS neater and more maintainable by enabling DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

They provide variables for consistent theming (however, CSS variables have largely replaced this functionality) and additional tools like color functions (`lighten`, `darken`, `transparentize`, etc), mixins, and loops that make CSS more like a real programming language and gives the developer more power to generate complex CSS.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* They allow us to write more maintainable and scalable CSS\n* Some disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors (setup, re-compilation time can be slow etc.)\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [CSS Preprocessors](https://medium.com/@garyfagan/css-preprocessors-6f226fa16f27)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Using flexbox, create a 3-column layout where each column takes up a `col-{n} / 12` ratio of the container.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-2\"></div>\n  <div class=\"col-7\"></div>\n  <div class=\"col-3\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nSet the `.row` parent to `display: flex;` and use the `flex` shorthand property to give the column classes a `flex-grow` value that corresponds to its ratio value.\n\n```css\n.row {\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n.col-2 {\n  flex: 2;\n}\n\n.col-7 {\n  flex: 7;\n}\n\n.col-3 {\n  flex: 3;\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [MDN docs for basic concepts of flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)\n* [A complete guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Can you name the four types of `@media` properties?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\n* `all`, which applies to all media type devices\n* `print`, which only applies to printers\n* `screen`, which only applies to screens (desktops, tablets, mobile etc.)\n* `speech`, which only applies to screenreaders\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [MDN docs for `@media` rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media)\n* [MDN docs for using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Describe the layout of the CSS Box Model and briefly describe each component.\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\n<!-- Your answer goes here. -->\n\n`Content`: The inner-most part of the box filled with content, such as text, an image, or video player.

Even under the new HTTP/2 protocol, this remains true.\n\nUnder HTTP/1.1, at most one request is allowed per TCP connection. With HTTP/1.1, modern browsers open multiple parallel connections (between 2 to 8) but it is limited. With HTTP/2, all requests between the browser and the server are multiplexed on a single TCP connection. This means the cost of opening and closing multiple connections is mitigated, resulting in a better usage of the TCP connection and limits the impact of latency between the client and server. It could then become possible to load tens of images in parallel on the same TCP connection.\n\nHowever, according to [benchmark results](https://blog.octo.com/en/http2-arrives-but-sprite-sets-aint-no-dead/), although HTTP/2 offers 50% improvement over HTTP/1.1, in most cases the sprite set is still faster to load than individual images.\n\nTo utilize a spritesheet in CSS, one would use certain properties, such as `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` to ultimately alter the `background` of an element.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` can be used to utilize a spritesheet.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [CSS Sprites explained by CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the difference between '+' and '~' sibling selectors?.\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nThe General Sibling Selector `~` selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.\n\nThe following example selects all `<p>` elements that are siblings of `<div>` elements:\n\n```css\ndiv ~ p {\n  background-color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nThe Adjacent Sibling Selector `+` selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.\n\nThe following example will select all `<p>` elements that are placed immediately after `<div>` elements:\n\n```css\ndiv + p {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [W3School's CSS Combinators Page](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp)\n* [Mozilla's Combinators and groups of selectors page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Combinators_and_multiple_selectors)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Can you describe how CSS specificity works?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nAssuming the browser has already determined the set of rules for an element, each rule is assigned a matrix of values, which correspond to the following from highest to lowest specificity:\n\n* Inline rules (binary - 1 or 0)\n* Number of id selectors\n* Number of class, pseudo-class and attribute selectors\n* Number of tags and pseudo-element selectors\n\nWhen two selectors are compared, the comparison is made on a per-column basis (e.g. an id selector will always be higher than any amount of class selectors, as ids have higher specificity than classes). In cases of equal specificity between multiple rules, the rules that comes last in the page's style sheet is deemed more specific and therefore applied to the element.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Specificity matrix: [inline, id, class/pseudo-class/attribute, tag/pseudo-element]\n* In cases of equal specificity, last rule is applied\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [CSS Specificity](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is a focus ring? What is the correct solution to handle them?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nA focus ring is a visible outline given to focusable elements such as buttons and anchor tags. It varies depending on the vendor, but generally it appears as a blue outline around the element to indicate it is currently focused.\n\nIn the past, many people specified `outline: 0;` on the element to remove the focus ring. However, this causes accessibility issues for keyboard users because the focus state may not be clear. When not specified though, it causes an unappealing blue ring to appear around an element.\n\nIn recent times, frameworks like Bootstrap have opted to use a more appealing `box-shadow` outline to replace the default focus ring. However, this is still not ideal for mouse users.\n\nThe best solution is an upcoming pseudo-selector `:focus-visible` which can be polyfilled today with JavaScript. It will only show a focus ring if the user is using a keyboard and leave it hidden for mouse users. This keeps both aesthetics for mouse use and accessibility for keyboard use.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [:focus-visible](https://css-tricks.com/focus-visible-and-backwards-compatibility/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n## Accessibility\n### What is WCAG? What are the differences between A, AA, and AAA compliance?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nWCAG stands for \"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\". It is a standard describing how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities\nThey have 12-13 guidelines and for each one, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA. The higher the level, the higher the impact on the design of the web content. The higher the level, the web content is essentially more accessible by more users.\nDepending on where you live/work, there may be regulations requiring websites to meet certain levels of compliance. For instance, in Ontario, Canada, beginning January 1, 2021 all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet AA compliance.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* A guideline for making web content more accessible\n* 3 different levels (A, AA, and AAA) of compliance for each guideline\n* Governments are starting to require web content to meet a certain level of compliance by law\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)\n* [How to Meet WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is ARIA and when should you use it?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nARIA stands for \"Accessible Rich Internet Applications\", and is a technical specification created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Better known as WAI-ARIA, it provides additional HTML attributes in the development of web applications to offer people who use assistive technologies (AT) a more robust and interoperable experience with dynamic components. By providing the component's role, name, and state, AT users can better understand how to interact with the component. WAI-ARIA should only be used when an HTML element equivalent is not available or lacks full browser or AT support. WAI-ARIA's semantic markup coupled with JavaScript works to provide an understandable and interactive experience for people who use AT.\n\nAn example using ARIA:\n\n```\n<div \n  role=\"combobox\"\n  aria-expanded=\"false\"\n  aria-owns=\"ex1-grid\"\n  aria-haspopup=\"grid\"\n  id=\"ex1-combobox\">\n  ...\n</div>\n```\nCredit: W3C's [ARIA 1.1 Combobox with Grid Popup Example](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/combobox/aria1.1pattern/grid-combo.html)\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Accessible Rich Internet Applications\n* Benefits people who use assistive technologies (AT)\n* Provides role, name, and state\n* Semantic HTML coupled with JavaScript\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [WAI-ARIA Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/)\n* [WAI-ARIA Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/)\n* [ARIA Serious?

The Landmarks helps assistive technology users to navigate a page, allowing them skip over areas of it.\n\nFor example,\n```html\n<div id=\"header\" role=\"banner\">Header of the Page</div>\n<div id=\"content\" role=\"main\">Main Content Goes Here</div>\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Identify sections of a page\n* Assist users in navigating a page\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [ARIA Landmark Roles](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/web/landmarks/)\n* [Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_landmarks_to_identify_regions_of_a_page)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n## Node\n### NodeJS often uses a callback pattern where if an error is encountered during execution, this error is passed as the first argument to the callback. What are the advantages of this pattern?\n\n```js\nfs.readFile(filePath, function(err, data) {\n  if (err) {\n    // handle the error, the return is important here\n    // so execution stops here\n    return console.log(err)\n  }\n  // use the data object\n  console.log(data)\n})\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nAdvantages include:\n\n* Not needing to process data if there is no need to even reference it\n* Having a consistent API leads to more adoption\n* Ability to easily adapt a callback pattern that will lead to more maintainable code\n\nAs you can see from below example, the callback is called with null as its first argument if there is no error. However, if there is an error, you create an Error object, which then becomes the callback's only parameter. The callback function allows a user to easily know whether or not an error occurred.\n\nThis practice is also called the _Node.js error convention_, and this kind of callback implementations are called _error-first callbacks_.\n\n```js\nvar isTrue = function(value, callback) {\n  if (value === true) {\n    callback(null, \"Value was true.\")\n  } else {\n    callback(new Error(\"Value is not true!\"))\n  }\n}\n\nvar callback = function(error, retval) {\n  if (error) {\n    console.log(error)\n    return\n  }\n  console.log(retval)\n}\n\nisTrue(false, callback)\nisTrue(true, callback)\n\n/*\n  { stack: [Getter/Setter],\n    arguments: undefined,\n    type: undefined,\n    message: 'Value is not true!' }\n  Value was true.\n*/\n```\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* This is just a convention.

A RESTful web application exposes data in the form of information about its resources.\n\nGenerally, this concept is used in web applications to manage state. With most applications, there is a common theme of reading, creating, updating, and destroying data. Data is modularized into separate tables like `posts`, `users`, `comments`, and a RESTful API exposes access to this data with:\n\n* An identifier for the resource. This is known as the endpoint or URL for the resource.\n* The operation the server should perform on that resource in the form of an HTTP method or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n\nHere is an example of the URL and HTTP method with a `posts` resource:\n\n* Reading: `/posts/` => GET\n* Creating: `/posts/new` => POST\n* Updating: `/posts/:id` => PUT\n* Destroying: `/posts/:id` => DELETE\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* Alternatives to this pattern like GraphQL\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n*   ](https://medium.com/extend/what-is-rest-a-simple-explanation-for-beginners-part-1-introduction-b4a072f8740f)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### How can you avoid callback hells?\n\n```js\ngetData(function(a) {\n  getMoreData(a, function(b) {\n    getMoreData(b, function(c) {\n      getMoreData(c, function(d) {\n        getMoreData(d, function(e) {\n          // ...\n        })\n      })\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nRefactoring the functions to return promises and using `async/await` is usually the best option. Instead of supplying the functions with callbacks that cause deep nesting, they return a promise that can be `await`ed and will be resolved once the data has arrived, allowing the next line of code to be evaluated in a sync-like fashion.\n\nThe above code can be restructured like so:\n\n```js\nasync function asyncAwaitVersion() {\n  const a = await getData()\n  const b = await getMoreData(a)\n  const c = await getMoreData(b)\n  const d = await getMoreData(c)\n  const e = await getMoreData(d)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThere are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells:\n\n* Modularization: break callbacks into independent functions\n* Use a control flow library, like async\n* Use generators with Promises\n* Use async/await (from v7 on)\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* As an efficient JavaScript developer, you have to avoid the constantly growing indentation level, produce clean and readable code and be able to handle complex flows.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Avoiding Callback Hell in Node.js](http://stackabuse.com/avoiding-callback-hell-in-node-js/)\n* [Asynchronous JavaScript: From Callback Hell to Async and Await](https://blog.hellojs.org/asynchronous-javascript-from-callback-hell-to-async-and-await-9b9ceb63c8e8)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n### What is the event loop in Node.js?\n\n<details>\n<summary>View answer</summary>\n\nThe event loop handles all async callbacks.

This is often achieved when the application does not validate user input and freely injects dynamic HTML content.\n\nFor example, a comment system will be at risk if it does not validate or escape user input. If the comment contains unescaped HTML, the comment can inject a `<script>` tag into the website that other users will execute against their knowledge.\n\n* The malicious script has access to cookies which are often used to store session tokens. If an attacker can obtain a user\u2019s session cookie, they can impersonate the user.\n* The script can arbitrarily manipulate the DOM of the page the script is executing in, allowing the attacker to insert pieces of content that appear to be a real part of the website.\n* The script can use AJAX to send HTTP requests with arbitrary content to arbitrary destinations.\n\n\n#### Good to hear\n\n\n* On the client, using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` prevents the browser from running the string through the HTML parser which would execute scripts in it.\n* On the server, escaping HTML tags will prevent the browser from parsing the user input as actual HTML and therefore won't execute the script.\n\n\n##### Additional Links\n\n\n* [Cross-Site Scripting Attack (XSS)](https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/cross-site-scripting/)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>[\u2b06 Back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE).
