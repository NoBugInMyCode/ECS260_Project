It's useful for tagging, contact lists, country selectors, and so on. The goal is to provide a solid & usable experience with a clean and powerful API.\n\n- [Demos](https://selectize.dev/docs/demos)\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/releases)\n- [Documentation](https://selectize.dev/docs/api)\n\n## Features\n\n- **Smart Option Searching / Ranking**\n  Options are efficiently scored and sorted on-the-fly (using [sifter](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js)). Want to search for an item's title _and_ description? No problem.\n- **Caret between items**\n  Order matters sometimes. Use the <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> arrow keys to move between selected items.\n- **Select & delete multiple items at once**\n  Hold down <kbd>option</kbd> on Mac or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> on Windows to select more than one item to delete.\n- **D\u00ed\u00e5crit\u00ee\u00e7s supported**\n  Great for international environments.\n- **Item creation**\n  Allow users to create items on the fly (async saving is supported; the control locks until the callback is fired).\n- **Remote data loading**\n  For when you have thousands of options and want them provided by the server as the user types.\n- **Clean API &amp; code**\n  Interface with it and make modifications easily. Pull requests are always welcome!\n- **Extensible**\n  [Plugin API](docs/plugins.md) for developing custom features (uses [microplugin](https://github.com/brianreavis/microplugin.js)).\n- **Touch Support**\n  Plays nice with iOS 5+ devices.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) (1.7 and greater), as [peer dependency](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/)\n  - **Note:** it is installed automatically in development, or in projects using NPM 1 or 2. When using NPM from version 3 on, just a warning is thrown and the user needs to manually install an explicit version in their own project (e.g. `npm install --save jquery@3.5.1`).\n\n**Optional:**\n\n- [jquery-ui](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui) (required by `drag_drop` plugin)\n\n### Installation\n\nSelectize can be installed via NPM `npm install @selectize/selectize`\n\n#### Installing Manually\n\nAll pre-built files needed to use Selectize can be found in the\n[\"dist\"](dist/) folder.\n\nIf you're looking to get started with minimal fuss, include\n`selectize.min.js` (bundles Sifter and Microplugin\ndependencies \u2013 also available un-minified for debugging, just remove the\n`.min` part) and `css/selectize.default.css`.\n\nSelectize is available at [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/selectize.js).\n\n- [**js/**](dist/js)\n  - [selectize.js](dist/js/selectize.js) \u2014 With dependencies, minus jquery\n  - [selectize.min.js](dist/js/selectize.min.js) \u2014 With dependencies, minus jquery\n- [**scss/**](dist/scss) \u2014 Sass source files for customization (Bootstrap 3+ compatible)\n- [**less/**](dist/less) \u2014 Less source files for customization (Bootstrap 2/3 compatible)\n- [**css/**](dist/css)\n  - [selectize.css](dist/css/selectize.css) \u2014 Core styles\n  - [selectize.default.css](dist/css/selectize.default.css) \u2014 Default theme (with core styles)\n  - [selectize.bootstrap2.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap2.css) - Bootstrap 2 theme\n  - [selectize.bootstrap3.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap3.css) - Bootstrap 3 theme\n  - [selectize.bootstrap4.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap4.css) - Bootstrap 4 theme\n  - [selectize.bootstrap5.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap5.css) - Bootstrap 5 theme\n\n### Usage\n\n```js\n$(\"select\").selectize(options);\n```\n\nThe available options are [documented here](https://selectize.dev/docs/api).\n\n### Contributing\n\nWhen issuing a pull request:\n\n- please **do not include/commit changes in the `dist/` or `lib/` folders** to avoid\n  merge conflicts. A good way to include the right files is to use\n  `git gui` or `git add` when committing to select the files you want to\n  add to your commit.\n\n- please **include tests** with your feature so that we're not tempted to\n  break it in the future!\n\nAdd an entry to the top of the CHANGELOG, and update the documentation\nin `docs/` as needed. (Refactors and documentation changes don't need a\nchangelog entry.)\n\nSquash your commits together in one or a few complete, logical commits,\nwith a concise and descriptive message. One commit means one\nfeature/bugfix/thing that has changed, or a diff bringing the code one\nstep forward to a better, working state.\n\nOnce your commit is nice and clean, and you want to _discard the other\nchanges_, you can use `git checkout .` (that will erase changes to\ntracked files) and `git clean [-i/--interactive]` (to erase untracked\nfiles). **However, be careful with those commands, as their function\nis to erase things/changes.**\n\nHowever, be careful not to add the `dist/` files in your commit, as\nGrunt automatically regenerates the files in `dist/` as the source is\nchanged.\n\n#### Tests\n\nPlease ensure all the tests pass:\n\n```sh\nnpm test # defaults to ChromHeadless\nBROWSERS=Firefox npm test\nBROWSERS=Firefox,Chrome npm test\nBROWSERS=Firefox,Chrome,Safari npm test\n```\n\n#### Local environment\n\nTo run Selectize locally:\n\n```sh\nnpm start\n```\n\nYou can then run the examples at `https://loopback.website:4000/`.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright &copy; 2013\u20132016 [Brian Reavis](http://twitter.com/brianreavis) & [Contributors](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/graphs/contributors)\\\nCopyright &copy; 2020-2022 Selectize Team & [Contributors](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/graphs/contributors)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
