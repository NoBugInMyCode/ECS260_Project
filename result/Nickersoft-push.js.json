The guy who originally made this library, [Tyler Nickerson](https://tylernickerson.com), while still visiting this repo from time to time, is busy trying to work on his company [Linguistic](https://github.com/linguistic) right now. As a result, he may not have time to answer everyone or fix bugs as quickly as they would like him too. If you find it pretty easy to find your way around this code and think you could help some people out, shoot me a message at [nickersoft@gmail.com](mailto:nickersoft@gmail.com) and let's talk.\n\n### What is Push? ###\n\nPush is the fastest way to get up and running with Javascript desktop notifications. A fairly new addition to the\nofficial specification, the Notification API allows modern browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE 9+ to push\nnotifications to a user's desktop. Push acts as a cross-browser solution to this API, falling back to use  older\nimplementations if the user's browser does not support the new API.\n\nYou can quickly install Push via [npm](http://npmjs.com):\n\n```\nnpm install push.js --save\n```\n\nOr, if you want something a little more lightweight, you can give [Bower](http://bower.io) a try:\n\n```\nbower install push.js --save\n```\n\n### Full Documentation ###\nFull documentation for Push can be found at the project's new homepage [https://pushjs.org](https://pushjs.org).\nSee you there!\n\n### Development ###\n\nIf you feel like this library is your jam and you want to contribute (or you think I'm an idiot who missed something),\ncheck out Push's neat [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) on how you can make your mark.\n\n### Credits ###\nPush is based off the following work:\n\n1. [HTML5-Desktop-Notifications](https://github.com/ttsvetko/HTML5-Desktop-Notifications) by [Tsvetan Tsvetkov](https://github.com/ttsvetko)\n2.
