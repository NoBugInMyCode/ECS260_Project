Uses weighted combination of AdaBins and MiDaS depth estimation models. Uses pytorch3d for 3D transforms on Colab and/or Linux.\n\n#### v5.1 Update: Mar 30th 2022 - zippy / Chris Allen and gandamu / Adam Letts\n\n- Integrated Turbo+Smooth features from Disco Diffusion Turbo -- just the implementation, without its defaults.\n- Implemented resume of turbo animations in such a way that it's now possible to resume from different batch folders and batch numbers.\n- 3D rotation parameter units are now degrees (rather than radians)\n- Corrected name collision in sampling_mode (now diffusion_sampling_mode for plms/ddim, and sampling_mode for 3D transform sampling)\n- Added video_init_seed_continuity option to make init video animations more continuous\n- Removed pytorch3d from needing to be compiled with a lite version specifically made for Disco Diffusion\n- Remove Super Resolution\n- Remove Slip Models\n- Update for crossplatform support\n\n#### v5.1 Update: Apr 4th 2022 - MSFTserver aka HostsServer\n\n- Removed pytorch3d from needing to be compiled with a lite version specifically made for Disco Diffusion\n- Remove Super Resolution\n- Remove Slip Models\n- Update for crossplatform support\n\n#### v5.2 Update: Apr 10th 2022 - nin_artificial / Tom Mason\n\n- VR Mode\n\n#### v5.3 Update: Jun 10th 2022 - nshepperd, huemin, cut_pow\n\n- Horizontal and Vertical symmetry\n- Addition of ViT-L/14@336px model (requires high VRAM)\n\n#### v5.4 Update: Jun 14th 2022 - devdef / Alex Spirin, integrated into DD main by gandamu / Adam Letts\n\n- Warp mode - for smooth/continuous video input results leveraging optical flow estimation and frame blending\n- Custom models support\n\n#### v5.5 Update: Jul 11th 2022 - Palmweaver / Chris Scalf, KaliYuga_ai, further integration by gandamu / Adam Letts\n\n- OpenCLIP models integration\n- Pixel Art Diffusion, Watercolor Diffusion, and Pulp SciFi Diffusion models\n- cut_ic_pow scheduling\n\n#### v5.6 Update: Jul 13th 2022 - Felipe3DArtist, integration by gandamu / Adam Letts\n\n- Integrated portrait_generator_v001 - 512x512 diffusion model trained on faces - from Felipe3DArtist\n\n#### v5.7 Update: Dec 31st 2022 - Steffen Moelter (with minor colab-convert integration by gandamu)\n\n- Clone MiDaS v3 specifically. This fixes 3D mode. It had been broken since MiDaS v3.1 introduced an incompatibility.\n\n## Notebook Provenance\n\nOriginal notebook by Katherine Crowson (https://github.com/crowsonkb, https://twitter.com/RiversHaveWings). It uses either OpenAI's 256x256 unconditional ImageNet or Katherine Crowson's fine-tuned 512x512 diffusion model (https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion), together with CLIP (https://github.com/openai/CLIP) to connect text prompts with images.\n\nModified by Daniel Russell (https://github.com/russelldc, https://twitter.com/danielrussruss) to include (hopefully) optimal params for quick generations in 15-100 timesteps rather than 1000, as well as more robust augmentations.\n\nFurther improvements from Dango233 and nshepperd helped improve the quality of diffusion in general, and especially so for shorter runs like this notebook aims to achieve.\n\nVark added code to load in multiple Clip models at once, which all prompts are evaluated against, which may greatly improve accuracy.\n\nThe latest zoom, pan, rotation, and keyframes features were taken from Chigozie Nri's VQGAN Zoom Notebook (https://github.com/chigozienri, https://twitter.com/chigozienri)\n\nAdvanced DangoCutn Cutout method is also from Dango223.\n\n--\n\nSomnai (https://twitter.com/Somnai_dreams) added 2D Diffusion animation techniques, QoL improvements and various implementations of tech and techniques, mostly listed in the changelog below.\n\n3D animation implementation added by Adam Letts (https://twitter.com/gandamu_ml) in collaboration with Somnai.\n\nTurbo feature by Chris Allen (https://twitter.com/zippy731)\n\nImprovements to ability to run on local systems, Windows support, and dependency installation by HostsServer (https://twitter.com/HostsServer)\n\nVR Mode by Tom Mason (https://twitter.com/nin_artificial)\n\nHorizontal and Vertical symmetry functionality by nshepperd. Symmetry transformation_steps by huemin (https://twitter.com/huemin_art). Symmetry integration into Disco Diffusion by Dmitrii Tochilkin (https://twitter.com/cut_pow).\n\nWarp and custom model support by Alex Spirin (https://twitter.com/devdef).\n\nPixel Art Diffusion, Watercolor Diffusion, and Pulp SciFi Diffusion models from KaliYuga (https://twitter.com/KaliYuga_ai). Follow KaliYuga's Twitter for the latest models and for notebooks with specialized settings.\n\nIntegration of OpenCLIP models and initiation of integration of KaliYuga models by Palmweaver / Chris Scalf (https://twitter.com/ChrisScalf11)\n\nIntegrated portrait_generator_v001 from Felipe3DArtist (https://twitter.com/Felipe3DArtist)\n\nMiDaS version tag fix by Steffen Moelter (a necessary fix for 3D animation mode after MiDaS v3.1 was introduced).\n",
