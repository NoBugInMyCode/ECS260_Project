Simply unzip the [package](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/releases/latest)\n2. Put the precompiled binary into your path\n3. Start using OWASP Amass!\n\n#### Homebrew\n\n```bash\nbrew tap owasp-amass/amass\nbrew install amass\n```\n\n### Docker Container\n\n1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)\n2. Pull the Docker image by running `docker pull caffix/amass`\n3. Run `docker run -v OUTPUT_DIR_PATH:/.config/amass/ caffix/amass enum -d example.com`\n\nThe volume argument allows the Amass graph database to persist between executions and output files to be accessed on the host system. The first field (left of the colon) of the volume option is the amass output directory that is external to Docker, while the second field is the path, internal to Docker, where amass will write the output files.\n\n### From Source\n\n1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and setup your Go workspace\n2. Download OWASP Amass by running `go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master`\n3. At this point, the binary should be in `$GOPATH/bin`\n\n## Documentation [![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4?utm_source=godoc)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4)\n\nUse the [Installation Guide](./doc/install.md) to get started.\n\nGo to the [User's Guide](./doc/user_guide.md) for additional information.\n\nSee the [Tutorial](./doc/tutorial.md) for example usage.\n\nSee the [Amass Scripting Engine Manual](./doc/scripting.md) for greater control over your enumeration process.\n\n## Corporate Supporters\n\n[![ZeroFox Logo](./images/zerofox_logo.png)](https://www.zerofox.com/) [![IPinfo Logo](./images/ipinfo_logo.png)](https://ipinfo.io/) [![WhoisXML API Logo](./images/whoisxmlapi_logo.png)](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/)\n\n## Testimonials\n\n### [![Accenture Logo](./images/accenture_logo.png) Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/)\n\n*\"Accenture\u2019s adversary simulation team has used Amass as our primary tool suite on a variety of external enumeration projects and attack surface assessments for clients. It\u2019s been an absolutely invaluable basis for infrastructure enumeration, and we\u2019re really grateful for all the hard work that\u2019s gone into making and maintaining it \u2013 it\u2019s made our job much easier!\"*\n\n\\- Max Deighton, Accenture Cyber Defense Manager\n\n### [![Visma Logo](./images/visma_logo.png) Visma](https://www.visma.com/)\n\n*\"For an internal red team, the organisational structure of Visma puts us against a unique challenge. Having sufficient, continuous visibility over our external attack surface is an integral part of being able to efficiently carry out our task. When dealing with hundreds of companies with different products and supporting infrastructure we need to always be on top of our game.*\n\n*For years, OWASP Amass has been a staple in the asset reconnaissance field, and keeps proving its worth time after time. The tool keeps constantly evolving and improving to adapt to the new trends in this area.\"*\n\n\\- Joona Hoikkala ([@joohoi](https://github.com/joohoi)) & Alexis Fern\u00e1ndez ([@six2dez](https://github.com/six2dez)), Visma Red Team\n\n## References [![DEF CON 30 Recon Village](https://img.shields.io/badge/defcon%2030-recon%20village-lightgrey.svg)](https://twitter.com/jeff_foley/status/1562246069278445568/photo/1) [![DEF CON 28 Red Team Village](https://img.shields.io/badge/defcon%2028-red%20team%20village-red.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/c/RedTeamVillage/featured) [![DEF CON 27 Demo Labs](https://img.shields.io/badge/defcon%2027-demo%20labs-purple.svg)](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-27/dc-27-demolabs.html) \n\nDid you write a blog post, magazine article or do a podcast about OWASP Amass?
