Read the [blog post](https://medium.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-v2-released-09a6033d1b10) and [try it out](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/getting-started/).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    SDK[\"OpenTelemetry SDK\"] --> |HTTP or gRPC| COLLECTOR\n    COLLECTOR[\"Jaeger Collector\"] --> STORE[Storage]\n    COLLECTOR --> |gRPC| PLUGIN[Storage Plugin]\n    COLLECTOR --> |gRPC/sampling| SDK\n    PLUGIN --> STORE\n    QUERY[Jaeger Query Service] --> STORE\n    QUERY --> |gRPC| PLUGIN\n    UI[Jaeger UI] --> |HTTP| QUERY\n    subgraph Application Host\n        subgraph User Application\n            SDK\n        end\n    end\n```\n\nJaeger is a distributed tracing platform created by [Uber Technologies](https://eng.uber.com/distributed-tracing/) and donated to [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io).\n\nSee Jaeger [documentation][doc] for getting started, operational details, and other information.\n\nJaeger is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as the 7th top-level project, graduated in October 2019. See the CNCF [Jaeger incubation announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/09/13/cncf-hosts-jaeger/) and [Jaeger graduation announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2019/10/31/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-jaeger-graduation/).\n\n## Get Involved\n\nJaeger is an open source project with open governance. We welcome contributions from the community, and we would love your help to improve and extend the project. Here are [some ideas](https://www.jaegertracing.io/get-involved/) for how to get involved. Many of them do not even require any coding.\n\n## Version Compatibility Guarantees\n\nSince Jaeger uses many components from the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/) we try to maintain configuration compatibility between Jaeger releases. Occasionally, configuration options in Jaeger (or in Jaeger v1 CLI flags) can be deprecated due to usability improvements, new functionality, or changes in our dependencies.\nIn such situations, developers introducing the deprecation are required to follow [these guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md#deprecating-cli-flags).\n\nIn short, for a deprecated configuration option, you should expect to see the following message in the documentation or release notes:\n```\n(deprecated, will be removed after yyyy-mm-dd or in release vX.Y.Z, whichever is later)\n```\n\nA grace period of at least **3 months** or **two minor version bumps** (whichever is later) from the first release\ncontaining the deprecation notice will be provided before the deprecated configuration option _can_ be deleted.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where v2.0.0 is released on 01-Sep-2024 containing a deprecation notice for a configuration option.\nThis configuration option will remain in a deprecated state until the later of 01-Dec-2024 or v2.2.0 where it _can_ be removed on or after either of those events.\nIt may remain deprecated for longer than the aforementioned grace period.\n\n## Go Version Compatibility Guarantees\n\nThe Jaeger project attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).\nRemoving support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.\n\nStarting with the release of Go 1.21, support for Go versions will be updated as follows:\n\n1. Soon after the release of a new Go minor version `N`, updates will be made to the build and tests steps to accommodate the latest Go minor version.\n2. Soon after the release of a new Go minor version `N`, support for Go version `N-2` will be removed and version `N-1` will become the minimum required version.\n\n## Related Repositories\n\n### Components\n\n * [UI](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui)\n * [Data model](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-idl)\n\n### Documentation\n\n  * Published: https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/\n  * Source: https://github.com/jaegertracing/documentation\n\n## Building From Source\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThanks to all the people who already contributed!\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contributors-img.web.app/image?repo=jaegertracing/jaeger\" />\n</a>\n\n### Maintainers\n\nRules for becoming a maintainer are defined in the [GOVERNANCE](./GOVERNANCE.md) document.\nThe official maintainers of the Jaeger project are listed in the [MAINTAINERS](./MAINTAINERS.md) file.\nPlease use `@jaegertracing/jaeger-maintainers` to tag them on issues / PRs.\n\nSome repositories under [jaegertracing](https://github.com/jaegertracing) org have additional maintainers.\n\n## Project Status Meetings\n\nThe Jaeger maintainers and contributors meet regularly on a video call. Everyone is welcome to join, including end users. For meeting details, see https://www.jaegertracing.io/get-in-touch/.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nSee https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/roadmap/\n\n## Get in Touch\n\nHave questions, suggestions, bug reports? Reach the project community via these channels:\n\n * [Slack chat room `#jaeger`][slack] (need to join [CNCF Slack][slack-join] for the first time)\n * [`jaeger-tracing` mail group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jaeger-tracing)\n * GitHub [issues](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/discussions)\n\n## Security\n\nThird-party security audits of Jaeger are available in https://github.com/jaegertracing/security-audits. Please see [Issue #1718](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1718) for the summary of available security mechanisms in Jaeger.\n\n## Adopters\n\nJaeger as a product consists of multiple components. We want to support different types of users,\nwhether they are only using our instrumentation libraries or full end to end Jaeger installation,\nwhether it runs in production or you use it to troubleshoot issues in development.\n\nPlease see [ADOPTERS.md](./ADOPTERS.md) for some of the organizations using Jaeger today.\nIf you would like to add your organization to the list, please comment on our\n[survey issue](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/207).\n\n## Sponsors\n\nThe Jaeger project owes its success in open source largely to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), our primary supporter. We deeply appreciate their vital support.  Furthermore, we are grateful to Uber for their initial, project-launching donation, and for the continuous contributions of software and infrastructure from 1Password, Codecov.io, Dosu, GitHub, Google Analytics, Netlify, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Thank you for your generous support.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) The Jaeger Authors.
