Light Table is very customizable and can display anything a [Chromium browser](http://www.chromium.org/) can.\n\n### This is a development branch and is not clean like `master` and can have many breakages.\n\n## Downloads\n\nPrebuilt binaries are available through [lighttable.com](http://lighttable.com). To build and use a developer version of Light Table [see these instructions](doc/developer-install.md).\n\nFor OSX users, the install process involves the following steps until we officially sign our OSX App:\n\n* In Finder, Ctrl-click on LightTable.app/ and select Open.\n* When you see [this prompt](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11994/11731454/85181e90-9f69-11e5-9c65-f6aa4228005c.png) about LightTable being unidentified, click Open.\n* If Ctrl-click doesn't work for you, open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, temporarily change \"Allow apps downloaded from:\" to Anywhere and double click on LightTable.app.\n\n## Documentation\n\n* See [docs.lighttable.com](http://docs.lighttable.com/) for official user documentation and tutorials.\n* See the [community wiki](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki) which includes a [User FAQ](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/FAQ) and a [For Users page](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/For-Users) for additional links.\n* For a typical Light Table workflow, [read this](doc/workflow.md).\n* To understand how Light Table works, read about its [BOT architecture](doc/BOT.md).\n* See [Light Table's API docs](http://lighttable.github.io/LightTable/api/index.html) to see what\n  plugin authors have access to.\n* If you're a user coming from vim or emacs see the [For Vim Users](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/For-Vim-Users) and [For Emacs Users](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/For-Emacs-Users) guides.\n\n## Plugins\n\nLight Table has a powerful plugin system that allows almost any aspect of the editor to be extended and customized. With over [100+ plugins](https://github.com/LightTable/plugin-metadata), the community is able to offer eval support for new languages, create domain-specific IDEs and much more. If you're interested in writing your own plugin, see the [Write a Plugin](http://docs.lighttable.com/#write-a-plugin) and [Submit a Plugin](http://docs.lighttable.com/#submit-a-plugin) docs. For an example ClojureScript plugin, see [LightTable-Declassifier](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable-Declassifier).\n\n## Community\n\nWant to ask a question or just say hi? Please do :). Our mailing list is the [Light Table Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/light-table-discussion). We also hang out in `#lighttable` on Freenode IRC.\n\n## For Developers\n\nLightTable is primarily written in [ClojureScript](http://clojure.org/clojurescript). If you aren't familiar with it, check out [David Nolen's tutorial](https://github.com/swannodette/lt-cljs-tutorial).\n\nIn order to develop for Light Table, you will need to [install a developer version of Light Table](doc/developer-install.md). For more information, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-contributions) and [For Developers](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/For-Developers).\n\n\n## License\n\nAll files in this project are under the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) license unless otherwise stated in the file or by a dependency's license file.\n\n## Credits\n\nBig thanks to all our [contributors](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/graphs/contributors)!\nThanks of course to Kodowa for all they have done for Light Table and also to Cognitect for providing friday contributions for one of the core team members.\n",
