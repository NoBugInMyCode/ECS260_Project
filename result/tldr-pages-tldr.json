Perhaps you're just a little rusty or can't always recall the arguments for commands like `lsof`, or `tar`?\n\nIt certainly doesn't help that, in the past, the first option explained in `man tar` was:\n\n```console\n$ man tar\n...\n-b blocksize\n   Specify the block size, in 512-byte records, for tape drive I/O.\n   As a rule, this argument is only needed when reading from or writing to tape drives,\n   and usually not even then as the default block size of 20 records (10240 bytes) is very common.\n...\n```\n\nThere is room for simpler help pages focused on practical examples.\nHow about:\n\n<picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/images/tldr-dark.png\">\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/images/tldr-light.png\">\n    <img alt=\"Screenshot of the tldr client displaying the tar command.\" src=\"https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/images/tldr-dark.png\">\n</picture>\n\nThis repository is just that: an ever-growing collection of examples\nfor the most common UNIX, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,\nSunOS, Android, and Windows command-line tools.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\n> [!TIP]\n> For browsing without installing a client on your computer,\n> see the web client at <https://tldr.inbrowser.app> (with offline support using PWA).\n\nA popular and convenient way to access these pages on your computer\nis to install the official [Node.js client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-node-client):\n\n```shell\nnpm install -g tldr\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the official [Python client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-python-client), which can be installed via [pip3](https://pypi.org/project/tldr/) (or [other package managers](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-python-client#installation)):\n\n```shell\npip3 install tldr\n```\n\nLinux and Mac users can also install the official [Rust Client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tlrc) using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tlrc)\n(or [other package managers](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tlrc#installation) on other operating systems):\n\n```shell\nbrew install tlrc\n```\n\nThen you have direct access to simplified, easy-to-read help for commands, such as `tar`,\naccessible through typing `tldr tar` instead of the standard `man tar`.\n\nIf you don't want to install any software, check out the [PDF version](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/releases/latest/download/tldr-book.pdf) instead.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> PDFs for translations are available for most languages. You can find them in the release assets of the [latest release](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/releases/latest).\n\nThere are also **various other clients** provided by the community,\nboth for the command-line and for other platforms.\nFor a comprehensive list of clients, head over to our [Wiki](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/wiki/Clients).\n\n## How do I contribute to tldr-pages?\n\nAll contributions are welcome!\n\nSome ways to contribute include:\n\n- Adding your favorite command that isn't covered.\n- Adding examples or improving the content of an existing page.\n- Adding requested pages from our issues with the [help wanted](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) label.\n- Translating pages into different languages.\n\nAll `tldr` pages are written in Markdown so that they can be edited quite easily and changes can be submitted in\npull requests here using Git on the command-line or\nusing the GitHub web interface.\n\nWe strive to maintain a [welcoming and collaborative](GOVERNANCE.md) community.\nIf it's your first time contributing, have a look at the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md), and go ahead!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to translations, you can visit <https://lukwebsforge.github.io/tldri18n/>\nto see the overall progress of all translations, and which translations are missing or outdated.\n\nYou are also welcome to join us on the [matrix chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#tldr-pages:matrix.org)!\n\n## Similar projects\n\n- [Command Line Interface Pages](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages)\n  allows you to write standardized help pages for CLI, directories, and configs.\n\n- [Cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat)\n  allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the command-line.\n  It was designed to help remind Unix system administrators of options\n  for commands that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to remember.\n\n- [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh/)\n  Aggregates cheat sheets from multiple sources (including tldr-pages)\n  into 1 unified interface.\n\n- [devhints](https://devhints.io/)\n  Rico's cheatsheets are not just focused on the command-line and\n  include a plethora of other cheatsheets related to programming.\n\n- [eg](https://github.com/srsudar/eg)\n  provides detailed examples with explanations on the command-line.\n  Examples come from the repository, but `eg` supports displaying\n  custom examples and commands alongside the defaults.\n  \n- [kb](https://github.com/gnebbia/kb)\n  is a minimalist command-line knowledge base manager.\n  kb can be used to organize your notes and cheatsheets in a minimalist\n  and clean way. It also supports non-text files.\n\n- [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi)\n  is an interactive cheatsheet tool, which allows you to browse through\n  specific examples or complete commands on the fly.\n\n- [bropages (deprecated)](http://bropages.org)\n  are a highly readable supplement to man pages.\n  It shows concise, common-case examples for Unix commands.\n  The examples are submitted by the user base, and can be voted up or down;\n  the best entries are what people see first when they look up a command.\n\n## What does \"tldr\" mean?\n\nTL;DR stands for \"Too Long; Didn't Read\".\nIt originated as Internet slang, where it is used to indicate that a long text\n(or parts of it) has been skipped as too lengthy.\nRead more in How-To Geek's [article](https://www.howtogeek.com/435266/what-does-tldr-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it/).\n",
