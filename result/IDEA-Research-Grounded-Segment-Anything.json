code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.\n\n### Install with Docker\n\nOpen one terminal:\n\n```\nmake build-image\n```\n\n```\nmake run\n```\n\nThat's it.\n\nIf you would like to allow visualization across docker container, open another terminal and type:\n\n```\nxhost +\n```\n\n\n### Install without Docker\nYou should set the environment variable manually as follows if you want to build a local GPU environment for Grounded-SAM:\n```bash\nexport AM_I_DOCKER=False\nexport BUILD_WITH_CUDA=True\nexport CUDA_HOME=/path/to/cuda-11.3/\n```\n\nInstall Segment Anything:\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install -e segment_anything\n```\n\nInstall Grounding DINO:\n\n```bash\npip install --no-build-isolation -e GroundingDINO\n```\n\n\nInstall diffusers:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade diffusers[torch]\n```\n\nInstall osx:\n\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\ncd grounded-sam-osx && bash install.sh\n```\n\nInstall RAM & Tag2Text:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/xinyu1205/recognize-anything.git\npip install -r ./recognize-anything/requirements.txt\npip install -e ./recognize-anything/\n```\n\nThe following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.\n\n```\npip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx ipykernel\n```\n\nMore details can be found in [install segment anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#installation) and [install GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO#install) and [install OSX](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/OSX)\n\n\n## Grounded-SAM Playground\nLet's start exploring our Grounding-SAM Playground and we will release more interesting demos in the future, stay tuned!\n\n## :open_book: Step-by-Step Notebook Demo\nHere we list some notebook demo provided in this project:\n- [grounded_sam.ipynb](grounded_sam.ipynb)\n- [grounded_sam_colab_demo.ipynb](grounded_sam_colab_demo.ipynb)\n- [grounded_sam_3d_box.ipynb](grounded_sam_3d_box)\n\n\n### :running_man: GroundingDINO: Detect Everything with Text Prompt\n\n:grapes: [[arXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499)] &nbsp; :rose:[[Try the Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/zero-shot-object-detection-with-grounding-dino.ipynb)] &nbsp; :sunflower: [[Try Huggingface Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ShilongLiu/Grounding_DINO_demo)] &nbsp; :mushroom: [[Automated Dataset Annotation and Evaluation](https://youtu.be/C4NqaRBz_Kw)]\n\nHere's the step-by-step tutorial on running `GroundingDINO` demo:\n\n**Step 1: Download the pretrained weights**\n\n```bash\ncd Grounded-Segment-Anything\n\n# download the pretrained groundingdino-swin-tiny model\nwget https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth\n```\n\n**Step 2: Running the demo**\n\n```bash\npython grounding_dino_demo.py\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary> <b> Running with Python (same as demo but you can run it anywhere after installing GroundingDINO) </b> </summary>\n\n```python\nfrom groundingdino.util.inference import load_model, load_image, predict, annotate\nimport cv2\n\nmodel = load_model(\"GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py\", \"./groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth\")\nIMAGE_PATH = \"assets/demo1.jpg\"\nTEXT_PROMPT = \"bear.\"\nBOX_THRESHOLD = 0.35\nTEXT_THRESHOLD = 0.25\n\nimage_source, image = load_image(IMAGE_PATH)\n\nboxes, logits, phrases = predict(\n    model=model,\n    image=image,\n    caption=TEXT_PROMPT,\n    box_threshold=BOX_THRESHOLD,\n    text_threshold=TEXT_THRESHOLD\n)\n\nannotated_frame = annotate(image_source=image_source, boxes=boxes, logits=logits, phrases=phrases)\ncv2.imwrite(\"annotated_image.jpg\", annotated_frame)\n```\n\n</details>\n<br>\n\n**Tips**\n- If you want to detect multiple objects in one sentence with [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO), we suggest separating each name with `.` .

Run in the notebook, just click for annotating points for further segmentation. Enjoy it! \n\n\n- Release human-face-edit branch [here](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything/tree/humanFace). We'll keep updating this branch with more interesting features. Here are some examples:\n\n  ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything/blob/humanFace/assets/231-hair-edit.png)\n\n## :camera: 3D-Box via Segment Anything\nWe extend the scope to 3D world by combining Segment Anything and [VoxelNeXt](https://github.com/dvlab-research/VoxelNeXt). When we provide a prompt (e.g., a point / box), the result is not only 2D segmentation mask, but also 3D boxes. Please check [voxelnext_3d_box](./voxelnext_3d_box/) for more details.\n  ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything/blob/main/voxelnext_3d_box/images/sam-voxelnext.png)\n  ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything/blob/main/voxelnext_3d_box/images/image_boxes2.png)\n\n\n\n\n## :cupid: Acknowledgements\n\n- [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)\n- [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO)\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nOur project wouldn't be possible without the contributions of these amazing people!
