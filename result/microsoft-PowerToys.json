Besides  coding features / bug fixes,  other ways to assist include spec writing, design, documentation, and finding bugs. We are excited to work with the power user community to build a set of tools for helping you get the most out of Windows.\n\nWe ask that **before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute**, please read our [Contributor's Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). We would be happy to work with you to figure out the best approach, provide guidance and mentorship throughout feature development, and help avoid any wasted or duplicate effort.\n\nMost contributions require you to agree to a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][oss-CLA] declaring that you grant us the rights to use your contribution and that you have permission to do so.\n\nFor guidance on developing for PowerToys, please read the [developer docs](/doc/devdocs) for a detailed breakdown.
