It allows users to peek into a file content in lightning speed by just pressing the <kbd>Space</kbd> key. Windows, on the other hand, does not have this handy feature ... until now!\n\nI am aware that several alternatives are already available on the Internet (e.g. [WinQuickLook](https://github.com/shibayan/WinQuickLook) and [Seer](https://github.com/ccseer/Seer)). Despite these options, I still decided to craft another one by myself, because they are either not being actively developed, lack of variety, or ask for some :dollar:.\n\n## Highlights\n\n - Tons of supported file types (full list [here](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Supported-File-Types))\n - Fluent design\n - Touchscreen friendly\n - HiDPI support\n - Preview from *Open* and *Save File* Dialog\n - Preview from 3rd-party file managers (see a list [here](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/File-Managers))\n - Easily extended by [plugins](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Available-Plugins)\n - Strict GPL license to keep it free forever\n\n## Usage\n\n### Download/Installation\n\nGet it from one of the following sources:\n\n  * Microsoft Store (Windows 10 users only, no preview in open/save-dialogs available) <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nv4bs3l1h4s?ocid=badge\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/store/badges/images/English_get_L.png\" height=\"22px\" alt=\"Store Link\" /></a> \n  * Installer or portable archive of the stable version from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/releases)\n  * Using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/): `scoop bucket add extras && scoop install extras/quicklook`\n  * Nightly builds from [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/xupefei/quicklook/build/artifacts) and [GitHub Action](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/releases/)\n\n[What are the differences between `.msi`, `.zip`, Nightly and Store versions?](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Differences-Between-Distributions)\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to check out the [plugins](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Available-Plugins) for previewing office-files, epubs, fonts and more!\n\n\n### Typical usecase\n\n1. Run `QuickLook.exe` (only necessary if autostart is disabled)\n1. Select any file or folder (on the Desktop, in a File Explorer window, in an *Open* or *Save-File* dialogue, doesn't matter)\n1. Press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>\n1. Enjoy the preview and interact with it\n1. Preview next file by clicking on it or using arrow-keys (arrow-keys move selection in the background if the preview window is not in focus)\n1. When you're done close it by either hitting <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> again, pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> or clicking the `\u2a09` button\n\n### Hotkeys and buttons\n\n - <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> Show/Hide the preview window\n - <kbd>Esc</kbd> Hide the preview window\n - <kbd>Enter</kbd> Open/Execute current file\n - <kbd>Mouse</kbd> <kbd>\u2191</kbd> <kbd>\u2193</kbd> <kbd>\u2190</kbd> <kbd>\u2192</kbd> Preview another file\n - <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> Zoom in/out (images)\n - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> Zoom in/out (PDFs)\n - <kbd>Wheel</kbd> Increase/decrease volume\n\n## Supported file types, file manager integration, etc.\n\nSee the [Wiki page](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki)\n\n## Translations\n\nSee the [Translation guide](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Translations)\n\n## Developer\n\n- **Formatter**: [CodeMaid.config](CodeMaid.config), [Settings.XamlStyler](Settings.XamlStyler)\n\n## Thanks to\n\n - Many [open-source projects](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/On-the-Shoulders-of-Giants) and their contributors\n - Our UI designers [@OiCkilL](https://twitter.com/OiCkilL) (\u201cFluent\u201d user interface since v0.3), [@QubitsDev](https://twitter.com/qubitsdev) (app-icon v0.3-v3.6.9) and [Donno](https://github.com/Donnnno) (app-icon since v3.6.10)\n - [Our contributers](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/graphs/contributors) who\n     - teach QuickLook to speak *your* language\n     - send pull requests, report bugs or give suggestions\n - ... and you \ud83d\ude0a\n\n## Licenses\n\n![GPL-v3](https://www.gnu.org/graphics/gplv3-127x51.png)\n\nThis project references many other open-source projects.
