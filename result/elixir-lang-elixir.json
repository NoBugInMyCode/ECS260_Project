For more\ninformation, please read our [Security Policy][9].\n\nAll interactions in our official communication channels follow our\n[Code of Conduct][1].\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFor reporting bugs, [visit our issue tracker][2] and follow the steps\nfor reporting a new issue. **Please disclose security vulnerabilities\nprivately at <elixir-security@googlegroups.com>**.\n\n## Issues tracker management\n\nAll currently open bugs related to the Elixir repository are listed\nin the issues tracker. The Elixir team uses the issues tracker to focus\non *actionable items*, including planned enhancements in the short and\nmedium term. We also do our best to label entries for clarity and to ease\ncollaboration.\n\nOur *actionable item policy* has some important consequences, such as:\n\n  * Proposing new features as well as requests for support, help, and\n    guidance must be done in their own spaces, detailed next.\n\n  * Issues we have identified to be outside of Elixir's scope,\n    such as an upstream bug, will be closed (and requested to be moved\n    elsewhere if appropriate).\n\n  * We actively close unrelated and non-actionable issues to keep the\n    issues tracker tidy. We may get things wrong from time to\n    time and will gladly revisit issues, reopening when necessary.\n\nKeep the tone positive and be kind! For more information, see the\n[Code of Conduct][1].\n\n### Proposing new features\n\nFor proposing new features, please start a discussion in the\n[Elixir Core mailing list][3]. The [language development history and\nits focus are described on our website](https://elixir-lang.org/development.html).\n\nKeep in mind that it is your responsibility to argue and explain\nwhy a feature is useful and how it will impact the codebase and\nthe community. A good proposal includes the problem description\nand how the proposed solution compares with existing alternatives\nin the Elixir ecosystem (as well as in other languages). To iron\nout a proposal before submission, consider using and gathering\nfeedback from the community spaces [listed on the sidebar of the\nElixir website](https://elixir-lang.org/).\n\nOnce a proposal is accepted, it will be added to [the issue tracker][2].\nFeatures and bug fixes that have already been merged and will be included\nin the next release are then \"closed\" and added to the [changelog][7].\n\n### Discussions, support, and help\n\nFor general discussions, support, and help, please use the community\nspaces [listed on the sidebar of the Elixir website](https://elixir-lang.org/),\nsuch as forums, chat platforms, etc, where the wider community will be available\nto help you.\n\n## Compiling from source\n\nFor the many different ways to install Elixir,\n[see our installation instructions on the website](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).\nHowever, if you want to contribute to Elixir, you will need to compile from source.\n\nFirst, [install Erlang](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#installing-erlang).\nAfter that, clone this repository to your machine, compile and test it:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir.git\ncd elixir\nmake\n```\n\n> Note: if you are running on Windows,\n[this article includes important notes for compiling Elixir from source\non Windows](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/wiki/Windows).\n\nIn case you want to use this Elixir version as your system version,\nyou need to add the `bin` directory to [your PATH environment variable](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#setting-path-environment-variable).\n\nWhen updating the repository, you may want to run `make clean` before\nrecompiling. For deterministic builds, you should set the environment\nvariable `ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=deterministic`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe invite contributions to Elixir. To contribute, there are a few\nthings you need to know about the code. First, Elixir code is divided\nby each application inside the `lib` folder:\n\n  * `elixir` - Elixir's kernel and standard library\n\n  * `eex` - EEx is the template engine that allows you to embed Elixir\n\n  * `ex_unit` - ExUnit is a simple test framework that ships with Elixir\n\n  * `iex` - IEx stands for Interactive Elixir: Elixir's interactive shell\n\n  * `logger` - Logger is the built-in logger\n\n  * `mix` - Mix is Elixir's build tool\n\nYou can run all tests in the root directory with `make test`. You can\nalso run tests for a specific framework with `make test_#{APPLICATION}`, for example,\n`make test_ex_unit`. If you just changed something in Elixir's standard\nlibrary, you can run only that portion through `make test_stdlib`.\n\nIf you are only changing one file, you can choose to compile and run tests\nfor that specific file for faster development cycles. For example, if you\nare changing the String module, you can compile it and run its tests as:\n\n```sh\nbin/elixirc lib/elixir/lib/string.ex -o lib/elixir/ebin\nbin/elixir lib/elixir/test/elixir/string_test.exs\n```\n\nSome test files need their `test_helper.exs` to be explicitly required\nbefore, such as:\n\n```sh\nbin/elixir -r lib/logger/test/test_helper.exs lib/logger/test/logger_test.exs\n```\n\nYou can also use the `LINE` env var to run a single test:\n\n```sh\nLINE=123 bin/elixir lib/elixir/test/elixir/string_test.exs\n````\n\nTo recompile all (including Erlang modules):\n\n```sh\nmake compile\n```\n\nAfter your changes are done, please remember to run `make format` to guarantee\nall files are properly formatted, then run the full suite with\n`make test`.\n\nIf your contribution fails during the bootstrapping of the language,\nyou can rebuild the language from scratch with:\n\n```sh\nmake clean_elixir compile\n```\n\nSimilarly, if you can not get Elixir to compile or the tests to pass after\nupdating an existing checkout, run `make clean compile`. You can check\n[the official build status](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/actions/workflows/ci.yml).\nMore tasks can be found by reading the [Makefile](Makefile).\n\nWith tests running and passing, you are ready to contribute to Elixir and\n[send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\nWe have saved some excellent pull requests we have received in the past in\ncase you are looking for some examples:\n\n  * [Implement Enum.member? - Pull request](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/992)\n  * [Add String.valid? - Pull request](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/1058)\n  * [Implement capture_io for ExUnit - Pull request](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/1059)\n\n### Reviewing changes\n\nOnce a pull request is sent, the Elixir team will review your changes.\nWe outline our process below to clarify the roles of everyone involved.\n\nAll pull requests must be approved by two committers before being merged into\nthe repository. If changes are necessary, the team will leave appropriate\ncomments requesting changes to the code. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee a\npull request will be merged, even when modifications are requested, as the Elixir\nteam will re-evaluate the contribution as it changes.\n\nCommitters may also push style changes directly to your branch. If you would\nrather manage all changes yourself, you can disable the \"Allow edits from maintainers\"\nfeature when submitting your pull request.\n\nThe Elixir team may optionally assign someone to review a pull request.\nIf someone is assigned, they must explicitly approve the code before\nanother team member can merge it.\n\nWhen the review finishes, your pull request will be squashed and merged\ninto the repository. If you have carefully organized your commits and\nbelieve they should be merged without squashing, please mention it in\na comment.\n\n## Building documentation\n\nBuilding the documentation requires that [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)\nis installed and built alongside Elixir:\n\n```sh\n# After cloning and compiling Elixir, in its parent directory:\ngit clone https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc.git\ncd ex_doc && ../elixir/bin/elixir ../elixir/bin/mix do deps.get + compile\n```\n\nNow go back to Elixir's root directory and run:\n\n```sh\nmake docs                  # to generate HTML pages\nmake docs DOCS_FORMAT=epub # to generate EPUB documents\n```\n\nThis will produce documentation sets for `elixir`, `eex`, `ex_unit`, `iex`, `logger`,\nand `mix` under the `doc` directory. If you are planning to contribute documentation,\n[please check our best practices for writing documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/writing-documentation.html).\n\n## Development links\n\n  * [Elixir Documentation][6]\n  * [Elixir Core Mailing list (development)][3]\n  * [Announcement mailing list][8]\n  * [Code of Conduct][1]\n  * [Issue tracker][2]\n  * [Changelog][7]\n  * [Security Policy][9]\n  * **[#elixir][4]** on [Libera.Chat][5] IRC\n\n  [1]: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n  [2]: https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues\n  [3]: https://groups.google.com/group/elixir-lang-core\n  [4]: https://web.libera.chat/#elixir\n  [5]: https://libera.chat\n  [6]: https://elixir-lang.org/docs.html\n  [7]: CHANGELOG.md\n  [8]: https://groups.google.com/group/elixir-lang-ann\n  [9]: SECURITY.md\n  [10]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/elixir-lang-ann/%5Bsecurity%5D%7Csort:date\n\n## License\n\n\"Elixir\" and the Elixir logo are registered trademarks of The Elixir Team.\n\nElixir source code is released under Apache License 2.0.\n\nCheck [NOTICE](NOTICE) and [LICENSE](LICENSE) files for more information.\n",
