Please check out a tagged version\nbefore compiling production binaries.**\n\nFor internationalized documentation, see the index at [doc/intl](doc/intl/README.md).\n\nDogecoin is a community-driven cryptocurrency that was inspired by a Shiba Inu meme. The Dogecoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Dogecoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Bitcoin Core and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor information about the default fees used on the Dogecoin network, please\nrefer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).\n\n## Usage \ud83d\udcbb\n\nTo start your journey with Dogecoin Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.\n\nThe JSON-RPC API provided by Dogecoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `dogecoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `dogecoin-cli help <command>`.\n\n### Such ports\n\nDogecoin Core by default uses port `22556` for peer-to-peer communication that\nis needed to synchronize the \"mainnet\" blockchain and stay informed of new\ntransactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which\ndefaults to port `22555` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not\nexpose RPC ports to the public internet.\n\n| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |\n| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |\n| P2P      |   22556 |   44556 |   18444 |\n| RPC      |   22555 |   44555 |   18332 |\n\n## Ongoing development - Moon plan \ud83c\udf12\n\nDogecoin Core is an open source and community driven software. The development\nprocess is open and publicly visible; anyone can see, discuss and work on the\nsoftware.\n\nMain development resources:\n\n* [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/projects) is used to\n  follow planned and in-progress work for upcoming releases.\n* [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/discussions) is used\n  to discuss features, planned and unplanned, related to both the development of\n  the Dogecoin Core software, the underlying protocols and the DOGE asset.\n\n### Version strategy\nVersion numbers are following ```major.minor.patch``` semantics.\n\n### Branches\nThere are 4 types of branches in this repository:\n\n- **master:** Unstable, contains the latest code under development.\n- **maintenance:** Stable, contains the latest version of previous releases,\n  which are still under active maintenance. Format: ```<version>-maint```\n- **development:** Unstable, contains new code for upcoming releases. Format: ```<version>-dev```\n- **archive:** Stable, immutable branches for old versions that no longer change\n  because they are no longer maintained.\n\n***Submit your pull requests against `master`***\n\n*Maintenance branches are exclusively mutable by release. When a release is*\n*planned, a development branch will be created and commits from master will*\n*be cherry-picked into these by maintainers.*\n\n## Contributing \ud83e\udd1d\n\nIf you find a bug or experience issues with this software, please report it\nusing the [issue system](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5Bbug%5D+).\n\nPlease see [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how you can\nparticipate in the development of Dogecoin Core. There are often\n[topics seeking help](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/labels/help%20wanted)\nwhere your contributions will have high impact and get very appreciation. wow.\n\n## Very Much Frequently Asked Questions \u2753\n\nDo you have a question regarding Dogecoin? An answer is perhaps already in the\n[FAQ](doc/FAQ.md) or the\n[Q&A section](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/discussions/categories/q-a)\nof the discussion board!\n\n## License - Much license \u2696\ufe0f\nDogecoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license.
