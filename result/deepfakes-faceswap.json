It was also completely ignored outside of academia because the code was confusing and fragmentary. It required a thorough understanding of complicated AI techniques and took a lot of effort to figure it out. Until one individual brought it together into a single, cohesive collection. It ran, it worked, and as is so often the way with new technology emerging on the internet, it was immediately used to create inappropriate content. Despite the inappropriate uses the software was given originally, it was the first AI code that anyone could download, run and learn by experimentation without having a Ph.D. in math, computer theory, psychology, and more. Before \"deepfakes\" these techniques were like black magic, only practiced by those who could understand all of the inner workings as described in esoteric and endlessly complicated books and papers.\n\n\"Deepfakes\" changed all that and anyone could participate in AI development. To us, developers, the release of this code opened up a fantastic learning opportunity. It allowed us to build on ideas developed by others, collaborate with a variety of skilled coders, experiment with AI whilst learning new skills and ultimately contribute towards an emerging technology which will only see more mainstream use as it progresses.\n\nAre there some out there doing horrible things with similar software? Yes. And because of this, the developers have been following strict ethical standards. Many of us don't even use it to create videos, we just tinker with the code to see what it does. Sadly, the media concentrates only on the unethical uses of this software. That is, unfortunately, the nature of how it was first exposed to the public, but it is not representative of why it was created, how we use it now, or what we see in its future. Like any technology, it can be used for good or it can be abused. It is our intention to develop FaceSwap in a way that its potential for abuse is minimized whilst maximizing its potential as a tool for learning, experimenting and, yes, for legitimate faceswapping.\n\nWe are not trying to denigrate celebrities or to demean anyone. We are programmers, we are engineers, we are Hollywood VFX artists, we are activists, we are hobbyists, we are human beings. To this end, we feel that it's time to come out with a standard statement of what this software is and isn't as far as us developers are concerned.\n\n- FaceSwap is not for creating inappropriate content.\n- FaceSwap is not for changing faces without consent or with the intent of hiding its use.\n- FaceSwap is not for any illicit, unethical, or questionable purposes.\n- FaceSwap exists to experiment and discover AI techniques, for social or political commentary, for movies, and for any number of ethical and reasonable uses.\n\nWe are very troubled by the fact that FaceSwap can be used for unethical and disreputable things. However, we support the development of tools and techniques that can be used ethically as well as provide education and experience in AI for anyone who wants to learn it hands-on. We will take a zero tolerance approach to anyone using this software for any unethical purposes and will actively discourage any such uses.\n\n# How To setup and run the project\nFaceSwap is a Python program that will run on multiple Operating Systems including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.\n\nSee [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for full installation instructions. You will need a modern GPU with CUDA support for best performance. Many AMD GPUs are supported through DirectML (Windows) and ROCm (Linux).\n\n# Overview\nThe project has multiple entry points. You will have to:\n - Gather photos and/or videos\n - **Extract** faces from your raw photos\n - **Train** a model on the faces extracted from the photos/videos\n - **Convert** your sources with the model\n\nCheck out [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for more detailed instructions.\n\n## Extract\nFrom your setup folder, run `python faceswap.py extract`. This will take photos from `src` folder and extract faces into `extract` folder.\n\n## Train\nFrom your setup folder, run `python faceswap.py train`. This will take photos from two folders containing pictures of both faces and train a model that will be saved inside the `models` folder.\n\n## Convert\nFrom your setup folder, run `python faceswap.py convert`. This will take photos from `original` folder and apply new faces into `modified` folder.\n\n## GUI\nAlternatively, you can run the GUI by running `python faceswap.py gui`\n\n# General notes:\n- All of the scripts mentioned have `-h`/`--help` options with arguments that they will accept. You're smart, you can figure out how this works, right?!\n\nNB: there is a conversion tool for video. This can be accessed by running `python tools.py effmpeg -h`. Alternatively, you can use [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) to convert video into photos, process images, and convert images back to the video.\n\n\n**Some tips:**\n\nReusing existing models will train much faster than starting from nothing.\nIf there is not enough training data, start with someone who looks similar, then switch the data.\n\n# Help I need support!\n## Discord Server\nYour best bet is to join the [FaceSwap Discord server](https://discord.gg/FC54sYg) where there are plenty of users willing to help. Please note that, like this repo, this is a SFW Server!\n\n## FaceSwap Forum\nAlternatively, you can post questions in the [FaceSwap Forum](https://faceswap.dev/forum). Please do not post general support questions in this repo as they are liable to be deleted without response.\n\n# Donate\nThe developers work tirelessly to improve and develop FaceSwap. Many hours have been put in to provide the software as it is today, but this is an extremely time-consuming process with no financial reward. If you enjoy using the software, please consider donating to the devs, so they can spend more time implementing improvements.\n\n## Patreon\nThe best way to support us is through our Patreon page:\n\n[![become-a-patron](https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png)](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=23238350)\n\n## One time Donations\nAlternatively you can give a one off donation to any of our Devs:\n### @torzdf\n There is very little FaceSwap code that hasn't been touched by torzdf. He is responsible for implementing the GUI, FAN aligner, MTCNN detector and porting the Villain, DFL-H128 and DFaker models to FaceSwap, as well as significantly improving many areas of the code.\n\n**Bitcoin:** bc1qpm22suz59ylzk0j7qk5e4c7cnkjmve2rmtrnc6\n\n**Ethereum:** 0xd3e954dC241B87C4E8E1A801ada485DC1d530F01\n\n**Monero:** 45dLrtQZ2pkHizBpt3P3yyJKkhcFHnhfNYPMSnz3yVEbdWm3Hj6Kr5TgmGAn3Far8LVaQf1th2n3DJVTRkfeB5ZkHxWozSX\n\n**Paypal:** [![torzdf](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=JZ8PP3YE9J62L)\n\n### @andenixa\nCreator of the Unbalanced and OHR models, as well as expanding various capabilities within the training process.

Also feel free to add your own alternatives/improvements\n\n## For non-dev advanced users\n - Read this README entirely\n - Clone the repo\n - Play with it\n - Check issues with the 'advuser' tag\n - Also go to the '[faceswap Forum](https://faceswap.dev/forum)' and help others.\n\n## For end-users\n - Get the code here and play with it if you can\n - You can also go to the [faceswap Forum](https://faceswap.dev/forum) and help or get help from others.\n - Be patient. This is a relatively new technology for developers as well. Much effort is already being put into making this program easy to use for the average user. It just takes time!\n - **Notice** Any issue related to running the code has to be opened in the [faceswap Forum](https://faceswap.dev/forum)!\n\n# About machine learning\n\n## How does a computer know how to recognize/shape faces? How does machine learning work? What is a neural network?\nIt's complicated. Here's a good video that makes the process understandable:\n[![How Machines Learn](https://img.youtube.com/vi/R9OHn5ZF4Uo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo)\n\nHere's a slightly more in depth video that tries to explain the basic functioning of a neural network:\n[![How Machines Learn](https://img.youtube.com/vi/aircAruvnKk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)\n\ntl;dr: training data + trial and error\n",
