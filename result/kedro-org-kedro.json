It uses software engineering best practices to help you create data engineering and data science pipelines that are reproducible, maintainable, and modular. You can find out more at [kedro.org](https://kedro.org).\n\nKedro is an open-source Python framework hosted by the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/).\n\n## How do I install Kedro?\n\nTo install Kedro from the Python Package Index (PyPI) run:\n\n```\npip install kedro\n```\n\nIt is also possible to install Kedro using `conda`:\n\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge kedro\n```\n\nOur [Get Started guide](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/get_started/install.html) contains full installation instructions, and includes how to set up Python virtual environments.\n\n### Installation from source\nTo access the latest Kedro version before its official release, install it from the `main` branch.\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro@main\n```\n\n## What are the main features of Kedro?\n\n| Feature              | What is this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| -------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Project Template     | A standard, modifiable and easy-to-use project template based on [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Data Catalog         | A series of lightweight data connectors used to save and load data across many different file formats and file systems, including local and network file systems, cloud object stores, and HDFS.

We also recommend the [API reference documentation](/kedro) for further information.\n\n\n## Why does Kedro exist?\n\nKedro is built upon our collective best-practice (and mistakes) trying to deliver real-world ML applications that have vast amounts of raw unvetted data. We developed Kedro to achieve the following:\n\n- To address the main shortcomings of Jupyter notebooks, one-off scripts, and glue-code because there is a focus on\n  creating **maintainable data science code**\n- To enhance **team collaboration** when different team members have varied exposure to software engineering concepts\n- To increase efficiency, because applied concepts like modularity and separation of concerns inspire the creation of\n  **reusable analytics code**\n\nFind out more about how Kedro can answer your use cases from the [product FAQs on the Kedro website](https://kedro.org/#faq).\n\n## The humans behind Kedro\n\nThe [Kedro product team](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/contribution/technical_steering_committee.html#kedro-maintainers) and a number of [open source contributors from across the world](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/releases) maintain Kedro.\n\n## Can I contribute?\n\nYes! We welcome all kinds of contributions. Check out our [guide to contributing to Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/wiki/Contribute-to-Kedro).\n\n## Where can I learn more?\n\nThere is a growing community around Kedro. We encourage you to ask and answer technical questions on [Slack](https://slack.kedro.org/) and bookmark the [Linen archive of past discussions](https://linen-slack.kedro.org/).\n\nWe keep a list of [technical FAQs in the Kedro documentation](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/faq/faq.html) and you can find a  growing list of blog posts, videos and projects that use Kedro over on the [`awesome-kedro` GitHub repository](https://github.com/kedro-org/awesome-kedro). If you have created anything with Kedro we'd love to include it on the list. Just make a PR to add it!\n\n## How can I cite Kedro?\n\nIf you're an academic, Kedro can also help you, for example, as a tool to solve the problem of reproducible research. Use the \"Cite this repository\" button on [our repository](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro) to generate a citation from the [CITATION.cff file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files).\n\n## Python version support policy\n* The core [Kedro Framework](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro) supports all Python versions that are actively maintained by the CPython core team. When a [Python version reaches end of life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#versions), support for that version is dropped from Kedro. This is not considered a breaking change.\n* The [Kedro Datasets](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins/tree/main/kedro-datasets) package follows the [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html) Python version support policy. This means that `kedro-datasets` generally drops Python version support before `kedro`. This is because `kedro-datasets` has a lot of dependencies that follow NEP 29 and the more conservative version support approach of the Kedro Framework makes it hard to manage those dependencies properly.\n\n\n## \u2615\ufe0f Kedro Coffee Chat \ud83d\udd36\n\nWe appreciate our community and want to stay connected. For that, we offer a public Coffee Chat format where we share updates and cool stuff around Kedro once every two weeks and give you time to ask your questions live.\n\nCheck out the upcoming demo topics and dates at the [Kedro Coffee Chat wiki page](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/wiki/Kedro-Coffee-Chat).\n\nFollow our Slack [announcement channel](https://kedro-org.slack.com/archives/C03RKAQ0MGQ) to see Kedro Coffee Chat announcements and access demo recordings.\n",
