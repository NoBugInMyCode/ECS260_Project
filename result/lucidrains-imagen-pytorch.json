It is the new SOTA for text-to-image synthesis.\n\nArchitecturally, it is actually much simpler than DALL-E2. It consists of a cascading DDPM conditioned on text embeddings from a large pretrained T5 model (attention network). It also contains dynamic clipping for improved classifier free guidance, noise level conditioning, and a memory efficient unet design.\n\nIt appears neither CLIP nor prior network is needed after all. And so research continues.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqDeAz0U-R4\">AI Coffee Break with Letitia</a> | <a href=\"https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-imagen-actually-works/\">Assembly AI</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af6WPqvzjjk\">Yannic Kilcher</a>\n\nPlease join <a href=\"https://discord.gg/xBPBXfcFHd\"><img alt=\"Join us on Discord\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/823813159592001537?color=5865F2&logo=discord&logoColor=white\"></a> if you are interested in helping out with the replication with the <a href=\"https://laion.ai/\">LAION</a> community\n\n## Shoutouts\n\n- <a href=\"https://stability.ai/\">StabilityAI</a> for the generous sponsorship, as well as my other sponsors out there\n\n- <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\">\ud83e\udd17 Huggingface</a> for their amazing transformers library.

(Although for scaling purposes, you will definitely want to precompute the textual embeddings + mask)\n\nThe number of textual captions must match the batch size of the images if you go this route.\n\n```python\n# mock images and text (get a lot of this)\n\ntexts = [\n    'a child screaming at finding a worm within a half-eaten apple',\n    'lizard running across the desert on two feet',\n    'waking up to a psychedelic landscape',\n    'seashells sparkling in the shallow waters'\n]\n\nimages = torch.randn(4, 3, 256, 256).cuda()\n\n# feed images into imagen, training each unet in the cascade\n\nfor i in (1, 2):\n    loss = imagen(images, texts = texts, unet_number = i)\n    loss.backward()\n```\n\nWith the `ImagenTrainer` wrapper class, the exponential moving averages for all of the U-nets in the cascading DDPM will be automatically taken care of when calling `update`\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom imagen_pytorch import Unet, Imagen, ImagenTrainer\n\n# unet for imagen\n\nunet1 = Unet(\n    dim = 32,\n    cond_dim = 512,\n    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),\n    num_resnet_blocks = 3,\n    layer_attns = (False, True, True, True),\n)\n\nunet2 = Unet(\n    dim = 32,\n    cond_dim = 512,\n    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),\n    num_resnet_blocks = (2, 4, 8, 8),\n    layer_attns = (False, False, False, True),\n    layer_cross_attns = (False, False, False, True)\n)\n\n# imagen, which contains the unets above (base unet and super resoluting ones)\n\nimagen = Imagen(\n    unets = (unet1, unet2),\n    text_encoder_name = 't5-large',\n    image_sizes = (64, 256),\n    timesteps = 1000,\n    cond_drop_prob = 0.1\n).cuda()\n\n# wrap imagen with the trainer class\n\ntrainer = ImagenTrainer(imagen)\n\n# mock images (get a lot of this) and text encodings from large T5\n\ntext_embeds = torch.randn(64, 256, 1024).cuda()\nimages = torch.randn(64, 3, 256, 256).cuda()\n\n# feed images into imagen, training each unet in the cascade\n\nloss = trainer(\n    images,\n    text_embeds = text_embeds,\n    unet_number = 1,            # training on unet number 1 in this example, but you will have to also save checkpoints and then reload and continue training on unet number 2\n    max_batch_size = 4          # auto divide the batch of 64 up into batch size of 4 and accumulate gradients, so it all fits in memory\n)\n\ntrainer.update(unet_number = 1)\n\n# do the above for many many many many steps\n# now you can sample an image based on the text embeddings from the cascading ddpm\n\nimages = trainer.sample(texts = [\n    'a puppy looking anxiously at a giant donut on the table',\n    'the milky way galaxy in the style of monet'\n], cond_scale = 3.)\n\nimages.shape # (2, 3, 256, 256)\n```\n\nYou can also train Imagen without text (unconditional image generation) as follows\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom imagen_pytorch import Unet, Imagen, SRUnet256, ImagenTrainer\n\n# unets for unconditional imagen\n\nunet1 = Unet(\n    dim = 32,\n    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4),\n    num_resnet_blocks = 3,\n    layer_attns = (False, True, True),\n    layer_cross_attns = False,\n    use_linear_attn = True\n)\n\nunet2 = SRUnet256(\n    dim = 32,\n    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4),\n    num_resnet_blocks = (2, 4, 8),\n    layer_attns = (False, False, True),\n    layer_cross_attns = False\n)\n\n# imagen, which contains the unets above (base unet and super resoluting ones)\n\nimagen = Imagen(\n    condition_on_text = False,   # this must be set to False for unconditional Imagen\n    unets = (unet1, unet2),\n    image_sizes = (64, 128),\n    timesteps = 1000\n)\n\ntrainer = ImagenTrainer(imagen).cuda()\n\n# now get a ton of images and feed it through the Imagen trainer\n\ntraining_images = torch.randn(4, 3, 256, 256).cuda()\n\n# train each unet separately\n# in this example, only training on unet number 1\n\nloss = trainer(training_images, unet_number = 1)\ntrainer.update(unet_number = 1)\n\n# do the above for many many many many steps\n# now you can sample images unconditionally from the cascading unet(s)\n\nimages = trainer.sample(batch_size = 16) # (16, 3, 128, 128)\n```\n\nOr train only super-resoluting unets\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom imagen_pytorch import Unet, NullUnet, Imagen\n\n# unet for imagen\n\nunet1 = NullUnet()  # add a placeholder \"null\" unet for the base unet\n\nunet2 = Unet(\n    dim = 32,\n    cond_dim = 512,\n    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),\n    num_resnet_blocks = (2, 4, 8, 8),\n    layer_attns = (False, False, False, True),\n    layer_cross_attns = (False, False, False, True)\n)\n\n# imagen, which contains the unets above (base unet and super resoluting ones)\n\nimagen = Imagen(\n    unets = (unet1, unet2),\n    image_sizes = (64, 256),\n    timesteps = 250,\n    cond_drop_prob = 0.1\n).cuda()\n\n# mock images (get a lot of this) and text encodings from large T5\n\ntext_embeds = torch.randn(4, 256, 768).cuda()\nimages = torch.randn(4, 3, 256, 256).cuda()\n\n# feed images into imagen, training each unet in the cascade\n\nloss = imagen(images, text_embeds = text_embeds, unet_number = 2)\nloss.backward()\n\n# do the above for many many many many steps\n# now you can sample an image based on the text embeddings as well as low resolution images\n\nlowres_images = torch.randn(3, 3, 64, 64).cuda()  # starting un-resoluted images\n\nimages = imagen.sample(\n    texts = [\n        'a whale breaching from afar',\n        'young girl blowing out candles on her birthday cake',\n        'fireworks with blue and green sparkles'\n    ],\n    start_at_unet_number = 2,              # start at unet number 2\n    start_image_or_video = lowres_images,  # pass in low resolution images to be resoluted\n    cond_scale = 3.)\n\nimages.shape # (3, 3, 256, 256)\n```\n\nAt any time you can save and load the trainer and all associated states with the `save` and `load` methods. It is recommended you use these methods instead of manually saving with a `state_dict` call, as there are some device memory management being done underneath the hood within the trainer.\n\nex.\n\n```python\ntrainer.save('./path/to/checkpoint.pt')\n\ntrainer.load('./path/to/checkpoint.pt')\n\ntrainer.steps # (2,) step number for each of the unets, in this case 2\n```\n\n## Dataloader\n\nYou can also rely on the `ImagenTrainer` to automatically train off `DataLoader` instances. You simply have to craft your `DataLoader` to return either `images` (for unconditional case), or of `('images', 'text_embeds')` for text-guided generation.\n\nex. unconditional training\n\n```python\nfrom imagen_pytorch import Unet, Imagen, ImagenTrainer\nfrom imagen_pytorch.data import Dataset\n\n# unets for unconditional imagen\n\nunet = Unet(\n    dim = 32,\n    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),\n    num_resnet_blocks = 1,\n    layer_attns = (False, False, False, True),\n    layer_cross_attns = False\n)\n\n# imagen, which contains the unet above\n\nimagen = Imagen(\n    condition_on_text = False,  # this must be set to False for unconditional Imagen\n    unets = unet,\n    image_sizes = 128,\n    timesteps = 1000\n)\n\ntrainer = ImagenTrainer(\n    imagen = imagen,\n    split_valid_from_train = True # whether to split the validation dataset from the training\n).cuda()\n\n# instantiate your dataloader, which returns the necessary inputs to the DDPM as tuple in the order of images, text embeddings, then text masks. in this case, only images is returned as it is unconditional training\n\ndataset = Dataset('/path/to/training/images', image_size = 128)\n\ntrainer.add_train_dataset(dataset, batch_size = 16)\n\n# working training loop\n\nfor i in range(200000):\n    loss = trainer.train_step(unet_number = 1, max_batch_size = 4)\n    print(f'loss: {loss}')\n\n    if not (i % 50):\n        valid_loss = trainer.valid_step(unet_number = 1, max_batch_size = 4)\n        print(f'valid loss: {valid_loss}')\n\n    if not (i % 100) and trainer.is_main: # is_main makes sure this can run in distributed\n        images = trainer.sample(batch_size = 1, return_pil_images = True) # returns List[Image]\n        images[0].save(f'./sample-{i // 100}.png')\n\n```\n\n## Multi GPU\n\nThanks to <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index\">\ud83e\udd17 Accelerate</a>, you can do multi GPU training easily with two steps.\n\nFirst you need to invoke `accelerate config` in the same directory as your training script (say it is named `train.py`)\n\n```bash\n$ accelerate config\n```\n\nNext, instead of calling `python train.py` as you would for single GPU, you would use the accelerate CLI as so\n\n```bash\n$ accelerate launch train.py\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\n## Command-line\n\nImagen can also be used via CLI directly.\n\n### Configuration\n\nex.\n\n```bash\n$ imagen config\n```\nor\n```bash\n$ imagen config --path ./configs/config.json\n```\n\nIn the config you are able to change settings for the trainer, dataset and the imagen config.\n\nThe Imagen config parameters can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/lucidrains/imagen-pytorch/blob/f8cc75f4d9020998c577b3770d3f260ce2ee2dcf/imagen_pytorch/configs.py#L68\">here</a>\n\nThe Elucidated Imagen config parameters can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/lucidrains/imagen-pytorch/blob/f8cc75f4d9020998c577b3770d3f260ce2ee2dcf/imagen_pytorch/configs.py#L108\">here</a>\n\nThe Imagen Trainer config parameters can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/lucidrains/imagen-pytorch/blob/f8cc75f4d9020998c577b3770d3f260ce2ee2dcf/imagen_pytorch/trainer.py#L226\">here</a>\n\nFor the dataset parameters all dataloader parameters can be used.\n\n### Training\n\nThis command allows you to train or resume training your model\n\nex.\n```bash\n$ imagen train\n```\nor\n```bash\n$ imagen train --unet 2 --epoches 10\n```\n\nYou can pass following arguments to the training command.\n\n- `--config` specify the config file to use for training [default: ./imagen_config.json]\n- `--unet` the index of the unet to train [default: 1]\n- `--epoches` how many epoches to train for [default: 50]\n\n### Sampling\n\nBe aware when sampling your checkpoint should have trained all unets to get a usable result.\n\nex.\n\n```bash\n$ imagen sample --model ./path/to/model/checkpoint.pt \"a squirrel raiding the birdfeeder\"\n# image is saved to ./a_squirrel_raiding_the_birdfeeder.png\n```\n\nYou can pass following arguments to the sample command.\n\n- `--model` specify the model file to use for sampling\n- `--cond_scale` conditioning scale (classifier free guidance) in decoder\n- `--load_ema` load EMA version of unets if available\n\nIn order to use a saved checkpoint with this feature, you either must instantiate your Imagen instance using the config classes, `ImagenConfig` and `ElucidatedImagenConfig` or create a checkpoint via the CLI directly\n\nFor proper training, you'll likely want to setup config-driven training anyways.\n\nex.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom imagen_pytorch import ImagenConfig, ElucidatedImagenConfig, ImagenTrainer\n\n# in this example, using elucidated imagen\n\nimagen = ElucidatedImagenConfig(\n    unets = [\n        dict(dim = 32, dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8)),\n        dict(dim = 32, dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8))\n    ],\n    image_sizes = (64, 128),\n    cond_drop_prob = 0.5,\n    num_sample_steps = 32\n).create()\n\ntrainer = ImagenTrainer(imagen)\n\n# do your training ...\n\n# then save it\n\ntrainer.save('./checkpoint.pt')\n\n# you should see a message informing you that ./checkpoint.pt is commandable from the terminal\n```\n\nIt really should be as simple as that\n\nYou can also pass this checkpoint file around, and anyone can continue finetune on their own data\n\n```python\nfrom imagen_pytorch import load_imagen_from_checkpoint, ImagenTrainer\n\nimagen = load_imagen_from_checkpoint('./checkpoint.pt')\n\ntrainer = ImagenTrainer(imagen)\n\n# continue training / fine-tuning\n```\n\n## Inpainting\n\nInpainting follows the formulation laid out by the recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09865\">Repaint paper</a>. Simply pass in `inpaint_images` and `inpaint_masks` to the `sample` function on either `Imagen` or `ElucidatedImagen`\n\n```python\n\ninpaint_images = torch.randn(4, 3, 512, 512).cuda()      # (batch, channels, height, width)\ninpaint_masks = torch.ones((4, 512, 512)).bool().cuda()  # (batch, height, width)\n\ninpainted_images = trainer.sample(texts = [\n    'a whale breaching from afar',\n    'young girl blowing out candles on her birthday cake',\n    'fireworks with blue and green sparkles',\n    'dust motes swirling in the morning sunshine on the windowsill'\n], inpaint_images = inpaint_images, inpaint_masks = inpaint_masks, cond_scale = 5.)\n\ninpainted_images # (4, 3, 512, 512)\n```\n\nFor video, similarly pass in your videos to `inpaint_videos` keyword on `.sample`. Inpainting mask can either be the same across all frames `(batch, height, width)` or different `(batch, frames, height, width)`\n\n```python\n\ninpaint_videos = torch.randn(4, 3, 8, 512, 512).cuda()   # (batch, channels, frames, height, width)\ninpaint_masks = torch.ones((4, 8, 512, 512)).bool().cuda()  # (batch, frames, height, width)\n\ninpainted_videos = trainer.sample(texts = [\n    'a whale breaching from afar',\n    'young girl blowing out candles on her birthday cake',\n    'fireworks with blue and green sparkles',\n    'dust motes swirling in the morning sunshine on the windowsill'\n], inpaint_videos = inpaint_videos, inpaint_masks = inpaint_masks, cond_scale = 5.)\n\ninpainted_videos # (4, 3, 8, 512, 512)\n```\n\n## Experimental\n\n<a href=\"https://research.nvidia.com/person/tero-karras\">Tero Karras</a> of StyleGAN fame has written a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364\">new paper</a> with results that have been corroborated by a number of independent researchers as well as on my own machine. I have decided to create a version of `Imagen`, the `ElucidatedImagen`, so that one can use the new elucidated DDPM for text-guided cascading generation.\n\nSimply import `ElucidatedImagen`, and then instantiate the instance as you did before. The hyperparameters are different than the usual ones for discrete and continuous time gaussian diffusion, and can be individualized for each unet in the cascade.\n\nEx.\n\n```python\nfrom imagen_pytorch import ElucidatedImagen\n\n# instantiate your unets ...\n\nimagen = ElucidatedImagen(\n    unets = (unet1, unet2),\n    image_sizes = (64, 128),\n    cond_drop_prob = 0.1,\n    num_sample_steps = (64, 32), # number of sample steps - 64 for base unet, 32 for upsampler (just an example, have no clue what the optimal values are)\n    sigma_min = 0.002,           # min noise level\n    sigma_max = (80, 160),       # max noise level, @crowsonkb recommends double the max noise level for upsampler\n    sigma_data = 0.5,            # standard deviation of data distribution\n    rho = 7,                     # controls the sampling schedule\n    P_mean = -1.2,               # mean of log-normal distribution from which noise is drawn for training\n    P_std = 1.2,                 # standard deviation of log-normal distribution from which noise is drawn for training\n    S_churn = 80,                # parameters for stochastic sampling - depends on dataset, Table 5 in apper\n    S_tmin = 0.05,\n    S_tmax = 50,\n    S_noise = 1.003,\n).cuda()\n\n# rest is the same as above\n\n```\n\n## Text to Video\n\nThis repository will also start accumulating new research around text guided video synthesis. For starters it will adopt the 3d unet architecture described by Jonathan Ho in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03458\">Video Diffusion Models</a>\n\nUpdate: verified <a href=\"https://github.com/lucidrains/imagen-pytorch/issues/305#issuecomment-1407015141\">working</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/HReynaud\">Hadrien Reynaud</a>!\n\nEx.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom imagen_pytorch import Unet3D, ElucidatedImagen, ImagenTrainer\n\nunet1 = Unet3D(dim = 64, dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8)).cuda()\n\nunet2 = Unet3D(dim = 64, dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8)).cuda()\n\n# elucidated imagen, which contains the unets above (base unet and super resoluting ones)\n\nimagen = ElucidatedImagen(\n    unets = (unet1, unet2),\n    image_sizes = (16, 32),\n    random_crop_sizes = (None, 16),\n    temporal_downsample_factor = (2, 1),        # in this example, the first unet would receive the video temporally downsampled by 2x\n    num_sample_steps = 10,\n    cond_drop_prob = 0.1,\n    sigma_min = 0.002,                          # min noise level\n    sigma_max = (80, 160),                      # max noise level, double the max noise level for upsampler\n    sigma_data = 0.5,                           # standard deviation of data distribution\n    rho = 7,                                    # controls the sampling schedule\n    P_mean = -1.2,                              # mean of log-normal distribution from which noise is drawn for training\n    P_std = 1.2,                                # standard deviation of log-normal distribution from which noise is drawn for training\n    S_churn = 80,                               # parameters for stochastic sampling - depends on dataset, Table 5 in apper\n    S_tmin = 0.05,\n    S_tmax = 50,\n    S_noise = 1.003,\n).cuda()\n\n# mock videos (get a lot of this) and text encodings from large T5\n\ntexts = [\n    'a whale breaching from afar',\n    'young girl blowing out candles on her birthday cake',\n    'fireworks with blue and green sparkles',\n    'dust motes swirling in the morning sunshine on the windowsill'\n]\n\nvideos = torch.randn(4, 3, 10, 32, 32).cuda() # (batch, channels, time / video frames, height, width)\n\n# feed images into imagen, training each unet in the cascade\n# for this example, only training unet 1\n\ntrainer = ImagenTrainer(imagen)\n\n# you can also ignore time when training on video initially, shown to improve results in video-ddpm paper. eventually will make the 3d unet trainable with either images or video. research shows it is essential (with current data regimes) to train first on text-to-image. probably won't be true in another decade. all big data becomes small data\n\ntrainer(videos, texts = texts, unet_number = 1, ignore_time = False)\ntrainer.update(unet_number = 1)\n\nvideos = trainer.sample(texts = texts, video_frames = 20) # extrapolating to 20 frames from training on 10 frames\n\nvideos.shape # (4, 3, 20, 32, 32)\n\n```\n\nYou can also train on text - image pairs first. The `Unet3D` will automatically convert it to single framed videos and learn without the temporal components (by automatically setting `ignore_time = True`), whether it be 1d convolutions or causal attention across time.\n\nThis is the current approach taken by all the big artificial intelligence labs (Brain, MetaAI, Bytedance)\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Why are my generated images not aligning well with the text?\n\nImagen uses an algorithm called <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=qw8AKxfYbI\">Classifier Free Guidance</a>. When sampling, you apply a scale to the conditioning (text in this case) of greater than `1.0`.\n\nResearcher <a href=\"https://github.com/Netruk44 \">Netruk44</a> have reported `5-10` to be optimal, but anything greater than `10` to break.\n\n```python\ntrainer.sample(texts = [\n    'a cloud in the shape of a roman gladiator'\n], cond_scale = 5.) # <-- cond_scale is the conditioning scale, needs to be greater than 1.0 to be better than average\n```\n\n- Are there any pretrained models yet?\n\nNot at the moment but one will likely be trained and open sourced within the year, if not sooner. If you would like to participate, you can join the community of artificial neural network trainers at Laion (discord link is in the Readme above) and start collaborating.\n\n- Will this technology take my job?\n\nMore the reason why you should start training your own model, starting today! The last thing we need is this technology being in the hands of an elite few. Hopefully this repository reduces the work to just finding the necessary compute, and augmenting with your own curated dataset.\n\n- What am I allowed to do with this repository?\n\nAnything! It is MIT licensed. In other words, you can freely copy / paste for your own research, remixed for whatever modality you can think of. Go train amazing models for profit, for science, or simply to satiate your own personal pleasure at witnessing something divine unravel in front of you.\n\n## Cool Applications!\n\n- <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12644\">Echocardiogram synthesis</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/HReynaud/EchoDiffusion\">[Code]</a>\n\n- <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.25.564065v1\">SOTA Hi-C contact matrix synthesis</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/CHNFTQ/Capricorn\">[Code]</a>\n\n- <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15941\">Floor plan generation</a>\n\n- <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01152\">Ultra High Resolution Histopathology Slides</a>\n\n- <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03043\">Synthetic Laparoscopic Images</a>\n\n- <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00762-x\">Designing MetaMaterials</a>\n\n## Related Works\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/archinetai/audio-diffusion-pytorch\">Audio diffusion</a> from <a href=\"https://github.com/flavioschneider\">Flavio Schneider</a>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/MinImagen\">Mini Imagen</a> from <a href=\"https://github.com/oconnoob\">Ryan O.</a> | <a href=\"https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/build-your-own-imagen-text-to-image-model/\">AssemblyAI writeup</a>\n\n## Todo\n\n- [x] use huggingface transformers for T5-small text embeddings\n- [x] add dynamic thresholding\n- [x] add dynamic thresholding DALLE2 and video-diffusion repository as well\n- [x] allow for one to set T5-large (and perhaps small factory method to take in any huggingface transformer)\n- [x] add the lowres noise level with the pseudocode in appendix, and figure out what is this sweep they do at inference time\n- [x] port over some training code from DALLE2\n- [x] need to be able to use a different noise schedule per unet (cosine was used for base, but linear for SR)\n- [x] just make one master-configurable unet\n- [x] complete resnet block (biggan inspired? but with groupnorm) -
