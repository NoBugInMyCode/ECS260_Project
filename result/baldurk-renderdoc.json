It is completely open-source under the MIT license.\n\nRenderDoc is intended for debugging your own programs only. Any discussion of capturing programs that you did not create will not be allowed in any official public RenderDoc setting, including the issue tracker, discord, or via email. For example this includes capturing commercial games that you did not create, or capturing Google Maps or Google Earth. Note: Capturing projects you created that use a third party engine like Unreal or Unity, or open source and free projects is completely fine and supported.\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or problems or you can [create an issue](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc/issues/new/choose) here on github, [email me directly](mailto:baldurk@baldurk.org) or come into [IRC](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=renderdoc) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/ahq6yRB) to discuss it.\n\nTo install on windows run the appropriate installer for your OS ([64-bit](https://renderdoc.org/stable/latest/RenderDoc_latest_64.msi) | [32-bit](https://renderdoc.org/stable/latest/RenderDoc_latest_32.msi)) or download the portable zip from the [builds page](https://renderdoc.org/builds). The 64-bit windows build fully supports capturing from 32-bit programs. On linux only 64-bit x86 is supported - there is a precompiled [binary tarball](https://renderdoc.org/stable/latest/renderdoc_latest.tar.gz) available, or your distribution may package it. If not you can [build from source](docs/CONTRIBUTING/Compiling.md).\n\n* **Downloads**: Stable and nightly builds: https://renderdoc.org/builds ( [Symbol server](https://renderdoc.org/symbols) )\n* **Documentation**: [HTML online](https://renderdoc.org/docs), [CHM in builds](https://renderdoc.org/docs/renderdoc.chm), [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/baldurkarlsson)\n* **Contact**: [baldurk@baldurk.org](mailto:baldurk@baldurk.org), [#renderdoc on OFTC IRC](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=renderdoc), [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ahq6yRB)\n* **Code of Conduct**: [Contributor Covenant](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n* **Information for contributors**: [All contribution information](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md), [Compilation instructions](docs/CONTRIBUTING/Compiling.md)\n* **Community extensions**: [Extensions repository](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc-contrib)\n\nScreenshots\n--------------\n\n| [ ![Texture view](https://renderdoc.org/fp/ts_screen1.jpg?2) ](https://renderdoc.org/fp/screen1.jpg) | [ ![Pixel history & shader debug](https://renderdoc.org/fp/ts_screen2.jpg?2) ](https://renderdoc.org/fp/screen2.png) |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ ![Mesh viewer](https://renderdoc.org/fp/ts_screen3.jpg?2) ](https://renderdoc.org/fp/screen3.png) | [ ![Pipeline viewer & constants](https://renderdoc.org/fp/ts_screen4.jpg?2) ](https://renderdoc.org/fp/screen4.png) |\n\nAPI Support\n--------------\n\n|                          | Windows                  | Linux                    | Android                   |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------  |\n| Vulkan                   | :heavy_check_mark:       | :heavy_check_mark:       | :heavy_check_mark:        |\n| OpenGL ES 2.0 - 3.2      | :heavy_check_mark:       | :heavy_check_mark:       | :heavy_check_mark:        |\n| OpenGL 3.2 - 4.6 Core    | :heavy_check_mark:       | :heavy_check_mark:       |  N/A                      |\n| D3D11 & D3D12            | :heavy_check_mark:       |  N/A                     |  N/A                      |\n| OpenGL 1.0 - 2.0 Compat  | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_multiplication_x: |  N/A                      |\n| D3D9 & 10                | :heavy_multiplication_x: |  N/A                     |  N/A                      |\n| Metal                    |  N/A                     |  N/A                     |  N/A                      |\n\n* Nintendo Switch&trade; support is distributed separately for authorized developers as part of the NintendoSDK. For more information, consult the Nintendo Developer Portal.\n\nDownloads\n--------------\n\nThere are [binary releases](https://renderdoc.org/builds) available, built from the release targets. If you just want to use the program and you ended up here, this is what you want :).\n\nIt's recommended that if you're new you start with the stable builds. Nightly builds are available every day from the [v1.x branch here](https://renderdoc.org/builds#nightly) if you need it, but correspondingly may be less stable.\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n\nThe text documentation is available [online for the latest stable version](https://renderdoc.org/docs/), as well as in [renderdoc.chm](https://renderdoc.org/docs/renderdoc.chm) in any build. It's built from [restructured text with sphinx](docs).\n\nAs mentioned above there are some [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/baldurkarlsson) showing the use of some basic features and an introduction/overview.\n\nThere is also a great presentation by [@Icetigris](https://twitter.com/Icetigris) which goes into some details of how RenderDoc can be used in real world situations: [slides are up here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LQUMIld4SGoQVthnhT1scoA3k4Sg0as14G4NeSiSgFU/edit#slide=id.p).\n\nLicense\n--------------\n\nRenderDoc is released under the MIT license, see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for full text as well as 3rd party library acknowledgements.\n\nCompiling\n---------\n\nBuilding RenderDoc is fairly straight forward on most platforms. See [Compiling.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING/Compiling.md) for more details.\n\nContributing & Development\n--------------\n\nI've added some notes on how to contribute, as well as where to get started looking through the code in [Developing-Change.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING/Developing-Change.md). All contribution information is available under [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n",
