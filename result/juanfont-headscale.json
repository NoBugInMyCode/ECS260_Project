It assigns the IP addresses of the clients,\ncreates the boundaries between each user, enables sharing machines between users,\nand exposes the advertised routes of your nodes.\n\nA [Tailscale network (tailnet)](https://tailscale.com/kb/1136/tailnet/) is private\nnetwork which Tailscale assigns to a user in terms of private users or an\norganisation.\n\n## Design goal\n\nHeadscale aims to implement a self-hosted, open source alternative to the Tailscale\ncontrol server.\nHeadscale's goal is to provide self-hosters and hobbyists with an open-source\nserver they can use for their projects and labs.\nIt implements a narrow scope, a single Tailnet, suitable for a personal use, or a small\nopen-source organisation.\n\n## Supporting Headscale\n\nIf you like `headscale` and find it useful, there is a sponsorship and donation\nbuttons available in the repo.\n\n## Features\n\nPlease see [\"Features\" in the documentation](https://headscale.net/stable/about/features/).\n\n## Client OS support\n\nPlease see [\"Client and operating system support\" in the documentation](https://headscale.net/stable/about/clients/).\n\n## Running headscale\n\n**Please note that we do not support nor encourage the use of reverse proxies\nand container to run Headscale.**\n\nPlease have a look at the [`documentation`](https://headscale.net/stable/).\n\n## Talks\n\n- Fosdem 2023 (video): [Headscale: How we are using integration testing to reimplement Tailscale](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/goheadscale/)\n  - presented by Juan Font Alonso and Kristoffer Dalby\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis project is not associated with Tailscale Inc.\n\nHowever, one of the active maintainers for Headscale [is employed by Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/blog/opensource) and he is allowed to spend work hours contributing to the project. Contributions from this maintainer are reviewed by other maintainers.\n\nThe maintainers work together on setting the direction for the project. The underlying principle is to serve the community of self-hosters, enthusiasts and hobbyists - while having a sustainable project.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo contribute to headscale you would need the latest version of [Go](https://golang.org)\nand [Buf](https://buf.build) (Protobuf generator).\n\nWe recommend using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to setup a development environment. This can\nbe done with `nix develop`, which will install the tools and give you a shell.\nThis guarantees that you will have the same dev env as `headscale` maintainers.\n\n### Code style\n\nTo ensure we have some consistency with a growing number of contributions,\nthis project has adopted linting and style/formatting rules:\n\nThe **Go** code is linted with [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run) and\nformatted with [`golines`](https://github.com/segmentio/golines) (width 88) and\n[`gofumpt`](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt).\nPlease configure your editor to run the tools while developing and make sure to\nrun `make lint` and `make fmt` before committing any code.\n\nThe **Proto** code is linted with [`buf`](https://docs.buf.build/lint/overview) and\nformatted with [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).\n\nThe **rest** (Markdown, YAML, etc) is formatted with [`prettier`](https://prettier.io).\n\nCheck out the `.golangci.yaml` and `Makefile` to see the specific configuration.\n\n### Install development tools\n\n- Go\n- Buf\n- Protobuf tools\n\nInstall and activate:\n\n```shell\nnix develop\n```\n\n### Testing and building\n\nSome parts of the project require the generation of Go code from Protobuf\n(if changes are made in `proto/`) and it must be (re-)generated with:\n\n```shell\nmake generate\n```\n\n**Note**: Please check in changes from `gen/` in a separate commit to make it easier to review.\n\nTo run the tests:\n\n```shell\nmake test\n```\n\nTo build the program:\n\n```shell\nnix build\n```\n\nor\n\n```shell\nmake build\n```\n\n## Contributors\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=juanfont/headscale\" />\n</a>\n\nMade with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).\n",
