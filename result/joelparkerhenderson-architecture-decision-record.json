hence they have to be communicated to, and accepted by, the stakeholders of the system that fund, develop, and operate it.\n\n  * Architecturally evident coding styles and code reviews that focus on architectural concerns and decisions are two related practices.\n\n  * ADs also have to be (re-)considered when modernizing a software system in software evolution.\n\nDecision sharing (optional):\n\n  * Many ADs recur across projects.\n\n  * Hence, experiences with past decisions, both good and bad, can be valuable reusable assets when employing an explicit knowledge management strategy.\n\nDecision documentation:\n\n  * Many templates and tools for decision capturing exist.\n\n  * See agile communities, e.g. M. Nygard's ADRs.\n\n  * See traditional software engineering and architecture design processes, e.g. table layouts suggested by IBM UMF and by Tyree and Akerman from CapitalOne.\n\nFor more:\n\n  * The steps above are adopted from the Wikipedia entry on [Architectural Decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision)\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"include\" data-path=\"locales/en/how-to-start-using-adrs-with-tools\">\n\n## How to start using ADRs with tools\n\nYou can start using ADRs with tools any way you want.\n\nFor example:\n\n  * If you like using Google Drive and online editing, then you can create a Google Doc, or Google Sheet.\n\n  * If you like use source code version control, such as git, then you can create a file for each ADR.\n\n  * If you like using project planning tools, such as Atlassian Jira, then you can use the tool's planning tracker.\n\n  * If you like using wikis, such as MediaWiki, then you can create an ADR wiki.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"include\" data-path=\"locales/en/how-to-start-using-ADRs-with-git\">\n\n## How to start using ADRs with git\n\nIf you like using git version control, then here is how we like to start using ADRs with git for a typical software project with source code.\n\nCreate a directory for ADR files:\n\n```sh\n$ mkdir adr\n```\n\nFor each ADR, create a text file, such as `database.txt`:\n\n```sh\n$ vi database.txt\n```\n\nWrite anything you want in the ADR. See the templates in this repository for ideas.\n\nCommit the ADR to your git repo.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"include\" data-path=\"locales/en/file-name-conventions-for-adrs\">\n\n## File name conventions for ADRs\n\nIf you choose to create your ADRs using typical text files, then you may want to come up with your own ADR file name convention.\n\nWe prefer to use a file name convention that has a specific format.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * choose-database.md\n\n  * format-timestamps.md\n\n  * manage-passwords.md\n\n  * handle-exceptions.md\n\nOur file name convention:\n\n  * The name has a present tense imperative verb phrase. This helps readability and matches our commit message format.\n\n  * The name uses lowercase and dashes (same as this repo). This is a balance of readability and system usability.\n\n  * The extension is markdown. This can be useful for easy formatting.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"import\" data-path=\"locales/en/suggestions-for-writing-good-adrs\">\n\n## Suggestions for writing good ADRs\n\nCharacteristics of a good ADR:\n\n  * Rationale: Explain the reasons for doing the particular AD. This can include the context (see below), pros and cons of various potential choices, feature comparisons, cost/benefit discussions, and more.\n\n  * Specific: Each ADR should be about one AD, not multiple ADs.\n\n  * Timestamps: Identify when each item in the ADR is written. This is especially important for aspects that may change over time, such as costs, schedules, scaling, and the like.\n\n  * Immutable: Don't alter existing information in an ADR. Instead, amend the ADR by adding new information, or supersede the ADR by creating a new ADR.\n\nCharacteristics of a good \"Context\" section in an ADR:\n\n  * Explain your organization's situation and business priorities.\n\n  * Include rationale and considerations based on social and skills makeups of your teams.\n\n  * Include pros and cons that are relevant, and describe them in terms that align with your needs and goals.\n\nCharacteristics of good \"Consequences\" section in an ADR:\n\n  * Explain what follows from making the decision. This can include the effects, outcomes, outputs, follow ups, and more.\n\n  * Include information about any subsequent ADRs. It's relatively common for one ADR to trigger the need for more ADRs, such as when one ADR makes a big overarching choice, which in turn creates needs for more smaller decisions.\n\n  * Include any after-action review processes. It's typical for teams to review each ADR one month later, to compare the ADR information with what's happened in actual practice, in order to learn and grow.\n\nA new ADR may take the place of a previous ADR:\n\n  * When an AD is made that replaces or invalidates a previous ADR, then a new ADR should be created\n\n</div>\n\n## ADR example templates\n\nADR example templates that we have collected on the net:\n\n  * [ADR template by Michael Nygard](locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/) (simple and popular)\n\n  * [ADR template by Jeff Tyree and Art Akerman](locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-jeff-tyree-and-art-akerman/) (more sophisticated)\n\n  * [ADR template for Alexandrian pattern](locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-for-alexandrian-pattern/) (simple with context specifics)\n\n  * [ADR template for business case](locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-for-business-case/) (more MBA-oriented, with costs, SWOT, and more opinions)\n\n  * [ADR template of the Markdown Any Decision Records (MADR) project](locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-of-the-madr-project/) (both simple and elaborate version; the latter emphasizes options and their pros and cons)\n\n  * [ADR template using Planguage](locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-using-planguage/) (more quality assurance oriented)\n\n<div class=\"import\" data-path=\"locales/en/teamwork-advice-for-adrs\">\n\n## Teamwork advice for ADRs\n\nIf you're considering using decision records with your team, then here's some advice that we've learned by working with many teams.\n\nYou have an opportunity to lead your teammates, by talking together about the \"why\", rather than mandating the \"what\". For example, decision records are a way for teams to think smarter and communicate better; decision records are not valuable if they're just an after-the-fact forced paperwork requirement.\n\nSome teams much prefer the name \"decisions\" over the abbreviation \"ADRs\". When some teams use the directory name \"decisions\", then it's as if a light bulb turns on, and the team starts putting more information into the directory, such as vendor decisions, planning decisions, scheduling decisions, etc. All of these kinds of information can use the same template. We hypothesize that people learn faster with words (\"decisions\") over abbreviations (\"ADRs\"), and people are more motivated to write work-in-progress docs when the word \"record\" is removed, and also some developers and some managers dislike the word \"architecture\".\n\nIn theory, immutability is ideal. In practice, mutability has worked better for our teams. We insert the new info the existing ADR, with a date stamp, and a note that the info arrived after the decision. This kind of approach leads to a \"living document\" that we all can update. Typical updates are when we get information thanks to new teammates, or new offerings, or real-world results of our usages, or after-the-fact third-party changes such as vendor capabilities, pricing plans, license agreements, etc.\n\n</div>\n\n## For more information\n\nIntroduction:\n\n  * [Architectural decision (wikipedia.org)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision)\n\n  * [Architecturally significant requirements (wikipedia.org)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecturally_significant_requirements)\n\nTemplates:\n\n  * [Documenting architecture decisions -
