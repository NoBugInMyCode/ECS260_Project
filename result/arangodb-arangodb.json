Native graphs, an integrated search engine, and JSON support, via a\nsingle query language. ArangoDB runs on-prem, in the cloud \u2013 anywhere.\n\nArangoDB Cloud Service\n----------------------\n\nThe [ArangoGraph Insights Platform](https://cloud.arangodb.com/home) is the\nsimplest way to run ArangoDB. You can create deployments on all major cloud\nproviders in many regions with ease.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n- [ArangoDB University](https://university.arangodb.com/)\n- [Free Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/getting-started-with-arangodb)\n- [Training Center](https://www.arangodb.com/learn/)\n- [Documentation](https://docs.arangodb.com/)\n\nFor the impatient:\n\n- Test ArangoDB in the cloud with [ArangoGraph](https://cloud.arangodb.com/home) for free.\n\n- Alternatively, [download](https://www.arangodb.com/download) and install ArangoDB.\n  Start the server `arangod` if the installer did not do it for you.\n\n  Or start ArangoDB in a Docker container:\n\n      docker run -e ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=test123 -p 8529:8529 -d arangodb\n\n  Then point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8529/`.\n\nKey Features of ArangoDB\n------------------------\n\n**Native Graph** - Store both data and relationships, for faster queries even\nwith multiple levels of joins and deeper insights that simply aren't possible\nwith traditional relational and document database systems.\n\n**Document Store** - Every node in your graph is a JSON document:\nflexible, extensible, and easily imported from your existing document database.\n\n**ArangoSearch** - Natively integrated cross-platform indexing, text-search and\nranking engine for information retrieval, optimized for speed and memory.\n\nArangoDB is available in a free and open-source **Community Edition**, as well\nas a commercial **Enterprise Edition** with additional features.\n\n### Community Edition features\n\n- **Horizontal scalability**: Seamlessly shard your data across multiple machines.\n- **High availability** and **resilience**: Replicate data to multiple cluster\n  nodes, with automatic failover.\n- **Flexible data modeling**: Model your data as combination of key-value pairs,\n  documents, and graphs as you see fit for your application.\n- Work **schema-free** or use **schema validation** for data consistency.\n  Store any type of data - date/time, geo-spatial, text, nested.\n- **Powerful query language** (_AQL_) to retrieve and modify data - from simple\n  CRUD operations, over complex filters and aggregations, all the way to joins,\n  graphs, and ranked full-text search.\n- **Transactions**: Run queries on multiple documents or collections with\n  optional transactional consistency and isolation.\n- **Data-centric microservices**: Unify your data storage logic, reduce network\n  overhead, and secure sensitive data with the _ArangoDB Foxx_ JavaScript framework.\n- **Fast access to your data**: Fine-tune your queries with a variety of index\n  types for optimal performance. ArangoDB is written in C++ and can handle even\n  very large datasets efficiently.\n- Easy to use **web interface** and **command-line tools** for interaction\n  with the server.\n\n### Enterprise Edition features\n\nFocus on solving enterprise-scale problems for mission critical workloads using\nsecure graph data. The Enterprise Edition has all the features of the\nCommunity Edition and offers additional features for performance, compliance,\nand security, as well as further query capabilities.\n\n- Smartly shard and replicate graphs and datasets with features like\n  **EnterpriseGraphs**, **SmartGraphs**, and **SmartJoins** for lightning fast\n  query execution.\n- Combine the performance of a single server with the resilience of a cluster\n  setup using **OneShard** deployments.\n- Increase fault tolerance with **Datacenter-to-Datacenter Replication** and\n  and create incremental **Hot Backups** without downtime.\n- Enable highly secure work with **Encryption 360**, enhanced **Data Masking**, \n  and detailed **Auditing**.\n- Perform **parallel graph traversals**.\n- Use ArangoSearch **search highlighting** and **nested search** for advanced\n  information retrieval.\n\nLatest Release\n--------------\n\nPackages for all supported platforms can be downloaded from\n<https://www.arangodb.com/download/>.\n\nFor what's new in ArangoDB, see the Release Notes in the\n[Documentation](https://docs.arangodb.com/).\n\nStay in Contact\n---------------\n\n- Please use GitHub for feature requests and bug reports:\n  [https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues)\n\n- Ask questions about AQL, usage scenarios, etc. on StackOverflow:\n  [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/arangodb](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/arangodb)\n\n- Chat with the community and the developers on Slack:\n  [https://arangodb-community.slack.com/](https://arangodb-community.slack.com/)\n\n- Learn more about ArangoDB with our YouTube channel: \n  [https://www.youtube.com/@ArangoDB](https://www.youtube.com/@ArangoDB)\n\n- Follow us on Twitter to stay up to date:\n  [https://twitter.com/arangodb](https://twitter.com/arangodb)\n\n- Find out more about our community: [https://www.arangodb.com/community](https://www.arangodb.com/community/)\n",
