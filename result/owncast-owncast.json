[Read more about compatibility with existing software](https://owncast.online/docs/broadcasting/).\n\n## Building from Source\n\nOwncast consists of two projects.\n\n1. The Owncast backend is written in Go.\n1. The frontend is written in React.\n\n[Read more about running from source](https://owncast.online/development/).\n\n### Important note about source code and the develop branch\n\nThe `develop` branch is always the most up-to-date state of development and this may not be what you always want. If you want to run the latest released stable version, check out the tag related to that release. For example, if you'd only like the source prior to the v0.1.0 development cycle you can check out the `v0.0.13` tag.\n\n> Note: Currently Owncast does not natively support Windows servers. However, Windows Users can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) to install Owncast. For details visit [this document](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/blob/develop/contrib/owncast_for_windows.md).\n\n### Backend\n\nThe Owncast backend is a service written in Go.\n\n1. Ensure you have prerequisites installed.\n   - C compiler, such as [GCC compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/download.html) or a [Musl-compatible compiler](https://musl.libc.org/)\n   - [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)\n1. Install the [Go toolchain](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.22 or above).\n1. Clone the repo. `git clone https://github.com/owncast/owncast`\n1. `go run main.go` will run from the source.\n1. Visit `http://yourserver:8080` to access the web interface or `http://yourserver:8080/admin` to access the admin.\n1. Point your [broadcasting software](https://owncast.online/docs/broadcasting/) at your new server and start streaming.\n\n### Frontend\n\nThe frontend is the web interface that includes the player, chat, embed components, and other UI.\n\n1. This project lives in the `web` directory.\n1. Run `npm install` to install the Javascript dependencies.\n1. Run `npm run dev`\n\n## Contributing\n\nOwncast is a growing open source project that is giving freedom, flexibility and fun to live streamers.\nAnd while we have a small team of kind, talented and thoughtful volunteers, we have gaps in our skillset that we\u2019d love to fill so we can get even better at building tools that make a difference for people.\n\nWe abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://owncast.online/contribute/) and feel strongly about open, appreciative, and empathetic people joining us.\nWe\u2019ve been very lucky to have this so far, so maybe you can help us with your skills and passion, too!\n\nIf you're new to the project, maybe you'd be interested in looking at [![Good First Issue](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/owncast/owncast/good%20first%20issue.svg)](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\n\nThere is a larger, more detailed, and more up-to-date [guide for helping contribute to Owncast on our website](https://owncast.online/help/).\n\n### Donors\nThe Owncast project is possible thanks to the people who make a donation to support us and our work.\nThank you to all our donors who help keep Owncast running by donating on OpenCollective. You can support this project by [becoming a backer/sponsor](https://opencollective.com/owncast#suppor).\n\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://opencollective.com/owncast#support\">\n\t\t<img alt=\"GitHub issues by-label\" src=\"https://opencollective.com/owncast/tiers/backers.svg?avatarHeight=36&width=600\" alt=\"Backer button\">\n\t</a>\n</div>\n\t\n<!-- LICENSE -->\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the MIT License.
