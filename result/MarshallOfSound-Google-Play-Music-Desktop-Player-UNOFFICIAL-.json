Now also has YouTube Music player fully integrated.\n\nDeveloped by [Samuel Attard][1].\n\nNo affiliation with Google. Google Play is a trademark of Google Inc.\n\n[1]: https://www.samuelattard.com\n\nDownload\n---------\nHead over to our website http://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com to download the latest release for your platform.\n\nOS Support\n------------\n\n* Windows 7 or later\n* Mac OS X 10.9.0 or later\n* Ubuntu 14.04 or later\n* Mint\n* Fedora\n* Debian\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Supports media keys (play, pause, stop, next, previous)\n* [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com) fully integrated!\n* [last.fm](https://www.last.fm) & [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/) Scrobbling and Now Playing support!\n* Discord [Rich Presences](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) Now Playing information\n* Hands free [Voice Controls](docs/VoiceControls.md)!\n* Desktop notifications on track change\n* A simplistic mini player\n* Dark Theme\n* Customizable accent color + CSS support\n* Task bar media controls (media controls embedded into the taskbar) *Windows only*\n* Smooth scrolling and overlay scrollbars for a nicer User Experience\n* HTML5 Audio Support - No more Adobe Flash Player :+1:\n* Minimize to task bar for background music playing\n* Customizable hotkeys, no worries if you don't have media keys.  Choose your own shortcuts\n* Choose your audio output device from within the player\n* Song Lyrics for those Karaoke nights\n* And a whole lot more coming soon!\n\nIntegrating with GPMDP from External Applications\n-------------------------------------------------\nThere are two methods you can use to integrate with GPMDP from an external application.  \n1. [JSON Interface](docs/PlaybackAPI.md)  \n2. [Web Socket Interface](docs/PlaybackAPI_WebSocket.md)  \n\nBoth are documented in the [Docs](docs) folder.  For one time read access you should\nprobably use the `JSON` interface.  For an application that requires continuous\nupdates as to the state of GPMDP or needs to control GPMDP you should use the\n`Web Socket` interface.\n\nIssues\n-------\nIf you have any bugs / issues please check the\n[FAQ](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/wiki/FAQ)\nfirst before raising an issue\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\n[Logo](src/assets/icons/svg/vector_logo.svg) designed by @JayToe\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nTo get started just pull the repo and run the following\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run build\nnpm start\n```\n\nTo build the installers / release packages you need to run, you can only build a platforms installer from that platform.\n```bash\n# Windows\nnpm run make:win\n\n# Mac OS X\nnpm run make:darwin\n\n# Ubuntu (Requires the 'dpkg' package)\nnpm run make:deb\n\n# Fedora (Requires the 'rpm' package)\nnpm run make:rpm\n```\n\nAll releases will be signing with my Code Signing Certificates (Authenticode on Windows and Codesign on OS X)\n\nPlease see the [development FAQ](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/wiki/Development-FAQ) for additional requirements for building.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIf you find something wrong (theming issues, app crashes) please report them as an issue.  \nIf you think you can add something cool or fix a problem, fork the repo and make a pull request :D\n\n**NOTE:** Some of the functionality in this app has been extracted into smaller submodules. In particular\n* Google Play Music Interaction - https://github.com/gmusic-utils/gmusic.js\n* Theming - https://github.com/gmusic-utils/gmusic-theme.js\n* Mini Player - https://github.com/GPMDP/gmusic-mini-player.js\n* Electron Chromecast - https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-chromecast\n\nDev Requirements\n----------------\n* Node.js (Recommend `6.3.x`)\n* NPM (3.x.x)\n\nContinuous Integration\n------------------------\n\nWe run tests and generate signed installers on three CI platforms\n* Windows --> [AppVeyor][2]\n* Linux & OS X --> [Circle CI][3]\n\nYou can download the latest signed installers for Windows from the artifacts section of AppVeyor  \nYou can download the latest linux (debian and fedora) and OS X (darwin) builds from the artifacts section on Circle CI\n\n[2]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MarshallOfSound/google-play-music-desktop-player-unofficial\n[3]: https://circleci.com/gh/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Samuel Attard\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
