The document\n[HACKING.md](HACKING.md) includes detailed information on building and\ndeveloping Scylla, but to get Scylla building quickly on (almost) any build\nmachine, Scylla offers a [frozen toolchain](tools/toolchain/README.md),\nThis is a pre-configured Docker image which includes recent versions of all\nthe required compilers, libraries and build tools. Using the frozen toolchain\nallows you to avoid changing anything in your build machine to meet Scylla's\nrequirements - you just need to meet the frozen toolchain's prerequisites\n(mostly, Docker or Podman being available).\n\n## Building Scylla\n\nBuilding Scylla with the frozen toolchain `dbuild` is as easy as:\n\n```bash\n$ git submodule update --init --force --recursive\n$ ./tools/toolchain/dbuild ./configure.py\n$ ./tools/toolchain/dbuild ninja build/release/scylla\n```\n\nFor further information, please see:\n\n* [Developer documentation] for more information on building Scylla.\n* [Build documentation] on how to build Scylla binaries, tests, and packages.\n* [Docker image build documentation] for information on how to build Docker images.\n\n[developer documentation]: HACKING.md\n[build documentation]: docs/dev/building.md\n[docker image build documentation]: dist/docker/debian/README.md\n\n## Running Scylla\n\nTo start Scylla server, run:\n\n```bash\n$ ./tools/toolchain/dbuild ./build/release/scylla --workdir tmp --smp 1 --developer-mode 1\n```\n\nThis will start a Scylla node with one CPU core allocated to it and data files stored in the `tmp` directory.\nThe `--developer-mode` is needed to disable the various checks Scylla performs at startup to ensure the machine is configured for maximum performance (not relevant on development workstations).\nPlease note that you need to run Scylla with `dbuild` if you built it with the frozen toolchain.\n\nFor more run options, run:\n\n```bash\n$ ./tools/toolchain/dbuild ./build/release/scylla --help\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n[![Build with the latest Seastar](https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/actions/workflows/seastar.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/actions/workflows/seastar.yaml) [![Check Reproducible Build](https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/actions/workflows/reproducible-build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/actions/workflows/reproducible-build.yaml) [![clang-nightly](https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/actions/workflows/clang-nightly.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/actions/workflows/clang-nightly.yaml)\n\nSee [test.py manual](docs/dev/testing.md).\n\n## Scylla APIs and compatibility\nBy default, Scylla is compatible with Apache Cassandra and its API - CQL.\nThere is also support for the API of Amazon DynamoDB\u2122,\nwhich needs to be enabled and configured in order to be used. For more\ninformation on how to enable the DynamoDB\u2122 API in Scylla,\nand the current compatibility of this feature as well as Scylla-specific extensions, see\n[Alternator](docs/alternator/alternator.md) and\n[Getting started with Alternator](docs/alternator/getting-started.md).\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation can be found [here](docs/dev/README.md).\nSeastar documentation can be found [here](http://docs.seastar.io/master/index.html).\nUser documentation can be found [here](https://docs.scylladb.com/).\n\n## Training\n\nTraining material and online courses can be found at [Scylla University](https://university.scylladb.com/).\nThe courses are free, self-paced and include hands-on examples. They cover a variety of topics including Scylla data modeling,\nadministration, architecture, basic NoSQL concepts, using drivers for application development, Scylla setup, failover, compactions,\nmulti-datacenters and how Scylla integrates with third-party applications.\n\n## Contributing to Scylla\n\nIf you want to report a bug or submit a pull request or a patch, please read the [contribution guidelines].\n\nIf you are a developer working on Scylla, please read the [developer guidelines].\n\n[contribution guidelines]: CONTRIBUTING.md\n[developer guidelines]: HACKING.md\n\n## Contact\n\n* The [community forum] and [Slack channel] are for users to discuss configuration, management, and operations of the ScyllaDB open source.\n* The [developers mailing list] is for developers and people interested in following the development of ScyllaDB to discuss technical topics.\n\n[Community forum]: https://forum.scylladb.com/\n\n[Slack channel]: http://slack.scylladb.com/\n\n[Developers mailing list]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scylladb-dev\n",
