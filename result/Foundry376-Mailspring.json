It's faster, leaner, and shipping today!** It replaces the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine based on [Mailcore2](https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2). It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail and idles with almost zero \"CPU Wakes\", which translates to great battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other great new features.\n\nMailspring's UI is open source (GPLv3) and written in TypeScript with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - it's built on a plugin architecture and was designed to be easy to extend. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!\n\nMailspring's sync engine is spawned by the Electron application and runs locally on your computer. [It is open source (GPLv3) and written in C++ and C.](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Sync) For convenience, however, when you set up your development environment, Mailspring uses the latest version of the sync engine we've shipped for your platform so you don't need to pull sources or install its compile-time dependencies.\n\n![Mailspring Screenshot](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/raw/master/screenshots/hero_graphic_mac%402x.png)\n\n## Features\n\nMailspring comes packed with powerful features like Unified Inbox, Snooze, Send\nLater, Mail Rules, Templates and more. Mailspring Pro, which you can unlock\nwith a monthly subscription, adds even more features for people who send a ton\nof email: link tracking, read receipts, mailbox analytics, contact and company\nprofiles. **All of these features run in the client - Mailspring does not send\nyour email credentials to the cloud.** For a full list of features, check out\n[getmailspring.com](https://getmailspring.com/).\n\n## Download Mailspring\n\nYou can download compiled versions of Mailspring for Windows, Mac OS X, and\nLinux (deb, rpm and snap) from\n[https://getmailspring.com/download](https://getmailspring.com/download).\n\n## Getting Help\n\nYou can find community-based help and discussion with other Mailspring users on our\n[Discourse community](https://community.getmailspring.com/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nMailspring is entirely open-source. Pull requests and contributions are\nwelcome! There are three ways to contribute: building a plugin, building a\ntheme, and submitting pull requests to the project itself. When you're getting\nstarted, you may want to join our\n[Discourse](https://community.getmailspring.com/) so you can ask questions and\nlearn from other people doing development.\n\n[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n### Running Mailspring from Source\n\nTo install all dependencies and run Mailspring from its source code,\nrun the following commands from the root directory of the Mailspring repository:\n\n```\nexport npm_config_arch=x64 # If you are on an M1 / Apple Silicon Mac\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nYou can attach command line parameters by separating them using a double hyphen:\n\n```\nnpm start -- --help\n```\n\n### Building Mailspring\n\nTo build Mailspring, you need to run the following command from the root directory\nof the Mailspring repository:\n\n```\nnpm run-script build\n```\n\n### Building A Plugin\n\nPlugins lie at the heart of Mailspring and give it its powerful features.\nBuilding your own plugins allows you to integrate the app with other tools,\nexperiment with new workflows, and more. Follow the [Getting Started\nguide](https://Foundry376.github.io/Mailspring/) to write your first plugin in\nfive minutes.\n\n- To create your own theme, check out the\n  [Mailspring-Theme-Starter](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter).\n\n- To create your own plugin, check out the\n  [Mailspring-Plugin-Starter](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Plugin-Starter).\n\nA plugin \"store\" like the Chrome Web Store is coming soon, and will make it\neasy for other users to discover plugins you create. (Right now, users need to\n\"sideload\" the plugins into the app by downloading them and copying them into\nplace.)\n\nYou can share and browse Mailspring Plugins, and discuss plugin development\nwith other developers, on our\n[Discourse](https://community.getmailspring.com/).\n\n### Building a Theme\n\nThe Mailspring user interface is styled using CSS, which means it's easy to\nmodify and extend. Mailspring comes stock with a few beautiful themes, and\nthere are many more which have been built by community developers. To start\ncreating a theme, [clone the theme starter](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter)!\n\nIf you are updating an existing Nylas theme for Mailspring here is a\n[step by step tutorial](https://community.getmailspring.com/t/updating-an-n1-nylas-mail-theme-for-mailspring/195).\nNotice: as part of the update process you will probably need to [import mailspring base variables](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/issues/326#issuecomment-343757775).\n\nYou can share and browse Mailspring Themes, and discuss theme development with other developers, on our [Discourse](https://community.getmailspring.com/).\n\n### Localizing / Translating\n\nMailspring (1.5.0 and above) supports localization. If you're a fluent speaker of\nanother language, we'd love your help improving translations. Check out the\n[LOCALIZATION](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/blob/master/LOCALIZATION.md)\nguide for more information. You can discuss localization and translation with\nother developers on our [Discourse](https://community.getmailspring.com/).\n\n### Contributing to Mailspring Core\n\nPull requests are always welcome - check out\n[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor more information about setting up the development environment, running\ntests locally, and submitting pull requests.\n",
