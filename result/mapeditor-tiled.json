It can be used to create maps of any size, with no\nrestrictions on tile size, or the number of layers or tiles that can be used.\nMaps, layers, tiles, and objects can all be assigned arbitrary properties.\nTiled's map format (TMX) is easy to understand and allows multiple tilesets to\nbe used in any map. Tilesets can be modified at any time.\n\n[![Build Packages](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled/actions/workflows/packages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled/actions/workflows/packages.yml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush)\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ceb79jn5cf99y3qd/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bjorn/tiled/branch/master)\n[![Snap](https://snapcraft.io/tiled/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/tiled)\n[![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/tiled/-/shields-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/tiled/?utm_source=widget)\n[![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/mapeditor/tiled/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/mapeditor/tiled)\n\nInstalling Tiled\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTiled is available for all major operating systems and can be downloaded either\nfrom [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled/releases) or from\n[itch.io](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled). Most Linux distributions also\npackage Tiled, but these packages are usually out of date so you might prefer\nto use the AppImage or install Tiled through\n[Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/org.mapeditor.Tiled) or\n[snap](https://snapcraft.io/tiled), both of which are official releases.\n\n### Signed Releases for macOS and Windows\n\nmacOS builds are signed by the maintainer, Thorbj\u00f8rn Lindeijer, who registered\nas Apple Developer.\n\nWindows installers are using free code signing provided by\n[SignPath.io](https://signpath.io?utm_source=foundation&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=tiled),\nand a free code signing certificate by the\n[SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org?utm_source=foundation&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=tiled).\n\nCompiling Tiled\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore you can compile Tiled, you must ensure the Qt (>= 5.12) development\nlibraries have been installed as well as the Qbs build tool:\n\n* On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install qtbase5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qttools5-dev-tools zlib1g-dev qtdeclarative5-dev qbs`\n* On Fedora:        `sudo dnf builddep tiled`\n* On Arch Linux:    `sudo pacman -S qt qt5-tools qbs`\n* On macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n  + `brew install qbs` (which automatically pulls in `qt`)\n\nIf you want to build the Python plugin, you additionally need to install the\nPython 3 development libraries:\n\n* On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install python3-dev`\n* On Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/\n\nAlternatively, you can [download Qt here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer).\nYou will still need to install a development environment alongside and some\nlibraries depending on your system, for example:\n\n* On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`\n* On Windows:       Choose \"MinGW\" Qt version, or install Visual Studio\n* On macOS:         Install Xcode\n\nThe easiest way to compile and run Tiled is to open `tiled.qbs` in Qt Creator\nand run the project from there.\n\nFrom the command-line, you may need to set up Qbs before you can build Tiled\n(you will also need to make sure the version of Qt you want to use is in your\npath):\n\n    qbs setup-toolchains --detect     # setup toolchains\n    qbs                               # build Tiled\n\nYou can now run Tiled as follows:\n\n    qbs run -p tiled\n\n### Qt 6\n\nFor compiling libtiledquick (not built by default) you'll need to install the\nVulkan headers:\n\n* On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install libvulkan-dev`\n\n### Working with Visual Studio 2017\n\nOnce Qbs is set up (see previous instructions), it is possible to generate a\nVisual Studio 2017 project with it that allows you to code, compile and run\nusing that IDE. This can be done with the following command:\n\n    qbs generate -g visualstudio2017\n\nInstalling Self-Compiled Tiled\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo install Tiled, run `qbs install` from the terminal. By default, Tiled will\nbe installed to `<build-dir>/install-root`.\n\nThe installation prefix can be changed when building Tiled. For example, to use\nan installation prefix of  `/usr`:\n\n    qbs qbs.installPrefix:\"/usr\"\n\nTo install Tiled to a packaging directory:\n\n    qbs install --install-root /tmp/tiled-pkg\n\nBy default, Tiled and its plugins are compiled with an Rpath that allows them\nto find the shared *libtiled* library immediately after being compiled. When\npackaging Tiled for distribution, the Rpath should be disabled by appending\n`projects.Tiled.useRPaths:false` to the qbs command.\n",
