Emscripten output can run\non the Web, in Node.js, and in\n[wasm runtimes](https://v8.dev/blog/emscripten-standalone-wasm#running-in-wasm-runtimes).\n\nEmscripten provides Web support for popular portable APIs such as OpenGL and\nSDL2, allowing complex graphical native applications to be ported, such as\nthe [Unity game engine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-gettingstarted.html)\nand [Google Earth](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/06/webassembly-brings-google-earth-to-more.html).\nIt can probably port your codebase, too!\n\nWhile Emscripten mostly focuses on compiling C and C++ using\n[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), it can be integrated with other LLVM-using\ncompilers (for example, Rust has Emscripten integration, with the\n`wasm32-unknown-emscripten` and `asmjs-unknown-emscripten` targets).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nEmscripten is available under 2 licenses, the MIT license and the\nUniversity of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License.\n\nBoth are permissive open source licenses, with little if any\npractical difference between them.\n\nThe reason for offering both is that (1) the MIT license is\nwell-known and suitable for a compiler toolchain, while\n(2) LLVM's original license, the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source\nLicense, was also offered to allow Emscripten's code to be integrated\nupstream into LLVM. The second reason became less important after\nEmscripten switched to the LLVM wasm backend, at which point there\nisn't any code we expect to move back and forth between the projects;\nalso, LLVM relicensed to Apache 2.0 + exceptions meanwhile. In practice you\ncan just consider Emscripten as MIT licensed (which allows\nyou to do pretty much anything you want with a compiler, including\ncommercial and non-commercial use).\n\nSee `LICENSE` for the full content of the licenses.\n",
