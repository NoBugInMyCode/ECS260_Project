For support, contribution, and bug reports visit MuseScore.org. Fork and make pull requests!\n\n## Features\n\n- WYSIWYG design, notes are entered on a \"virtual notepaper\"\n- TrueType font(s) for printing & display allows for high quality scaling to all sizes\n- Easy & fast note entry\n- Many editing functions\n- MusicXML import/export\n- MIDI (SMF) import/export\n- MEI import/export\n- MuseData import\n- MIDI input for note entry\n- Integrated sequencer and software synthesizer to play the score\n- Print or create PDF files\n\n## More info\n\n- [MuseScore Homepage](https://musescore.org)\n- [MuseScore Git workflow instructions](https://musescore.org/en/developers-handbook/git-workflow)\n- [How to compile MuseScore?](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki/Set-up-developer-environment)\n\n## License\n\nMuseScore is licensed under GPL version 3.0. See [license file](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) in the same directory.\n\n## Packages\n\nSee [Code Structure on Wiki](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki/CodeStructure)\n\n## Building\n\n**Read the [Compilation section](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki/Set-up-developer-environment) of the [MuseScore Wiki](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki) for a complete build walkthrough and a list of dependencies.**\n\n### Getting sources\n\nIf using git to download repo of entire code history, type:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore.git\n    cd MuseScore\n\nOtherwise, you can just download the latest source release tarball from the [Releases page](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/releases), and then from your download directory type:\n\n    tar xzf MuseScore-x.x.x.tar.gz\n    cd MuseScore-x.x.x\n\n### Release Build\n\nTo compile MuseScore for release, type:\n\n    cmake -P build.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n\nIf something goes wrong, append the word \"clean\" to the above command to delete the build subdirectory:\n\n    cmake -P build.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release clean\n\nThen try running the first command again.\n\n### Running\n\nTo start MuseScore, type:\n\n    cmake -P build.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release run\n\nOr run the compiled executable directly.\n\n### Debug Build\n\nA debug version can be built and run by replacing `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`\nwith `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` in the above commands.\n\nIf you omit the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` option entirely then `RelWithDebInfo` is\nused by default, as it provides a useful compromise between Release and Debug.\n\n### Testing\n\nSee the [Unit tests section](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki/Unit-tests) of the [MuseScore Wiki](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki) for instructions on how to run the test suite.\n\n### Code Formatting\n\nRun `./hooks/install.sh` to install a pre-commit hook that will format your staged files. Requires that you install `uncrustify`.\n\nIf you have problems, please report them. To uninstall, run `./hooks/uninstall.sh`.\n",
