The algorithms span a variety of topics from computer science, mathematics and statistics, data science, machine learning, engineering, etc.. The implementations and their associated documentations are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and students. Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using different algorithm strategies and optimizations.\n\n## Features\n\n* The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in one of the most fundamental general purpose languages - [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).\n* Well documented source code with detailed explanations provide a valuable resource for educators and students alike.\n* Each source code is atomic using standard C library [`libc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) and _no external libraries_ are required for their compilation and execution. Thus the fundamentals of the algorithms can be studied in much depth.\n* Source codes are [compiled and tested](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Awesome+CI+Workflow%22) for every commit on the latest versions of two major operating systems viz., MacOS and Ubuntu (Linux) using AppleClang 14.0.0 and GNU 11.3.0 respectively.\n* Strict adherence to [C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)) standard ensures portability of code to embedded systems as well like ESP32, ARM Cortex, etc. with little to no changes.\n* Self-checks within programs ensure correct implementations with confidence.\n* Modular implementations and OpenSource licensing enable the functions to be utilized conveniently in other applications.\n\n## Documentation\n\n[Online Documentation](https://TheAlgorithms.github.io/C) is generated from the repository source codes directly. The documentation contains all resources including source code snippets, details on execution of the programs, diagrammatic representation of program flow, and links to external resources where necessary.\nClick on [Files menu](https://TheAlgorithms.github.io/C/files.html) to see the list of all the files documented with the code.\n\n[Documentation of Algorithms in C](https://thealgorithms.github.io/C) by [The Algorithms Contributors](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C/graphs/contributors) is licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1)<br/>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left: 3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\" src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg\" /><img  alt=\"Credit must be given to the creator\" style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left: 3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\" src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg\" /><img alt=\"Adaptations must be shared under the same terms\" style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left: 3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\" src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/sa.svg\" /></a>\n\n## Contributions\n\nAs a community developed and maintained repository, we welcome new un-plagiarized quality contributions.
