build status\")\n[![Discourse badge](https://img.shields.io/discourse/users.svg?color=%23f37626&server=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscourse.jupyter.org)](https://discourse.jupyter.org/ \"Jupyter Discourse Forum\")\n[![Binder badge](https://static.mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter/docker-stacks/main?urlpath=lab/tree/README.ipynb \"Launch a quay.io/jupyter/base-notebook container on mybinder.org\")\n\nJupyter Docker Stacks are a set of ready-to-run [Docker images](https://quay.io/organization/jupyter) containing Jupyter applications and interactive computing tools.\nYou can use a stack image to do any of the following (and more):\n\n- Start a personal Jupyter Server with the JupyterLab frontend (default)\n- Run JupyterLab for a team using JupyterHub\n- Start a personal Jupyter Server with the Jupyter Notebook frontend in a local Docker container\n- Write your own project Dockerfile\n\n## Quick Start\n\nYou can [try a relatively recent build of the quay.io/jupyter/base-notebook image on mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter/docker-stacks/main?urlpath=lab/tree/README.ipynb).\nOtherwise, the examples below may help you get started if you [have Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/),\nknow [which Docker image](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html) you want to use, and want to launch a single Jupyter Application in a container.\n\nThe [User Guide on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) describes additional uses and features in detail.\n\n```{note}\nSince `2023-10-20` our images are only pushed to `Quay.io` registry.\nOlder images are available on Docker Hub, but they will no longer be updated.\n```\n\n### Example 1\n\nThis command pulls the `jupyter/scipy-notebook` image tagged `2024-12-23` from Quay.io if it is not already present on the local host.\nIt then starts a container running a Jupyter Server with the JupyterLab frontend and exposes the container's internal port `8888` to port `10000` of the host machine:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 10000:8888 quay.io/jupyter/scipy-notebook:2024-12-23\n```\n\nYou can modify the port on which the container's port is exposed by [changing the value of the `-p` option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/run/#exposed-ports) to `-p 8888:8888`.\n\nVisiting `http://<hostname>:10000/?token=<token>` in a browser loads JupyterLab,\nwhere:\n\n- The `hostname` is the name of the computer running Docker\n- The `token` is the secret token printed in the console.\n\nThe container remains intact for restart after the Server exits.\n\n### Example 2\n\nThis command pulls the `jupyter/datascience-notebook` image tagged `2024-12-23` from Quay.io if it is not already present on the local host.\nIt then starts an _ephemeral_ container running a Jupyter Server with the JupyterLab frontend and exposes the server on host port 10000.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it --rm -p 10000:8888 -v \"${PWD}\":/home/jovyan/work quay.io/jupyter/datascience-notebook:2024-12-23\n```\n\nThe use of the `-v` flag in the command mounts the current working directory on the host (`${PWD}` in the example command) as `/home/jovyan/work` in the container.\nThe server logs appear in the terminal.\n\nVisiting `http://<hostname>:10000/?token=<token>` in a browser loads JupyterLab.\n\nDue to the usage of [the `--rm` flag](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#rm)\nDocker automatically cleans up the container and removes the file system when the container exits,\nbut any changes made to the `~/work` directory and its files in the container will remain intact on the host.\n[The `-i` flag](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#interactive) keeps the container's `STDIN` open, and lets you send input to the container through standard input.\n[The `-t` flag](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#tty) attaches a pseudo-TTY to the container.\n\n```{note}\nBy default, [jupyter's root_dir](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/other/full-config.html) is `/home/jovyan`.\nSo, new notebooks will be saved there, unless you change the directory in the file browser.\n\nTo change the default directory, you must specify `ServerApp.root_dir` by adding this line to the previous command: `start-notebook.py --ServerApp.root_dir=/home/jovyan/work`.\n```\n\n## Choosing Jupyter frontend\n\nJupyterLab is the default for all the Jupyter Docker Stacks images.\nIt is still possible to switch back to Jupyter Notebook (or to launch a different startup command).\nYou can achieve this by passing the environment variable `DOCKER_STACKS_JUPYTER_CMD=notebook` (or any other valid `jupyter` subcommand) at container startup;\nmore information is available in the [documentation](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/common.html#alternative-commands).\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n- [Issue Tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues)\n- [Jupyter Discourse Forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/)\n- [Jupyter Website](https://jupyter.org)\n- [Images on Quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/jupyter)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- Starting from `2022-07-05`, `aarch64` self-hosted runners were sponsored by [`@mathbunnyru`](https://github.com/mathbunnyru/).\n  Please, consider [sponsoring his work](https://github.com/sponsors/mathbunnyru) on GitHub\n- Starting from `2023-10-31`, `aarch64` self-hosted runners are sponsored by an amazing [`2i2c non-profit organization`](https://2i2c.org)\n\n## CPU Architectures\n\n- We publish containers for both `x86_64` and `aarch64` platforms\n- Single-platform images have either `aarch64-` or `x86_64-` tag prefixes, for example, `quay.io/jupyter/base-notebook:aarch64-python-3.11.6`\n- Starting from `2022-09-21`, we create multi-platform images (except `tensorflow-notebook`)\n- Starting from `2023-06-01`, we create a multi-platform `tensorflow-notebook` image as well\n- Starting from `2024-02-24`, we create CUDA enabled variants of `pytorch-notebook` image for `x86_64` platform\n- Starting from `2024-03-26`, we create CUDA enabled variant of `tensorflow-notebook` image for `x86_64` platform\n\n## Using old images\n\nThis project only builds one set of images at a time.\nIf you want to use the older `Ubuntu` and/or `Python` version, you can use the following images:\n\n|
