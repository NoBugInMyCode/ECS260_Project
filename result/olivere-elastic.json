Please update.\n\n**Example:**\n\nYou have installed Elasticsearch 7.0.0 and want to use Elastic.\nAs listed above, you should use Elastic 7.0 (code is in `release-branch.v7`).\n\nTo use the required version of Elastic in your application, you\nshould use [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)\nto manage dependencies. Make sure to use a version such as `7.0.0` or later.\n\nTo use Elastic, import:\n\n```go\nimport \"github.com/olivere/elastic/v7\"\n```\n\n### Elastic 7.0\n\nElastic 7.0 targets Elasticsearch 7.x which [was released on April 10th 2019](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/release-notes-7.0.0.html).\n\nAs always with major version, there are a lot of [breaking changes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/release-notes-7.0.0.html#breaking-7.0.0).\nWe will use this as an opportunity to [clean up and refactor Elastic](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/blob/release-branch.v7/CHANGELOG-7.0.md),\nas we already did in earlier (major) releases.\n\n### Elastic 6.0\n\nElastic 6.0 targets Elasticsearch 6.x which was [released on 14th November 2017](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-6-0-0-released).\n\nNotice that there are a lot of [breaking changes in Elasticsearch 6.0](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/breaking-changes-6.0.html)\nand we used this as an opportunity to [clean up and refactor Elastic](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/blob/release-branch.v6/CHANGELOG-6.0.md)\nas we did in the transition from earlier versions of Elastic.\n\n### Elastic 5.0\n\nElastic 5.0 targets Elasticsearch 5.0.0 and later. Elasticsearch 5.0.0 was\n[released on 26th October 2016](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-5-0-0-released).\n\nNotice that there are will be a lot of [breaking changes in Elasticsearch 5.0](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/breaking-changes-5.0.html)\nand we used this as an opportunity to [clean up and refactor Elastic](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/blob/release-branch.v5/CHANGELOG-5.0.md)\nas we did in the transition from Elastic 2.0 (for Elasticsearch 1.x) to Elastic 3.0 (for Elasticsearch 2.x).\n\nFurthermore, the jump in version numbers will give us a chance to be in sync with the Elastic Stack.\n\n### Elastic 3.0\n\nElastic 3.0 targets Elasticsearch 2.x and is published via [`gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3`](https://gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3).\n\nElastic 3.0 will only get critical bug fixes. You should update to a recent version.\n\n### Elastic 2.0\n\nElastic 2.0 targets Elasticsearch 1.x and is published via [`gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v2`](https://gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v2).\n\nElastic 2.0 will only get critical bug fixes. You should update to a recent version.\n\n### Elastic 1.0\n\nElastic 1.0 is deprecated. You should really update Elasticsearch and Elastic\nto a recent version.\n\nHowever, if you cannot update for some reason, don't worry. Version 1.0 is\nstill available. All you need to do is go-get it and change your import path\nas described above.\n\n\n## Status\n\nWe use Elastic in production since 2012. Elastic is stable but the API changes\nnow and then. We strive for API compatibility.\nHowever, Elasticsearch sometimes introduces [breaking changes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/breaking-changes.html)\nand we sometimes have to adapt.\n\nHaving said that, there have been no big API changes that required you\nto rewrite your application big time. More often than not it's renaming APIs\nand adding/removing features so that Elastic is in sync with Elasticsearch.\n\nElastic has been used in production starting with Elasticsearch 0.90 up to recent 7.x\nversions.\nWe recently switched to [GitHub Actions for testing](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/actions).\nBefore that, we used [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/olivere/elastic) successfully for years).\n\nElasticsearch has quite a few features. Most of them are implemented\nby Elastic. I add features and APIs as required. It's straightforward\nto implement missing pieces. I'm accepting pull requests :-)\n\nHaving said that, I hope you find the project useful.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe first thing you do is to create a [Client](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/blob/master/client.go).\nThe client connects to Elasticsearch on `http://127.0.0.1:9200` by default.\n\nYou typically create one client for your app. Here's a complete example of\ncreating a client, creating an index, adding a document, executing a search etc.\n\nAn example is available [here](https://olivere.github.io/elastic/).\n\nHere's a [link to a complete working example for v6](https://gist.github.com/olivere/e4a376b4783c0914e44ea4f745ce2ebf).\n\nHere are a few tips on how to get used to Elastic:\n\n1. Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/wiki) for detailed information and\n   topics like e.g. [how to add a middleware](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/wiki/HttpTransport)\n   or how to [connect to AWS](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/wiki/Using-with-AWS-Elasticsearch-Service).\n2. If you are unsure how to implement something, read the tests (all `_test.go` files).\n   They not only serve as a guard against changes, but also as a reference.\n3. The [recipes](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/tree/release-branch.v6/recipes)\n   contains small examples on how to implement something, e.g. bulk indexing, scrolling etc.\n\n\n## API Status\n\n### Document APIs\n\n- [x] Index API\n- [x] Get API\n- [x] Delete API\n- [x] Delete By Query API\n- [x] Update API\n- [x] Update By Query API\n- [x] Multi Get API\n- [x] Bulk API\n- [x] Reindex API\n- [x] Term Vectors\n- [x] Multi termvectors API\n\n### Search APIs\n\n- [x] Search\n- [x] Search Template\n- [ ] Multi Search Template\n- [x] Search Shards API\n- [x] Suggesters\n  -
