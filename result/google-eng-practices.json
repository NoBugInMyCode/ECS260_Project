        "readme": "# Google Engineering Practices Documentation\n\nGoogle has many generalized engineering practices that cover all languages and\nall projects. These documents represent our collective experience of various\nbest practices that we have developed over time. It is possible that open source\nprojects or other organizations would benefit from this knowledge, so we work to\nmake it available publicly when possible.\n\nCurrently this contains the following documents:\n\n*   [Google's Code Review Guidelines](review/index.md), which are actually two\n    separate sets of documents:\n    *   [The Code Reviewer's Guide](review/reviewer/index.md)\n    *   [The Change Author's Guide](review/developer/index.md)\n\n## Terminology\n\nThere is some Google-internal terminology used in some of these documents, which\nwe clarify here for external readers:\n\n*   **CL**: Stands for \"changelist\", which means one self-contained change that\n    has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.\n    Other organizations often call this a \"change\", \"patch\", or \"pull-request\".\n*   **LGTM**: Means \"Looks Good to Me\". It is what a code reviewer says when\n    approving a CL.\n\n## License\n\nThe documents in this project are licensed under the\n[CC-By 3.0 License](LICENSE), which encourages you to share these documents. See\n<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/> for more details.\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/3.0/88x31.png\" /></a>\n",
