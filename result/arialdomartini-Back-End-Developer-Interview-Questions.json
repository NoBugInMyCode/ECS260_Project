        "readme": "Back-End Developer Interview Questions\n======================================\n\nThis page has been translated to [Chinese](https://github.com/monklof/Back-End-Developer-Interview-Questions) by [monklof](https://github.com/monklof).\n\nI started writing down this list as my personal notes of topics I discussed with colleagues and friends, and that I wanted to deepen...\n\nI'm not a big fan of asking technical questions in job interviews: I rather prefer to sit together with candidates in front of some real code, hands on the keyboard, facing a real problem, and to have a full day of pair programming, hopefully rotating with all the other team members. It is one of the best opportunities to know each others' style and to let candidates know some details about their future job.\n\nYet, I feel some categories of technical questions could be a good starting point to begin an engaging conversation. \n\nThis repo collects a number of back-end related questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question on the same candidate: that would take hours, and would have no sense at all, as they cover a too broad set of topics for a single developer's to possibly know. Browse the section you find more relevant for your context, and pick the questions that give you more ideas on the conversation to have.\n\nThis project is admittedly inspired by [Front-end Job Interview Questions](https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) by [@darcyclarke](https://github.com/darcyclarke)\n\n## Where are the answers?\nI didn't include any.<br/>\nMost of the questions are open-ended, and some of them just don't have a *right* or a *wrong* answer. On the contrary, they are intended to be used as the starting point for a conversation that hopefully tells you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would. Personally, I would even choose the questions whose answers are not yet clear to me.\n\nFeel free to open a [Discussion](https://github.com/arialdomartini/Back-End-Developer-Interview-Questions/discussions).\n\n\n\n\n\n## <a name='toc'>Table of Contents</a>\n\n* [Questions about Design

Are Evil\nWhy are global and static objects evil? Can you show it with a code example?\n\n#### Inversion of Control\nTell me about Inversion of Control and how it improves the design of code.<br/>\n[Resources](design-patterns/inversion-of-control.md)\n\n\n#### Law of Demeter\nThe Law of Demeter (the Principle of Least Knowledge) states that each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units and it should only talk to its immediate friends (sometimes stated as \"don't talk to strangers\").<br/>\nWould you write code violating this principle, show why it is a bad design and then fix it?<br/>\n[Resources](design-patterns/law-of-demeter.md)\n\n#### Active-Record\nActive-Record is the design pattern that promotes objects to include functions such as Insert, Update, and Delete, and properties that correspond to the columns in some underlying database table. In your opinion and experience, which are the limits and pitfalls of the this pattern?<br/>\n[Resources](design-patterns/active-record.md)\n\n#### Data-Mapper\nData-Mapper is a design pattern that promotes the use of a layer of Mappers that moves data between objects and a database while keeping them independent of each other and the mapper itself. On the contrary, in Active-Record objects directly incorporate operations for persisting themselves to a database, and properties corresponding to the underlying database tables. Do you have an opinion on those patterns? When would you use one instead of the other?\n\n#### Billion Dollar Mistake\n[Tony Hoare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare) who invented the null reference once said \"*I call it my billion-dollar mistake*\" since it led to \"*innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years*\".\n\nWould you discuss the techniques to avoid it, such as the Null Object Pattern introduced by the GOF book, or Option types?\n\n#### Inheritance vs Composition\nMany state that, in Object-Oriented Programming, composition is often a better option than inheritance. What's you opinion?\n\n#### Anti-Corruption Layer\nWhat is an Anti-corruption Layer?\n\n#### Singleton\nSingleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single object. Writing a Thread-Safe Singleton class is not so obvious. Would you try?\n\n#### Data Abstraction\nThe ability to change implementation without affecting clients is called Data Abstraction. Produce an example violating this property, then fix it.\n\n#### Don't Repeat Yourself\nWrite a snippet of code violating the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. Then, fix it.\n\n#### Dependency Hell\nHow would you deal with Dependency Hell?\n\n#### Goto is Evil\nIs goto evil? You may have heard of the famous paper \"Go To Statement Considered Harmful\" by Edsger Dijkstra, in which he criticized the use of the `goto` statement and advocated structured programming instead. The use of `goto` has always been controversial, so much that even Dijkstra's letter was criticized with articles such as \"'GOTO Considered Harmful' Considered Harmful\". What's your opinion on the use of `goto`?\n\n#### Robustness Principle\nThe robustness principle is a general design guideline for software that recommends \"*be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept*\". It is often reworded as \"*be a tolerant reader and a careful writer*\". Would you like to discuss the rationale of this principle?\n\n#### Separation of Concerns\nSeparation of Concerns is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct areas, each one addressing a separate concern. There are a lot of different mechanisms for achieving Separation of Concerns (use of objects, functions, modules, or patterns such as MVC and the like). Would you discuss this topic?\n\n\n### [[\u2191]](#toc) <a name='design'>Questions about Code Design:</a>\n\n#### High Cohesion, Loose Coupling\nIt is often said that one of the most important goals in Object-Oriented Design (and code design in general) is to have High Cohesion and Loose Coupling. What does it mean? Why is it that important and how is it achieved?\n\n#### Index 0\nWhy do array indexes start with '0' in most languages?\n\n#### TDD\nHow do tests and TDD influence code design?\n\n#### DRY Violation\nWrite a snippet of code violating the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. Then, explain why it is a bad design, and fix it.\n\n#### Cohesion vs Coupling\nWhat's the difference between cohesion and coupling?\n\n#### Refactoring\nWhat is refactoring useful for?\n\n#### Code Comments\nAre comments in code useful? Some say they should be avoided as much as possible, and hopefully made unnecessary. Do you agree?\n\n#### Design vs Architecture\nWhat is the difference between design and architecture?\n\n#### Early Testing\nIn TDD, why are tests written before code?\n\n#### Multiple Inheritance\nC++ supports multiple inheritance, and Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces. What impact does using these facilities have on orthogonality? Is there a difference in impact between using multiple inheritance and multiple interfaces? Is there a difference between using delegation and using inheritance? [This question is from The Pragmatic Programmer, by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas]\n\n#### Domain Logic in Stored Procedures\nWhat are the pros and cons of holding domain logic in Stored Procedures?\n\n#### OOP Took Over the World\nIn your opinion, why has Object-Oriented Design dominated the market for so many years?\n\n#### Bad Design\nWhat would you do to understand if your code has a bad design?\n\n\n### [[\u2191]](#toc) <a name='languages'>Questions about Languages:</a>\n\n#### 3 worst defects\nTell me the 3 worst defects of your preferred language\n\n#### Functional Programming\nWhy is there a rising interest on Functional Programming?\n\n#### Closures\nWhat is a closure, and what is useful for? What's in common between closures and classes?\n\n#### Generics\nWhat are generics useful for?\n\n#### High-Order Functions\nWhat are higher-order functions? What are they useful for? Write one, in your preferred language.\n\n#### Loops and Recursion\nWrite a loop, then transform it into a recursive function, using only immutable structures (i.e. avoid using variables). Discuss.\n\n#### Functions as First-Class Citizens\nWhat does it mean when a language treats functions as first-class citizens?\nWhy is it important that in a language functions are first-class citizens?\n\n#### Anonymous Functions\nShow me an example where an anonymous function can be useful.\n\n#### Static and Dynamic typing\nThere are a lot of different type systems. Let's talk about static and dynamic type systems, and about strong and weak ones. You surely have an opinion and a preference about this topic. Would you like to share them, and discuss why and when would you promote one particular type system for developing an enterprise software?\n\n#### Namespaces\nWhat are namespaces useful for? Invent an alternative.\n\n#### Language Interoperability\nTalk about interoperability between Java and C# (in alternative, choose 2 other arbitrary languages)\n\n#### Hate of Java\nWhy do many software engineers not like Java?\n\n#### Good and Bad Languages\nWhat makes a good language good and a bad language bad?\n\n#### Referential Transparency\nWrite two functions, one referentially transparent and the other one referentially opaque. Discuss.\n\n#### Stack and Heap\nWhat is a stack and what is a heap? What's a stack overflow?\n\n#### Pattern Matching\nSome languages, especially the ones that promote a functional approach, allow a technique called pattern matching. Do you know it? How is pattern matching different from switch clauses?\n\n#### Exceptions\nWhy do some languages have no exceptions by design? What are the pros and cons?\n\n#### Variant and Contravariant Inheritance\nIf `Cat` is an `Animal`, is `TakeCare<Cat>` a `TakeCare<Animal>`?\n\n#### Constructors and Interfaces\nIn Java, C# and many other languages, why are constructors not part of the interface?\n\n#### Node.js\nIn the last years there has been a lot of hype around Node.js. What's your opinion on using a language that was initially conceived to run in the browser in the backend?\n\n#### Java and time-traveling\n* Pretend you have a time machine and pretend that you have the opportunity to go to a particular point in time during Java's (or C#, Python, Go or whatever) history, and talk with some of the JDK architects. What would you try to convince them of? Removing checked exceptions? Adding unsigned primitives? Adding multiple-inheritance?\n#### Eliminate Null\nImagine you want to remove the possibility to have null references in your preferred language: how would you achieve this goal? What consequences would this have?\n\n\n### [[\u2191]](#toc) <a name='web'>Questions about Web development:</a>\n\n#### 3rd Party Cookies\nWhy are first-party cookies and third-party cookies treated so differently?\n\n#### API Versioning\nHow would you manage Web Services API versioning?\n\n#### SPAs\nFrom a backend perspective, are there any disadvantages or drawbacks on the adoption of Single Page Applications?\n\n#### Statelessness\nWhy do we usually put so much effort for having stateless services? What's so good in stateless code and why and when is statefulness bad?\n\n#### REST vs SOAP\nREST and SOAP: when would you choose one, and when the other?\n\n#### MVC and MVVM\nIn web development, Model-View Controller and Model-View-View-Model approaches are very common, both in the backend and in the frontend. What are they, and why are they advisable?\n\n\n### [[\u2191]](#toc) <a name='databases'>Questions about Databases:</a>\n\n#### DB Migrations\nHow would you migrate an application from a database to another, for example from MySQL to PostgreSQL? If you had to manage that project, which issues would you expect to face?\n\n#### NULL is special\nWhy do databases treat null as a so special case? For example, why does ```SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = null``` not match records with null ``field`` in SQL?\n\n#### ACID\nACID is an acronym that refers to Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability, 4 properties guaranteed by a database transaction in most database engines. What do you know about this topic? Would you like to elaborate?\n\n#### Schema Migrations\nHow would you manage database schema migrations? That is, how would you automate changes to database schema, as the application evolves, version after version?\n\n#### Lazy Loading\nHow is lazy loading achieved? When is it useful? What are its pitfalls?\n\n#### N+1 Problem\nThe so called \"N + 1 problem\" is an issue that occurs when code needs to load the children of a parent-child relationship with a ORMs that have lazy-loading enabled, and that therefore issue a query for the parent record, and then one query for each child record. How to fix it?\n\n#### Slowest Queries\nHow would you find the most expensive queries in an application?\n\n#### Normalization\nIn your opinion, is it always needed to use database normalization? When is it advisable to use denormalized databases?\n\n#### Blue/Green Deployment\nOne of the Continuous Integration's techniques is called Blue-Green Deployment: it consists in having two production environments, as identical as possible, and in performing the deployment in one of them while the other one is still operating, and than in safely switching the traffic to the second one after some convenient testing.
