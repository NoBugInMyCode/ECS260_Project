This also assumes a response size of 4242 bytes for invalid GET parameter name.\n\n```\nffuf -w /path/to/paramnames.txt -u https://target/script.php?FUZZ=test_value -fs 4242\n```\n\nIf the parameter name is known, the values can be fuzzed the same way. This example assumes a wrong parameter value returning HTTP response code 401.\n\n```\nffuf -w /path/to/values.txt -u https://target/script.php?valid_name=FUZZ -fc 401\n```\n\n### POST data fuzzing\n\nThis is a very straightforward operation, again by using the `FUZZ` keyword. This example is fuzzing only part of the POST request. We're again filtering out the 401 responses.\n\n```\nffuf -w /path/to/postdata.txt -X POST -d \"username=admin\\&password=FUZZ\" -u https://target/login.php -fc 401\n```\n\n### Maximum execution time\n\nIf you don't want ffuf to run indefinitely, you can use the `-maxtime`. This stops __the entire__ process after a given time (in seconds).\n\n```\nffuf -w /path/to/wordlist -u https://target/FUZZ -maxtime 60\n```\n\nWhen working with recursion, you can control the maxtime __per job__ using `-maxtime-job`. This will stop the current job after a given time (in seconds) and continue with the next one. New jobs are created when the recursion functionality detects a subdirectory.\n\n```\nffuf -w /path/to/wordlist -u https://target/FUZZ -maxtime-job 60 -recursion -recursion-depth 2\n```\n\nIt is also possible to combine both flags limiting the per job maximum execution time as well as the overall execution time. If you do not use recursion then both flags behave equally.\n\n### Using external mutator to produce test cases\n\nFor this example, we'll fuzz JSON data that's sent over POST. [Radamsa](https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa) is used as the mutator.\n\nWhen `--input-cmd` is used, ffuf will display matches as their position. This same position value will be available for the callee as an environment variable `$FFUF_NUM`. We'll use this position value as the seed for the mutator. Files example1.txt and example2.txt contain valid JSON payloads. We are matching all the responses, but filtering out response code `400 - Bad request`:\n\n```\nffuf --input-cmd 'radamsa --seed $FFUF_NUM example1.txt example2.txt' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST -u https://ffuf.io.fi/FUZZ -mc all -fc 400\n```\n\nIt of course isn't very efficient to call the mutator for each payload, so we can also pre-generate the payloads, still using [Radamsa](https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa) as an example:\n\n```\n# Generate 1000 example payloads\nradamsa -n 1000 -o %n.txt example1.txt example2.txt\n\n# This results into files 1.txt ... 1000.txt\n# Now we can just read the payload data in a loop from file for ffuf\n\nffuf --input-cmd 'cat $FFUF_NUM.txt' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST -u https://ffuf.io.fi/ -mc all -fc 400\n```\n\n### Configuration files\n\nWhen running ffuf, it first checks if a default configuration file exists. Default path for a `ffufrc` file is\n`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ffuf/ffufrc`.  You can configure one or multiple options in this file, and they will be applied on \nevery subsequent ffuf job. An example of ffufrc file can be found \n[here](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf/blob/master/ffufrc.example). \n\nA more detailed description about configuration file locations can be found in the wiki: \n[https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf/wiki/Configuration](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf/wiki/Configuration)\n\nThe configuration options provided on the command line override the ones loaded from the default `ffufrc` file.\nNote: this does not apply for CLI flags that can be provided more than once. One of such examples is `-H` (header) flag.\nIn this case, the `-H` values provided on the command line will be _appended_ to the ones from the config file instead.\n\nAdditionally, in case you wish to use bunch of configuration files for different use cases, you can do this by defining\nthe configuration file path using `-config` command line flag that takes the file path to the configuration file as its\nparameter. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"250\" src=\"_img/ffuf_juggling_250.png\">\n</p>\n\n## Usage\n\nTo define the test case for ffuf, use the keyword `FUZZ` anywhere in the URL (`-u`), headers (`-H`), or POST data (`-d`).\n\n```\nFuzz Faster U Fool - v2.1.0\n\nHTTP OPTIONS:\n  -H                  Header `\"Name: Value\"`, separated by colon.
