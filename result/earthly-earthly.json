It has a super simple, instantly recognizable syntax that is easy to write and understand \u2013 like Dockerfile and Makefile had a baby. And it leverages and augments popular build tools instead of replacing them, so you don\u2019t have to rewrite all your builds no matter what languages you use.\n\n<br/>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://earthly.dev/get-earthly\"><img src=\"docs/img/get-earthly-button.png\" alt=\"Get Earthly\" title=\"Get Earthly\" /></a></div>\n\n---------------------------------\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Table of Contents</h2>\n\n* [Why use Earthly?](#why-use-earthly)\n* [Where Does Earthly Fit?](#where-does-earthly-fit)\n* [How Does It Work?](#how-does-it-work)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n* [Features](#features)\n* [FAQ](#faq)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n* [Licensing](#licensing)\n\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Why Use Earthly?</h2>\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 Repeatable Builds\n\nEarthly runs all builds in containers, making them self-contained, isolated, repeatable, and portable. This allows for faster iteration on build scripts and easier debugging when something goes wrong \u2013 no more `git commit -m \"try again\"`. When you write a build, you know it will execute correctly no matter where it runs \u2013 your laptop, a colleague\u2019s laptop, or any CI. You don\u2019t have to configure language-specific tooling, install additional dependencies, or complicate your build scripts to ensure they are compatible with different OSs. Earthly gives you consistent, repeatable builds regardless of where they run.\n\n\n### \u2764\ufe0f Super Simple\n\nEarthly\u2019s syntax is easy to write and understand. Most engineers can read an Earthfile instantly, without prior knowledge of Earthly. We combined some of the best ideas from Dockerfiles and Makefiles into one specification \u2013 like Dockerfile and Makefile had a baby.\n\n\n### \ud83d\udee0 Compatible with Every Language, Framework, and Build Tool\n\nEarthly works with the compilers and build tools you use. If it runs on Linux, it runs on Earthly. And you don\u2019t have to rewrite your existing builds or replace your `package.json`, `go.mod`, `build.gradle`, or `Cargo.toml` files. You can use Earthly as a wrapper around your existing tooling and still get Earthly\u2019s repeatable builds, parallel execution, and build caching.\n\n\n### \ud83c\udfd8 Great for Monorepos and Polyrepos\n\nEarthly is great for both monorepos and polyrepos. You can split your build logic across multiple Earthfiles, placing some deeper inside the directory structure or even in other repositories. Referencing targets from other Earthfiles is easy regardless of where they are stored. So you can organize your build logic however makes the most sense for your project.\n\n\n### \ud83d\udca8 Fast Builds\n\nEarthly automatically executes build targets in parallel and makes maximum use of cache. This makes builds fast. Earthly also has powerful shared caching capabilities that speed up builds frequently run across a team or in sandboxed environments, such as Earthly Satellites, GitHub Actions, or your CI.\n\nIf your build has multiple steps, Earthly will:\n1. Build a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\n2. Isolate execution of each step.\n3. Run independent steps in parallel.\n4. Cache results for future use.\n\n\n### \u267b\ufe0f Reuse, Don't Repeat\n\nNever have to write the same code in multiple builds again. With Earthly, you can reuse targets, artifacts, and images across multiple Earthfiles, even ones in other repositories, in a single line. Earthly is cache-aware, based on the individual hashes of each file, and has shared caching capabilities. So you can create a vast and efficient build hierarchy that only executes the minimum required steps.\n\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Where Does Earthly Fit?</h2>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"docs/img/integration-diagram-v2.png\" alt=\"Earthly fits between language-specific tooling and the CI\" width=\"700px\" /></div>\n\nEarthly is meant to be used both on your development machine and in CI. It runs on top of your CI/CD platform (such as [Jenkins](https://docs.earthly.dev/ci-integration/vendor-specific-guides/jenkins), [Circle CI](https://docs.earthly.dev/examples/circle-integration), [GitHub Actions](https://docs.earthly.dev/examples/gh-actions-integration), and [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.earthly.dev/ci-integration/vendor-specific-guides/gitlab-integration)). Earthly provides the benefits of a modern build automation system wherever it runs \u2013 such as caching and parallelism. It is a glue layer between language-specific build tooling (like maven, gradle, npm, pip, go build) and CI, working like a wrapper around your build tooling and build logic that isolates build execution from the environments they run in.\n\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">How Does It Work?</h2>\n\nIn short: **containers**, **layer caching**, and **complex build graphs**!\n\nEarthly executes builds in containers, where execution is isolated. The dependencies of the build are explicitly specified in the build definition, thus making the build self-sufficient.\n\nWe use a target-based system to help users break up complex builds into reusable parts. Nothing is shared between targets other than clearly declared dependencies. Nothing shared means no unexpected race conditions. In fact, the build is executed in parallel whenever possible, without any need for the user to take care of any locking or unexpected environment interactions.\n\n> **\u2139\ufe0f Note**\n> Earthfiles might seem very similar to Dockerfile multi-stage builds. In fact, the [same technology](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) is used underneath. However, a key difference is that Earthly is designed to be a general-purpose build system, not just a Docker image specification.

Earthly takes some key principles of Dockerfiles (like layer caching) but expands on the use cases. For example, Earthly can output regular artifacts, run unit and integration tests, and create several Docker images at a time - all outside the scope of Dockerfiles.\n\nIt is possible to use Dockerfiles in combination with other technologies (e.g., Makefiles or bash files) to solve such use cases. However, these combinations are difficult to parallelize, challenging to scale across repositories as they lack a robust import system, and often vary in style from one team to another. Earthly does not have these limitations as it was designed as a general-purpose build system.\n\nFor example, Earthly introduces a richer target, artifact, and image [referencing system](https://docs.earthly.dev/docs/guides/target-ref), allowing for better reuse in complex builds spanning a single large repository or multiple repositories. Because Dockerfiles are only meant to describe one image at a time, such features are outside the scope of applicability of Dockerfiles.\n\n### How do I know if a command is a classic Dockerfile command or an Earthly command?\n\nCheck out the [Earthfile reference doc page](https://docs.earthly.dev/docs/earthfile). It has all the commands there and specifies which commands are the same as Dockerfile commands and which are new.\n\n### Can Earthly build Dockerfiles?\n\nYes! You can use the command `FROM DOCKERFILE` to inherit the commands in an existing Dockerfile.\n\n```earthly\nbuild:\n  FROM DOCKERFILE .\n  SAVE IMAGE some-image:latest\n```\n\nYou may also optionally port your Dockerfiles to Earthly entirely. Translating Dockerfiles to Earthfiles is usually a matter of copy-pasting and making minor adjustments. See the [getting started page](https://docs.earthly.dev/basics) for some Earthfile examples.\n\n### How is Earthly different from Bazel?\n\n[Bazel](https://bazel.build) is a build tool developed by Google to optimize the speed, correctness, and reproducibility of their internal monorepo codebase. The main difference between Bazel and Earthly is that Bazel is a **build system**, whereas Earthly is a **general-purpose CI/CD framework**.
