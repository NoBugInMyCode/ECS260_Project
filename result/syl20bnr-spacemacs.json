You can also press the home buffer's\n`[?]` button for some great first key bindings to try.\n\nSpacemacs can be used naturally by both Emacs and Vim users -- you can even mix\nthe two editing styles. Being able to quickly switch between input styles, makes\nSpacemacs a great tool for pair-programming.\n\nSpacemacs is currently in beta, and any contributions are very welcome.\n\n![spacemacs_python](doc/img/spacemacs-python.png)\n\n# Features\n- **Great documentation:** access the Spacemacs documentation with\n<kbd>SPC h SPC</kbd>.\n- **Beautiful GUI:** you'll love the distraction free UI and its functional\nmode-line.\n- **Excellent ergonomics:** all the key bindings are accessible by pressing the\n<kbd>SPC</kbd> or <kbd>Alt-m</kbd>.\n- **Mnemonic key bindings:** commands have mnemonic prefixes like\n<kbd>SPC b</kbd> for all the buffer commands or <kbd>SPC p</kbd> for the project\ncommands.\n- **Batteries included:** discover hundreds of ready-to-use packages nicely\norganized in configuration layers following a set of [conventions\n][CONVENTIONS.org].\n\n# Documentation\nComprehensive documentation is available for each layer by pressing <kbd>SPC h\nSPC</kbd>.\n\nYou can also check the [general documentation][DOCUMENTATION.org],\n[quick start guide][QUICK_START.org] and the [FAQ][FAQ.org].\n\n# Getting Help\nIf you need help, ask your questions in the [Gitter Chat][] and a member of the\ncommunity will help you out.\n\nIf you prefer IRC, connect to the [Gitter Chat IRC server][] and join the\n`#syl20bnr/spacemacs` channel.\n\nLast but not least there are a lot of high class tutorials available on YouTube:\n* Jack of Some's [Spacemacs tutorial videos][jack-of-some].\n* GDQuest's [Game Design oriented tutorials ][gdquest] to Spacemacs.\n* Practicalli's [Clojure tutorials based on Spacemacs][practicalli].\n* Eivind Fonn's classic [Spacemacs ABC][eivind-fonn].\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n1. A package manager if the OS doesn't have one already.\n\n2. Spacemacs is an extension of a popular text editor called [Emacs][GNU Emacs].\n   So you'll need Emacs installed first.\n\n   Spacemacs requires Emacs 28.2 or above. The development version of Emacs is\n   not *officially* supported, but it should nevertheless be expected to work.\n\n3. [git][Git] is required to download and update Spacemacs.\n\n4. Tar, in particular [GNU Tar][], is required to install and update Emacs\n   packages used by Spacemacs.\n\n5. *(Optional)* The default font used by Spacemacs is [Source Code Pro][]. You\n   may customize your own font settings and choose another font. If you want to\n   use this default font, it must be installed.\n\n   Spacemacs also uses fallback fonts to ensure certain Unicode symbols it uses\n   symbols appear correctly. The fonts used are determined by the OS:\n\n   - Linux: [Nanum Gothic][]\n   - macOS: [Arial Unicode MS][]\n   - Windows: [MS Gothic][] and [Lucida Sans Unicode][]\n\n   If the mode-line doesn't look similar to the [picture at the top of this\n   page](#introduction), make sure you have the correct fallback font installed.\n\n6. *(Optional)* Various commands in Spacemacs needs one of the following line\n   searching program:\n\n   - [ripgrep (rg)][ripgrep]\n   - [The silver searcher (ag)][ag]\n   - [The platinum searcher (pt)][pt]\n   - [ack][]\n   - [GNU Grep][] or [BSD Grep][]\n\n   Grep is very slow but it's widely available on most systems and is used as an\n   fallback option.\n\n   We strongly recommend [ripgrep][] over other line searching programs, for its\n   blazing fast speed. The following subsections helps you to install it.\n\n### Linux\n\n1. Most Linux distribution ships a package manager already and if this is the\n   case you are all set for this step.\n\n   If it doesn't, you may need to build the softwares mentioned below from their\n   sources.\n\n2. In most distributions, Emacs is installed via an `emacs` package from the\n   package manager.\n\n   **N.B.** DO not install [XEmacs][] because it's not supported by Spacemacs.\n   XEmacs is an old fork of Emacs with various [subtle\n   differences][Emacs And XEmacs].\n\n   **N.B.** Some Linux distributions support only Emacs versions older than\n   28.2. In this case you should\n   [build it from source][Build Emacs from Source] instead.\n\n3. Very likely Git is already installed on your system. Otherwise, you should\n   be able to install `git` from your system's package manager.\n\n4. Very likely Tar is already installed on your system. Otherwise, you should\n   be able to install `tar` from your system's package manager.\n\n5. *(Optional)* If Nerd Fonts and Nanum Gothic are available from your\n   distribution's package manager, you should install it there.\n\n   Otherwise, the generic way to install it is:\n\n   1. Download the latest pre-built `TTF` font from\n      <https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/latest> and\n      <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Gothic>.\n\n   2. Extract the archive and move the font files to `~/.fonts`.\n\n   3. Refresh font cache with:\n\n   ```sh\n   fc-cache -fv\n   ```\n\n6. *(Optional)* If your distribution is listed [here][ripgrep-installation],\n   follow the instructions. Otherwise, you can download its pre-built binary or\n   build it from source.\n\n### macOS\n\n1. The most popular package manager on macOS is [Homebrew][], to install it:\n\n   ```sh\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n2. Several options exist for installing Emacs on macOS:\n\n   1. [Emacs Plus][] features [additional functionalities][Emacs Plus features]\n      over base Emacs.\n\n      ```sh\n      brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus\n\n      # install latest stable release, with Spacemacs icon and native compilation\n      brew install emacs-plus --with-spacemacs-icon --with-native-comp\n      ```\n\n      You will require the latest version of Xcode Command Line tools, which can be\n      downloaded from the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/)\n      or by running the following command:\n\n      ```sh\n      softwareupdate --all --install --force\n      ```\n\n   2. [Emacs Mac Port][] adds native GUI support to Emacs 28. And the full list\n      of features is available [here][Emacs Mac Port features].\n\n      ```sh\n      brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport\n      brew install emacs-mac\n      ```\n\n   3. [Emacs for Mac OS X][] is the binary build of GNU Emacs, *without* any\n      extra feature.\n\n      ```sh\n      brew install --cask emacs\n      ```\n\n3. To install `git`:\n\n   ```sh\n   brew install git\n   ```\n\n4. macOS ships with [BSD Tar][], but there are reports of weird issues so we\n   require [GNU Tar][] instead.\n\n   ```sh\n   brew install gnu-tar\n   ```\n\n5. *(Optional)* To install Source Code Pro Font:\n\n   ```sh\n   brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts\n   brew install --cask font-source-code-pro\n   ```\n\n   Arial Unicode MS is shipped with macOS v10.5 and later so you don't need to\n   install it manually.\n\n6. *(Optional)* You can install `ripgrep` via `Homebrew`:\n\n   ```sh\n   brew install ripgrep\n   ```\n\n### Windows\nWe recommend using wsl2 with wslg support especially with a pgtk build of emacs and wayland.\nFor the installation please refer to the linux installation section. When running emacs\nwithin your wsl2 environment emacs will be handled like any other windows application.\n\nIf this is not possible you can fallback to a native windows installation, however note\nthat this will create a lot of subtle bugs especially with tls which we will most likely\nnot be able to help with.\n\nIf you need to follow that path we recommend to at least use a package manager like\n[Scoop][] to install the needed packages.\n\n1. You can install [Scoop][] via PowerShell:\n\n   ```powershell\n   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser # Optional: Needed to run a remote script the first time\n   irm get.scoop.sh | iex\n   ```\n\n2. Emacs can be installed in PowerShell:\n\n   ```powershell\n   scoop bucket add extras\n   scoop install emacs\n   ```\n\n3. To install `git` in PowerShell:\n\n   ```powershell\n   scoop bucket add main\n   scoop install git\n   ```\n\n4. Windows 10 build 17063 and later ships with [BSD Tar][], but it's required to\n   install [GNU Tar][] instead to avoid possible issues. Alternatively, if\n   you are running an earlier version of Windows, Tar isn't installed. In either\n   case, you can install GNU Tar via:\n\n   ```powershell\n   scoop bucket add main\n   scoop install tar\n   ```\n\n5. To install Source Code Pro Font in PowerShell:\n\n   ```powershell\n   scoop bucket add KnotUntied_scoop-fonts https://github.com/KnotUntied/scoop-fonts\n   scoop install sourcecodepro\n   ```\n\n   MS Gothic and Lucida Sans Unicode are shipped with Windows 2003 and later so\n   you don't need to install it manually.\n\n6. *(Optional)* You can install `ripgrep` in PowerShell:\n\n   ```powershell\n   scoop bucket add main\n   scoop install ripgrep\n   ```\n\n# Install\n\n## Default Install\n\n1. The default installation downloads Spacemacs to the `.emacs.d` directory in\n   your `HOME` directory.\n\n   But in the case of Windows, `HOME` is not set out-of-box. We recommend you to\n   set it as an environment variable, with the same value as environment\n   variable `HOMEPATH`, which usually looks like `C:\\Users\\<username>`.\n\n2. Since Spacemacs will now be downloaded at `$HOME/.emacs.d`, if it already\n   exists it'll be overridden.\n\n   Also, if you have either `$HOME/.emacs.el` or `$HOME/.emacs`, they will\n   appear before Spacemacs in Emacs's initialization steps. Thus they must be\n   renamed in order for Spacemacs to load correctly.\n\n   To backup/rename the aforementioned files/directory, in shell:\n\n   ```sh\n   [ -d $HOME/.emacs.d ] && mv $HOME/.emacs.d $HOME/.emacs.d.bak\n   [ -f $HOME/.emacs.el ] && mv $HOME/.emacs.el .emacs.el.bak\n   [ -f $HOME/.emacs ] && mv $HOME/.emacs $HOME/.emacs.bak\n   ```\n\n    or in PowerShell:\n\n    ```powershell\n    if( Test-Path -Path $HOME/.emacs.d )\n    {\n        Rename-Item $HOME/.emacs.d $HOME/.emacs.d.bak\n    }\n    if( Test-Path -Path $HOME/.emacs.el )\n    {\n        Rename-Item $HOME/.emacs.el $HOME/.emacs.el.bak\n    }\n    if( Test-Path -Path $HOME/.emacs )\n    {\n        Rename-Item $HOME/.emacs $HOME/.emacs.bak\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. Now clone this repository with Git. The following work for both shell\n   and PowerShell:\n\n   ```sh\n   git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs $HOME/.emacs.d\n   ```\n\n   In case you have a limited internet connection or limited speed:\n\n   ```sh\n   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d\n   ```\n\n4. Now you can launch Emacs and Spacemacs will be loaded.\n\n## Alternative Install Location\n\nTo install Spacemacs in a different location, we first need to introduce how\nSpacemacs is loaded:\n\nWhen Emacs is started, it looks for the init file\n[in a deterministic way][Emacs: Find Init]. The\n[default installation](#default-install) exploits it by occupying\n`$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el` and let Emacs use it as its init file.\n\nIn other word, in default installation, Emacs find and load\n`$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el`, which is then responsible to load other files in\n`$HOME/.emacs.d`.\n\nIf you want to install Spacemacs to a different location, you need to make\nsure it's loaded by Emacs in one of its [init file][Emacs: Find Init].\n\nFor example, if you've cloned Spacemacs to `$HOME/Spacemacs`, and if you use\n`$HOME/.emacs.el` as Emacs init file, then the following lines in\n`$HOME/.emacs.el`:\n\n```elisp\n;; load Spacemacs's initialization file, \"~\" is equivalent to \"$HOME\"\n(load-file \"~/Spacemacs/init.el\")\n```\n\n# First Launch and Configuration\n\n1. After cloning Spacemacs, the first time when you launch Emacs, Spacemacs will\n   automatically install the essential packages it requires. This step is the\n   bootstrap.\n\n2. Once the bootstrap packages are installed, Spacemacs checks whether you have\n   an customization file `$HOME/.spacemacs`, known as `dotspacemacs`:\n\n   - If it already exists, Spacemacs loads it as the configuration.\n   - Otherwise, you need to answer a few questions and Spacemacs will generate\n     the `dotspacemacs` file for you.\n\n   If you are new to Emacs and/or Spacemacs, it's fine to just accept the\n   default choices. They can be changed in the `dotspacemacs` file later.\n\n3. Spacemacs will download and install remaining packages it will require,\n   according to your `dotspacemacs`. When the all the packages have been\n   installed, restart Emacs to complete the installation.\n\n4. `dotspacemacs` is the configuration file for Spacemacs, it's self\n   explanatory and is written in Emacs Lisp. Read\n   [general documentation][DOCUMENTATION.org] and\n   [quick start guide][QUICK_START.org] for more information.\n\n5. In case you want to store your `dotspacemacs` at another location, say\n   under `$HOME/.spacemacs.d`:\n\n   - First set the environment variable `SPACEMACSDIR` to `$HOME/.spacemacs.d`.\n   - Move `$HOME/.spacemacs` to `$HOME/.spacemacs.d/init.el`.\n\n   In other word, set `SPACEMACSDIR` to the parent directory of your\n   `dotspacemacs`, and move `dotspacemacs` to the said directory.\n\n## Spacemacs logo\n\nFor Linux users, create `spacemacs.desktop` in `~/.local/share/applications/`\nusing [this .desktop file][spacemacs-desktop] as a reference. Change the `Name`\nparameter to `Name=Spacemacs` and the `Icon` parameter to\n`Icon=/PATH/TO/EMACSD/core/banners/img/spacemacs.png` where `PATH/TO/EMACSD` is\nthe path to your `.emacs.d` directory, by default `~/.emacs.d`.\n\nFor macOS users, you need to [download the .icns version of the\nlogo][icon-repository] and simply [change the logo on the\nDock][icon-mac-instructions].\n\n## Notes\n\n- Depending on the installed version of GnuTLS, securely installing Emacs\n  packages may fail. If this happens to you please update your OS and Emacs.\n  If you are behind a company proxy please trust the company firewall cert.\n  We do not longer support disabling https due to security reasons.\n\n- (*Windows)* If the following error occurs after starting Emacs:\n\n  ```\n  The directory ~/.emacs.d/server is unsafe\n  ```\n\n  Fix it by changing the owner of the directory `~/.emacs.d/server`:\n    - From Properties select the Tab \u201cSecurity\u201d,\n    - Select the button \u201cAdvanced\u201d,\n    - Select the Tab \u201cOwner\u201d\n    - Change the owner to your account name\n\n  Source: [Stack Overflow][so-server-unsafe]\n\n- (*Windows*) The period (dot) before a file or folder name means that it's a\n  hidden file or folder. To show hidden files and folders:\n  - Press the Windows key\n  - Type `File explorer options`\n  - Select the `View` tab at the top\n  - Check `Show hidden files, folders and drives`\n  - Click `OK`\n\n# Update\n\nSpacemacs relies solely on a rolling update scheme based on the latest\nchanges available. To update Spacemacs, simply pull the latest\nchanges from the `develop` branch:\n\n1. Close Emacs and update the git repository:\n\n    ```sh\n    git pull --rebase\n    ```\n\n2. Restart Emacs to complete the upgrade.\n\n**After updating Spacemacs, you should also\ncheck if any updates are available for your packages. On the Spacemacs Home\nBuffer <kbd>SPC b h</kbd>, click (press <kbd>RET</kbd>) on the `[Update\nPackages]` button, or use the convenient keybinding <kbd>SPC f e U</kbd>**\n\n## Upgrading from the deprecated `master` branch\n\nIf you are still on the old `master` branch (i.e., if\n`git branch --show-current` shows `master` instead of `develop`),\nyou need to [upgrade to `develop`](https://practical.li/spacemacs/reference/switch-to-develop/)\nfirst.\n\n# Quotes\n[Quote][quote01] by [ashnur](https://github.com/ashnur):\n\n    \u00abI feel that spacemacs is an aircraft
