One reason we started this project is that we felt that there weren't enough resources for people creating open-source projects.\n\nOur goal was to aggregate community best practices, *not* what GitHub (or any other individual or entity) thinks is best. Therefore, we used examples and quotations from others to illustrate our points.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Check out our [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways to offer feedback and contribute.\n\n## Licenses\n\nContent is released under [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). See [notices](notices.md) for complete details, including attribution guidelines, contribution terms, and software and third-party licenses and permissions.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe initial release of these guides were authored by **[@nayafia][1], [@bkeepers][2], [@stephbwills][3],** and **[@mlinksva][4]**.\n\nThanks to **[@aitchabee][5], [@benbalter][6], [@brettcannon][7], [@caabernathy][8], [@coralineada][9], [@dmleong][10], [@ericholscher][11], [@gr2m][12], [@janl][13], [@jessfraz][14], [@joshsimmons][15], [@kfogel][16], [@kytrinyx][17], [@lee-dohm][18], [@mikeal][19], [@mikemcquaid][20], [@nathansobo][21], [@nruff][22], [@nsqe][23], [@orta][24], [@parkr][25], [@shazow][26], [@steveklabnik][27],** and **[@wooorm][28]** for lending their valuable input and expertise leading up to the initial release, and to **[@sophshep][29]** and **[@jeejkang][30]** for designing and illustrating the guides.\n\n## Disclaimer\nWhile we've got advice about running an open source project, we're not lawyers.
