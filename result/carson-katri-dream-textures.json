To work around this, run the following command in the app `Terminal`: `xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Blender/3.3/scripts/addons/dream_textures/.python_dependencies`. This will allow the PyTorch `.dylib`s and `.so`s to load without having to manually allow each one in System Preferences.\n\nIf you want a visual guide to installation, see this video tutorial from Ashlee Martino-Tarr: https://youtu.be/kEcr8cNmqZk\n> Ensure you always install the [latest version](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures/releases/latest) of the add-on if any guides become out of date.\n\n# Usage\n\nHere's a few quick guides:\n\n## [Setting Up](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures/wiki/Setup)\nSetup instructions for various platforms and configurations.\n\n## [Image Generation](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures/wiki/Image-Generation)\nCreate textures, concept art, and more with text prompts. Learn how to use the various configuration options to get exactly what you're looking for.\n\n![A graphic showing each step of the image generation process](docs/assets/image_generation.png)\n\n## [Texture Projection](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures/wiki/Texture-Projection)\nTexture entire models and scenes with depth to image.\n\n![A graphic showing each step of the texture projection process](docs/assets/texture_projection.png)\n\n## [Inpaint/Outpaint](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures/wiki/Inpaint-and-Outpaint)\nInpaint to fix up images and convert existing textures into seamless ones automatically.\n\nOutpaint to increase the size of an image by extending it in any direction.\n\n![A graphic showing each step of the outpainting process](docs/assets/inpaint_outpaint.png)\n\n## [Render Engine](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures/wiki/Render-Engine)\nUse the Dream Textures node system to create complex effects.\n\n![A graphic showing each frame of a render, split with the scene and generated result](docs/assets/render_pass.png)\n\n## [AI Upscaling](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures/wiki/AI-Upscaling)\nUpscale your low-res generations 4x.\n\n![A graphic showing each step of the upscaling process](docs/assets/upscale.png)\n\n## [History](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures/wiki/History)\nRecall, export, and import history entries for later use.\n\n# Compatibility\nDream Textures has been tested with CUDA and Apple Silicon GPUs. Over 4GB of VRAM is recommended.\n\nIf you have an issue with a supported GPU, please create an issue.\n\n### Cloud Processing\nIf your hardware is unsupported, you can use DreamStudio to process in the cloud. Follow the instructions in the release notes to setup with DreamStudio.\n\n# Contributing\nFor detailed instructions on installing from source, see the guide on [setting up a development environment](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Development-Environment).\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\nIf you are experiencing trouble getting Dream Textures running, check Blender's system console (in the top left under the \"Window\" dropdown next to \"File\" and \"Edit\") for any error messages. Then [search in the issues list](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures/issues?q=is%3Aissue) with your error message and symptoms.\n\n> **Note** On macOS there is no option to open the system console. Instead, you can get logs by opening the app *Terminal*, entering the command `/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender` and pressing the Enter key. This will launch Blender and any error messages will show up in the Terminal app.\n\n![A screenshot of the \"Window\" > \"Toggle System Console\" menu action in Blender](docs/assets/readme-toggle-console.png)\n\nFeatures and feedback are also accepted on the issues page. If you have any issues that aren't listed, feel free to add them there!\n\nThe [Dream Textures Discord server](https://discord.gg/EmDJ8CaWZ7) also has a common issues list and strong community of helpful people, so feel free to come by for some help there as well.\n\n",
