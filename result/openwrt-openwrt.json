Instead\nof trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully\nwritable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the\napplication selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you\nto customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application.\nFor developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having\nto build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for\nfull customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.\n\nSunshine!\n\n## Download\n\nBuilt firmware images are available for many architectures and come with a\npackage selection to be used as WiFi home router. To quickly find a factory\nimage usable to migrate from a vendor stock firmware to OpenWrt, try the\n*Firmware Selector*.\n\n* [OpenWrt Firmware Selector](https://firmware-selector.openwrt.org/)\n\nIf your device is supported, please follow the **Info** link to see install\ninstructions or consult the support resources listed below.\n\n## \n\nAn advanced user may require additional or specific package. (Toolchain, SDK, ...) For everything else than simple firmware download, try the wiki download page:\n\n* [OpenWrt Wiki Download](https://openwrt.org/downloads)\n\n## Development\n\nTo build your own firmware you need a GNU/Linux, BSD or macOS system (case\nsensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack of a\ncase sensitive file system.\n\n### Requirements\n\nYou need the following tools to compile OpenWrt, the package names vary between\ndistributions. A complete list with distribution specific packages is found in\nthe [Build System Setup](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem)\ndocumentation.\n\n```\nbinutils bzip2 diff find flex gawk gcc-6+ getopt grep install libc-dev libz-dev\nmake4.1+ perl python3.7+ rsync subversion unzip which\n```\n\n### Quickstart\n\n1. Run `./scripts/feeds update -a` to obtain all the latest package definitions\n   defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default\n\n2. Run `./scripts/feeds install -a` to install symlinks for all obtained\n   packages into package/feeds/\n\n3. Run `make menuconfig` to select your preferred configuration for the\n   toolchain, target system & firmware packages.\n\n4. Run `make` to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build the\n   cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the GNU/Linux kernel & all chosen\n   applications for your target system.\n\n### Related Repositories\n\nThe main repository uses multiple sub-repositories to manage packages of\ndifferent categories. All packages are installed via the OpenWrt package\nmanager called `opkg`. If you're looking to develop the web interface or port\npackages to OpenWrt, please find the fitting repository below.\n\n* [LuCI Web Interface](https://github.com/openwrt/luci): Modern and modular\n  interface to control the device via a web browser.\n\n* [OpenWrt Packages](https://github.com/openwrt/packages): Community repository\n  of ported packages.\n\n* [OpenWrt Routing](https://github.com/openwrt/routing): Packages specifically\n  focused on (mesh) routing.\n\n* [OpenWrt Video](https://github.com/openwrt/video): Packages specifically\n  focused on display servers and clients (Xorg and Wayland).\n\n## Support Information\n\nFor a list of supported devices see the [OpenWrt Hardware Database](https://openwrt.org/supported_devices)\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Quick Start Guide](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-quick-start/start)\n* [User Guide](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/start)\n* [Developer Documentation](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/start)\n* [Technical Reference](https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/start)\n\n### Support Community\n\n* [Forum](https://forum.openwrt.org): For usage, projects, discussions and hardware advise.\n* [Support Chat](https://webchat.oftc.net/#openwrt): Channel `#openwrt` on **oftc.net**.\n\n### Developer Community\n\n* [Bug Reports](https://bugs.openwrt.org): Report bugs in OpenWrt\n* [Dev Mailing List](https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel): Send patches\n* [Dev Chat](https://webchat.oftc.net/#openwrt-devel): Channel `#openwrt-devel` on **oftc.net**.\n\n## License\n\nOpenWrt is licensed under GPL-2.0\n",
