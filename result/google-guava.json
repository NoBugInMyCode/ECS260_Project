It\nis widely used on most Java projects within Google, and widely used by many\nother companies as well.\n\n\n\nGuava comes in two flavors:\n\n*   The JRE flavor requires JDK 1.8 or higher.\n*   If you need support for Android, use\n    [the Android flavor](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Android). You can\n    find the Android Guava source in the [`android` directory].\n\n[`android` directory]: https://github.com/google/guava/tree/master/android\n\n## Adding Guava to your build\n\nGuava's Maven group ID is `com.google.guava`, and its artifact ID is `guava`.\nGuava provides two different \"flavors\": one for use on a (Java 8+) JRE and one\nfor use on Android or by any library that wants to be compatible with Android.\nThese flavors are specified in the Maven version field as either `33.4.0-jre` or\n`33.4.0-android`. For more about depending on Guava, see\n[using Guava in your build].\n\nTo add a dependency on Guava using Maven, use the following:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>\n  <artifactId>guava</artifactId>\n  <version>33.4.0-jre</version>\n  <!-- or, for Android: -->\n  <version>33.4.0-android</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nTo add a dependency using Gradle:\n\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n  // Pick one:\n\n  // 1. Use Guava in your implementation only:\n  implementation(\"com.google.guava:guava:33.4.0-jre\")\n\n  // 2. Use Guava types in your public API:\n  api(\"com.google.guava:guava:33.4.0-jre\")\n\n  // 3. Android - Use Guava in your implementation only:\n  implementation(\"com.google.guava:guava:33.4.0-android\")\n\n  // 4. Android - Use Guava types in your public API:\n  api(\"com.google.guava:guava:33.4.0-android\")\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on when to use `api` and when to use `implementation`,\nconsult the\n[Gradle documentation on API and implementation separation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_separation).\n\n## Snapshots and Documentation\n\nSnapshots of Guava built from the `master` branch are available through Maven\nusing version `HEAD-jre-SNAPSHOT`, or `HEAD-android-SNAPSHOT` for the Android\nflavor.\n\n[Snapshot API Javadoc][guava-snapshot-api-docs] as well as\n[Snapshot API Diffs][guava-snapshot-api-diffs] are also available.\n\n## Learn about Guava\n\n-   Our users' guide, [Guava Explained]\n-   [A nice collection](https://www.tfnico.com/presentations/google-guava) of\n    other helpful links\n\n## Links\n\n-   [GitHub project](https://github.com/google/guava)\n-   [Issue tracker: Report a defect or feature request](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/new)\n-   [StackOverflow: Ask \"how-to\" and \"why-didn't-it-work\" questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=guava+java)\n-   [guava-announce: Announcements of releases and upcoming significant changes](https://groups.google.com/group/guava-announce)\n-   [guava-discuss: For open-ended questions and discussion](https://groups.google.com/group/guava-discuss)\n\n## IMPORTANT WARNINGS\n\n1.  APIs marked with the `@Beta` annotation at the class or method level are\n    subject to change. They can be modified in any way, or even removed, at any\n    time. If your code is a library itself (i.e., it is used on the CLASSPATH of\n    users outside your own control), you should not use beta APIs unless you\n    [repackage] them. **If your code is a library, we strongly recommend using\n    the [Guava Beta Checker] to ensure that you do not use any `@Beta` APIs!**\n\n2.  APIs without `@Beta` will remain binary-compatible for the indefinite\n    future. (Previously, we sometimes removed such APIs after a deprecation\n    period. The last release to remove non-`@Beta` APIs was Guava 21.0.) Even\n    `@Deprecated` APIs will remain (again, unless they are `@Beta`). We have no\n    plans to start removing things again, but officially, we're leaving our\n    options open in case of surprises (like, say, a serious security problem).\n\n3.  Guava has one dependency that is needed for linkage at runtime:\n    `com.google.guava:failureaccess:1.0.2`. It also has\n    [some annotation-only dependencies][guava-deps], which we discuss in more\n    detail at that link.\n\n4.  Serialized forms of ALL objects are subject to change unless noted\n    otherwise. Do not persist these and assume they can be read by a future\n    version of the library.\n\n5.  Our classes are not designed to protect against a malicious caller. You\n    should not use them for communication between trusted and untrusted code.\n\n6.  For the mainline flavor, we test the libraries using OpenJDK 8, 11, and 17\n    on Linux, with some additional testing on newer JDKs and on Windows. Some\n    features, especially in `com.google.common.io`, may not work correctly in\n    non-Linux environments. For the Android flavor, our unit tests also run on\n    API level 21 (Lollipop).\n\n[guava-snapshot-api-docs]: https://guava.dev/releases/snapshot-jre/api/docs/\n[guava-snapshot-api-diffs]: https://guava.dev/releases/snapshot-jre/api/diffs/\n[Guava Explained]: https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Home\n[Guava Beta Checker]: https://github.com/google/guava-beta-checker\n\n<!-- References -->\n\n[using Guava in your build]: https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild\n[repackage]: https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-if-i-want-to-use-beta-apis-from-a-library-that-people-use-as-a-dependency\n[guava-deps]: https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\n",
