By using torrent-style DHT, peers can find the IP of other peers by using their Tox ID. Once the IP is obtained, peers can initiate a [secure](/docs/updates/Crypto.md) connection with each other. Once the connection is made, peers can exchange messages, send files, start video chats, etc. using encrypted communications.\n\n\n**Current build status:** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/irungentoo/toxcore.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/irungentoo/toxcore)\n\n\n## Q&A:\n\n### What are your goals with Tox?\n\nWe want Tox to be as simple as possible while remaining as secure as possible.\n\n### Why are you doing this? There are already a bunch of free Skype alternatives.\nThe goal of this project is to create a configuration-free P2P Skype replacement. \u201cConfiguration-free\u201d means that the user will simply have to open the program and will be capable of adding people and communicating with them without having to set up an account. There are many so-called Skype replacements, but all of them are either hard to configure for the normal user or suffer from being way too centralized.\n\n## TODO:\n- [TODO](/docs/TODO.md)\n\n\n## Documentation:\n\n- [Compiling](/INSTALL.md)\n- [DHT Protocol](/docs/updates/DHT.md)<br />\n- [Crypto](/docs/updates/Crypto.md)<br />\n",
