It also provides advanced AI capabilities with multi-LLM support.\n\nBy providing functionality for proxying, routing, load balancing, health checking, authentication (and [more](#features)), Kong serves as the central layer for orchestrating microservices or conventional API traffic with ease.\n\nKong runs natively on Kubernetes thanks to its official [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller).\n\n---\n\n[Installation](https://konghq.com/install/#kong-community) | [Documentation](https://docs.konghq.com) | [Discussions](https://github.com/Kong/kong/discussions) | [Forum](https://discuss.konghq.com) | [Blog](https://konghq.com/blog) | [Builds][kong-master-builds] | [Cloud Hosted Kong](https://konghq.com/kong-konnect/)\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you prefer to use a cloud-hosted Kong, you can [sign up for a free trial of Kong Konnect](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register?utm_medium=Referral&utm_source=Github&utm_campaign=kong-gateway&utm_content=konnect-promo-in-gateway&utm_term=get-started) and get started in minutes. If not, you can follow the instructions below to get started with Kong on your own infrastructure.\n\nLet\u2019s test drive Kong by adding authentication to an API in under 5 minutes.\n\nWe suggest using the docker-compose distribution via the instructions below, but there is also a [docker installation](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/install/docker/#install-kong-gateway-in-db-less-mode) procedure if you\u2019d prefer to run the Kong API Gateway in DB-less mode.\n\nWhether you\u2019re running in the cloud, on bare metal, or using containers, you can find every supported distribution on our [official installation](https://konghq.com/install/#kong-community) page.\n\n1) To start, clone the Docker repository and navigate to the compose folder.\n```cmd\n  $ git clone https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong\n  $ cd docker-kong/compose/\n```\n\n2) Start the Gateway stack using:\n```cmd\n  $ KONG_DATABASE=postgres docker-compose --profile database up\n```\n\nThe Gateway is now available on the following ports on localhost:\n\n- `:8000` - send traffic to your service via Kong\n- `:8001` - configure Kong using Admin API or via [decK](https://github.com/kong/deck)\n- `:8002` - access Kong's management Web UI ([Kong Manager](https://github.com/Kong/kong-manager)) on [localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)\n\nNext, follow the [quick start guide](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/getting-started/configuring-a-service/\n) to tour the Gateway features.\n\n## Features\n\nBy centralizing common API functionality across all your organization's services, the Kong API Gateway creates more freedom for engineering teams to focus on the challenges that matter most.\n\nThe top Kong features include:\n- Advanced routing, load balancing, health checking - all configurable via a RESTful admin API or declarative configuration.\n- Authentication and authorization for APIs using methods like JWT, basic auth, OAuth, ACLs and more.\n- Proxy, SSL/TLS termination, and connectivity support for L4 or L7 traffic.\n- Plugins for enforcing traffic controls, rate limiting, req/res transformations, logging, monitoring and including a plugin developer hub.\n- Plugins for AI traffic to support multi-LLM implementations and no-code AI use cases, with advanced AI prompt engineering, AI observability, AI security and more.\n- Sophisticated deployment models like Declarative Databaseless Deployment and Hybrid Deployment (control plane/data plane separation) without any vendor lock-in.\n- Native [ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller) support for serving Kubernetes.\n\n[![][kong-benefits]][kong-url]\n\n### Plugin Hub\nPlugins provide advanced functionality that extends the use of the Gateway. Many of the Kong Inc. and community-developed plugins like AWS Lambda, Correlation ID, and Response Transformer are showcased at the [Plugin Hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/).\n\nContribute to the Plugin Hub and ensure your next innovative idea is published and available to the broader community!\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe \u2764\ufe0f pull requests, and we\u2019re continually working hard to make it as easy as possible for developers to contribute. Before beginning development with the Kong API Gateway, please familiarize yourself with the following developer resources:\n- Community Pledge ([COMMUNITY_PLEDGE.md](COMMUNITY_PLEDGE.md)) for our pledge to interact with you, the open source community.\n- Contributor Guide ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)) to learn about how to contribute to Kong.\n- Development Guide ([DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md)): Setting up your development environment.\n- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [COPYRIGHT](COPYRIGHT)\n\nUse the [Plugin Development Guide](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/plugin-development/) for building new and creative plugins, or browse the online version of Kong's source code documentation in the [Plugin Development Kit (PDK) Reference](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/pdk/). Developers can build plugins in [Lua](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/plugin-development/), [Go](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/external-plugins/#developing-go-plugins) or [JavaScript](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/external-plugins/#developing-javascript-plugins).\n\n## Releases\n\nPlease see the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more details about a given release. The [SemVer Specification](https://semver.org) is followed when versioning Gateway releases.\n\n## Join the Community\n\n- Check out the [docs](https://docs.konghq.com/)\n- Join the [Kong discussions forum](https://github.com/Kong/kong/discussions)\n- Join the Kong discussions at the Kong Nation forum: [https://discuss.konghq.com/](https://discuss.konghq.com/)\n- Join our [Community Slack](http://kongcommunity.slack.com/)\n- Read up on the latest happenings at our [blog](https://konghq.com/blog/)\n- Follow us on [X](https://x.com/thekonginc)\n- Subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/KongInc/videos)\n- Visit our [homepage](https://konghq.com/) to learn more\n\n## Konnect Cloud\n\nKong Inc. offers commercial subscriptions that enhance the Kong API Gateway in a variety of ways.
