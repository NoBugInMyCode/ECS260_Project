Version 5 will get critical bug fixes only. Version 3 and 4 are\nnow end-of-life and we don't plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x\nor 3.x.\n\nYou can see a complete list of versions on [our Versions\npage](https://fontawesome.com/versions).\n\n## Change log\n\nThe change log for releases is now [available directly on our site](https://fontawesome.com/docs/changelog/).\n\nLooking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).\n\n## Upgrading\n\nFrom time-to-time we'll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.\n\n- [Web upgrading guide](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/upgrade/)\n- [Desktop upgrading guide](https://fontawesome.com/docs/desktop/setup/upgrade/)\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nWe will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our\n[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included\nare directions for opening issues.\n\n## Versioning\n\nFont Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered\nwith the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit https://semver.org.\n\n**The major version \"6\" is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore\nwe deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**\n\n* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing\n  icon\n* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks\n  backward compatibility\n* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will\n  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md\n* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons\n* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward\n  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases\n\n## License\n\nFont Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for\ncommercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.\n\n- Icons \u2014 CC BY 4.0 License\n  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.\n- Fonts \u2014 SIL OFL 1.1 License\n  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.\n- Code \u2014 MIT License\n  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.\n\nAttribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font\nAwesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient\nattribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these\nfiles normally.\n\nWe've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work\nto remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to\nlearn about Font Awesome.\n\n## Team\n\nhttps://github.com/orgs/FortAwesome/people\n",
