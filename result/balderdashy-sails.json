It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app & API development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.\n\nSince version 1.0, Sails supports `await` out of the box.  This replaces nested callbacks (and the commensurate error handling) with simple, familiar usage:\n\n```javascript\nvar orgs = await Organization.find();\n```\n\n\n## Installation &nbsp;\n**With [node](http://nodejs.org) [installed](http://nodejs.org/en/download):**\n```sh\n# Get the latest stable release of Sails\n$ npm install sails -g\n```\n\n> ##### Upgrading from an earlier version of Sails?\n> Upgrade guides for all major releases since 2013 are available on the Sails website under [**Upgrading**](http://sailsjs.com/upgrading).\n\n\n## Your First Sails Project\n\n**Create a new app:**\n```sh\n# Create the app\nsails new my-app\n```\n\n**Lift sails:**\n```sh\n# cd into the new folder\ncd my-app\n\n# fire up the server\nsails lift\n```\n\n[![Screenshot from the original Sails video](http://i.imgur.com/Ii88jlhl.png)](https://sailsjs.com/get-started)\n\nFor the most up-to-date introduction to Sails, [get started here](https://sailsjs.com/get-started).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nSails is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).\n\nSails [actions](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/actions-and-controllers) are compatible with Connect middleware, so in most cases, you can paste code into Sails from an existing Express project and everything will work-- plus you'll be able to use WebSockets to talk to your API, and vice versa.\n\nThe ORM, [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline), has a well-defined adapter system for supporting all kinds of datastores.  Officially supported databases include [MySQL](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-mysql), [PostgreSQL](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-postgresql), [MongoDB](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-mongo), [Redis](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-redis), and [local disk / memory](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-disk).\nCommunity adapters exist for [CouchDB](https://github.com/search?q=sails+couch&nwo=codeswarm%2Fsails-couchdb-orm&search_target=global&ref=cmdform), [neDB](https://github.com/adityamukho/sails-nedb), [SQLite](https://github.com/AndrewJo/sails-sqlite3/tree/0.10), [Oracle](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22sails+oracle%22+OR+%22waterline+oracle%22&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [MSSQL](https://github.com/misterGF/sails-mssqlserver), [DB2](https://github.com/search?q=sails+db2&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/search?q=%28elasticsearch+AND+sails%29+OR+%28elasticsearch+AND+waterline%29+&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [Riak](https://github.com/search?q=sails+riak&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults),\n[neo4j](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sails-neo4j), [OrientDB](https://github.com/appscot/sails-orientdb),\n[Amazon RDS](https://github.com/TakenPilot/sails-rds), [DynamoDB](https://github.com/TakenPilot/sails-dynamodb), [Azure Tables](https://github.com/azuqua/sails-azuretables), [RethinkDB](https://github.com/gutenye/sails-rethinkdb) and [Solr](https://github.com/sajov/sails-solr); for various 3rd-party REST APIs like Quickbooks, Yelp, and Twitter, including a configurable generic [REST API adapter](https://github.com/zohararad/sails-rest); plus some [eclectic projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmcQZD_LIAE).\n\n<!-- Core adapter logos -->\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mysql.com\">\n  <img width=\"75\" src=\"http://www.mysql.com/common/logos/powered-by-mysql-125x64.png\" alt=\"Powered by MySQL\" title=\"sails-mysql: MySQL adapter for Sails\"/>\n</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\"><img width=\"50\" title=\"PostgreSQL\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OSlDDKv.png\"/></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/\"><img width=\"100\" title=\"MongoDB\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bC2j13z.png\"/></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://redis.io/\"><img width=\"75\" title=\"Redis\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dozv0ub.jpg\"/></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<!-- /core adapter logos -->\n\n> For the latest core adapters and notable community adapters, see [Available Adapters](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/adapters/available-adapters).\n\n## Tutorial Course\n- [Sailscasts](https://sailscasts.com/), taught by [Kelvin Omereshone](https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin) _(English)_\n- [Full-Stack JavaScript with Sails.js and Vue.js](https://platzi.com/cursos/javascript-pro/), taught by [Mike McNeil](https://twitter.com/mikermcneil) _(in English, with optional Spanish subtitles)_\n\n\n## Books\n- [Sails.js in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/sails-js-in-action) by Mike McNeil and Irl Nathan (Manning Publications).\n- [Sails.js Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/sailsjs-essentials) by Shaikh Shahid (Packt)\n- [Pro Express.js: Part 3](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4842-0037-7_18) by Azat Mardan (Apress).\n\n## Support\nNeed help or have a question?\n- [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](http://sailsjs.com/faq)\n- [Tutorials](http://sailsjs.com/faq#?what-are-some-good-community-tutorials)\n- [Community support](http://sailsjs.com/support)\n- [Professional/Enterprise options](http://sailsjs.com/faq#?are-there-professional-support-options)\n\n\n## Issue submission\nPlease read the [submission guidelines](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/issue-contributions) and [code of conduct](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct) before opening a new issue.

After building a few applications and taking them into production, we realized that the Node.js development landscape was very much still the Wild West. Over time, after trying lots of different methodologies, we decided to crystallize all of our best practices into this framework.  Six years later, Sails is now one of the most widely-used web application frameworks in the world. I hope it saves you some time! :)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  Copyright \u00a9 2012-present, Mike McNeil\n\n> Sails is built around so many great open-source technologies that it would never have crossed our minds to keep it proprietary.
