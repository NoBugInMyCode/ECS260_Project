We run a hosted version at [www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com), but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of Overleaf.\n\n## Enterprise\n\nIf you want help installing and maintaining Overleaf in your lab or workplace, we offer an officially supported version called [Overleaf Server Pro](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises). It also includes more features for security (SSO with LDAP or SAML), administration and collaboration (e.g. tracked changes). [Find out more!](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises)\n\n## Keeping up to date\n\nSign up to the [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/overleaf.com/community-edition-and-server-pro) to get updates on Overleaf releases and development.\n\n## Installation\n\nWe have detailed installation instructions in the [Overleaf Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/).\n\n## Upgrading\n\nIf you are upgrading from a previous version of Overleaf, please see the [Release Notes section on the Wiki](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki#release-notes) for all of the versions between your current version and the version you are upgrading to.\n\n## Overleaf Docker Image\n\nThis repo contains two dockerfiles, [`Dockerfile-base`](server-ce/Dockerfile-base), which builds the\n`sharelatex/sharelatex-base` image, and [`Dockerfile`](server-ce/Dockerfile) which builds the\n`sharelatex/sharelatex` (or \"community\") image.\n\nThe Base image generally contains the basic dependencies like `wget`, plus `texlive`.\nWe split this out because it's a pretty heavy set of\ndependencies, and it's nice to not have to rebuild all of that every time.\n\nThe `sharelatex/sharelatex` image extends the base image and adds the actual Overleaf code\nand services.\n\nUse `make build-base` and `make build-community` from `server-ce/` to build these images.\n\nWe use the [Phusion base-image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)\n(which is extended by our `base` image) to provide us with a VM-like container\nin which to run the Overleaf services. Baseimage uses the `runit` service\nmanager to manage services, and we add our init-scripts from the `server-ce/runit`\nfolder.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for information on contributing to the development of Overleaf.\n\n## Authors\n\n[The Overleaf Team](https://www.overleaf.com/about)\n\n## License\n\nThe code in this repository is released under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, version 3.
