Fan Control is basically a UI on top of existing hardware libraries. Any issue regarding hardware compatibility entirely depends on the following projects. If you can't contribute meaningfully with a branch/PR, don't pollute their issue page with \"XXXXX doesn't work\". The hardware is needed for testing. If a dev has interest in that project, is browsing it, has your specific hardware AND the knowledge to make it work, that dev won't be looking for your issue, he'll just raise a PR.\n  * https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor\n  * https://github.com/falahati/NvAPIWrapper\n  \n* Please only open issues on this repository for the software itself, UI, feature request and so on. If it's a \"make this work please\" hardware support request, I will link this section of the README and close your issue.\n* If you do have a special hardware compatibility request and you can provide a __working__ sample of code that can be used in .NET, like with a [Plugin](https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.Releases/wiki/Plugins), then feel free to submit that.\n\n## FAQ\n* __Q__: What settings should I set in my BIOS to play along nicely with FanControl?\n<br>__A__: You want to avoid any \"smart\" control from your BIOS. Setting a fixed default speed, like 50%, works great for most people. Also keep an eye if your BIOS has PWM or DC mode on. One could work better for you depending on your setup.\n* __Q__: My Nvidia cards has X fans, but only two cards show up, why?\n<br>__A__: Your card only has 2 channels, more than 1 fan are plugged to the same channel.\n* __Q__: My Nvidia cards won't go below 30% and doesn't go to 0 RPM, why?\n<br>__A__: [See here](https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.Releases/wiki/Nvidia-30%25-and-0-RPM)\n* __Q__: There is no control cards / control cards are missing / control cards are not changing my fan speeds, what's the issue?\n<br>__A__: See __[ Issues and hardware compatibility](#issues-and-hardware-compatibility)__.\n* __Q__: How does __[FAN CURVE TYPE]__ works and what does its parameters do?\n<br>__A__: Click on its card's icon at the top left, a dialog will tell you.\n* __Q__: Does it run on my OS?\n<br>__A__: If your OS is Windows 10 __Or 11__, yes.\n\n## Libraries used:\n* https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor (main sensor source)\n* https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit (UI)\n* https://github.com/falahati/NvAPIWrapper (Nvidia gpu fan control and sensor reading)\n* https://github.com/Rem0o/ADLXWrapper (AMD gpu fan control and sensor reading)\n* https://github.com/punker76/gong-wpf-dragdrop (various drag and drop actions)\n\n## GitHub Sponsors \nThe GitHub Sponsor button on this page is intended for the related open-source work surrounding FanControl. This includes contributions to the open-source libraries used, mainly [LHM](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor), the plugin system and the various open-source plugins I contribute to, the AMD gpu driver support through [ADLXWrapper](https://github.com/Rem0o/ADLXWrapper), and more.  Your sponsorship helps me continue to contribute to the community, maintain existing projects, and develop new ones. It does not apply to the main program (FanControl) itself. Use the [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_donations&business=N4JPSTUQHRJM8&currency_code=USD&source=url&item_name=Fan+Control) donation button if your intent is to support the FanControl software itself. \n",
