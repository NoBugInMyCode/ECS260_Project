Package your code or an existing binary in an OCI-compatible image to get a highly scalable endpoint with auto-scaling and metrics.\n\n[![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/fold_left.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40openfaas)](https://twitter.com/openfaas)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Ease of use through UI portal and *one-click* install\n* Write services and functions in any language with [Template Store](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/template-store/) or a Dockerfile\n* Build and ship your code in an OCI-compatible/Docker image\n* Portable: runs on existing hardware or public/private cloud by leveraging [Kubernetes](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes)\n* [CLI](http://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli) available with YAML format for templating and defining functions\n* Auto-scales as demand increases [including to zero](https://docs.openfaas.com/architecture/autoscaling/)\n* [Commercially supported Pro distribution by the team behind OpenFaaS](https://openfaas.com/pricing/)\n\n**Want to dig deeper into OpenFaaS?**\n\n* Trigger endpoints with either [HTTP or events sources such as Apache Kafka and AWS SQS](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/triggers/)\n* Offload tasks to the built-in [queuing and background processing](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/async/)\n* Quick-start your Kubernetes journey with [GitOps from OpenFaaS Cloud](https://docs.openfaas.com/openfaas-cloud/intro/)\n* Go secure or go home [with 5 must-know security tips](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/five-security-tips/)\n* Learn everything you need to know to [go to production](https://docs.openfaas.com/architecture/production/)\n* Integrate with Istio or Linkerd with [Featured Tutorials](https://docs.openfaas.com/tutorials/featured/#service-mesh)\n* Deploy to [Kubernetes or OpenShift](https://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/)\n\n## Overview of OpenFaaS (Serverless Functions Made Simple)\n\n![Conceptual architecture](/docs/of-layer-overview.png)\n\n> Conceptual architecture and stack, [more detail available in the docs](https://docs.openfaas.com/architecture/stack/)\n\n### Code samples\n\nYou can generate new functions using the `faas-cli` and built-in templates or use any binary for Windows or Linux in a container.\n\nOfficial templates exist for many popular languages and are easily extensible with Dockerfiles.\n\n* Node.js (`node12`) example:\n\n    ```js\n   \"use strict\"\n\n    module.exports = async (event, context) => {\n        return context\n            .status(200)\n            .headers({\"Content-Type\": \"text/html\"})\n            .succeed(`\n            <h1>\n                \ud83d\udc4b Hello World \ud83c\udf0d\n            </h1>`);\n    }\n\n    ```\n    *handler.js*\n\n* Python 3 example:\n\n    ```python\n    import requests\n\n    def handle(req):\n        r =  requests.get(req, timeout = 1)\n        return \"{} => {:d}\".format(req, r.status_code)\n    ```\n    *handler.py*\n\n* Golang example (`golang-http`)\n\n    ```golang\n    package function\n\n    import (\n        \"fmt\"\n        \"net/http\"\n\n        handler \"github.com/openfaas/templates-sdk/go-http\"\n    )\n\n    // Handle a function invocation\n    func Handle(req handler.Request) (handler.Response, error) {\n        var err error\n\n        message := fmt.Sprintf(\"Body: %s\", string(req.Body))\n\n        return handler.Response{\n            Body:       []byte(message),\n            StatusCode: http.StatusOK,\n        }, err\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Get started with OpenFaaS\n\n### Official training resources\n\nView our [official training materials](https://docs.openfaas.com/tutorials/training)\n\n### Official eBook and video workshop\n[![eBook logo](https://www.alexellis.io/serverless.png)](https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else)\n\nThe founder of OpenFaaS wrote *Serverless For Everyone Else* to help developers understand the use-case for functions through practical hands-on exercises using JavaScript and Node.js. No programming experience is required to try the exercises.\n\nThe examples use the faasd project, which is an easy to use and lightweight way to start learning about OpenFaaS and functions.\n\n[Check out Serverless For Everyone Else on Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else)\n\n### OpenFaaS and Golang\n\nEveryday Go is a practical, hands-on guide to writing CLIs, web pages, and microservices in Go. It also features a chapter dedicated to development and testing of functions using OpenFaaS and Go.\n\n* [Everyday Golang](https://openfaas.gumroad.com/l/everyday-golang)\n\n### Community blog and documentation\n\n* Read the documentation: [docs.openfaas.com](https://docs.openfaas.com/deployment)\n* Read latest news and tutorials on the [Official Blog](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/)\n\n## Community Sponsorship\n\nOpenFaaS users can subscribe to a weekly Community Newsletter called Insiders Updates, to keep up to date with new features, bug fixes, events, tutorials and security patches. Insiders Updates are written by the project founder and distributed via GitHub Sponsors.\n\n* [Get a Community Subscription](https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas/)\n\n### Quickstart\n\n![OpenFaaS Community Edition UI](/docs/inception.png)\n\n> Here is a screenshot of the OpenFaaS Community Edition UI which was designed for ease of use.
