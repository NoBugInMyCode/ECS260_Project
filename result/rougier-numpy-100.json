I've also created some problems myself to reach the 100 limit. The goal of this collection is to offer a quick reference for both old and new users but also to provide a set of exercises for those who teach. For extended exercises, make sure to read [From Python to NumPy](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/).\n\n\u2192 [Test them on Binder](http://mybinder.org:/repo/rougier/numpy-100/notebooks/100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb)  \n\u2192 [Read them on GitHub](100_Numpy_exercises.md)  \n\nNote: markdown and ipython notebook are created programmatically from the source data in `source/exercises.ktx`.\nTo modify the content of these files, please change the text in the source and run the `generators.py` module with a python\ninterpreter with the libraries under `requirements.txt` installed.\n\nThe keyed text format (`ktx`) is a minimal human readable key-values to store text (markdown or others) indexed by keys. \n\nThis work is licensed under the MIT license.  \n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/10173/rougier/numpy-100.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/10173/rougier/numpy-100)\n\n\n### Variants in Other Languages\n\n - **Julia**: [100 Julia Exercises](https://github.com/RoyiAvital/Julia100Exercises).\n",
