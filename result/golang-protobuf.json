Bug reports should ideally be accompanied by a minimal reproduction of\nthe issue. Irreproducible bugs are difficult to diagnose and fix (and likely to\nbe closed after some period of time). Bug reports must specify the version of\nthe\n[Go protocol buffer module](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/releases)\nand also the version of the\n[protocol buffer toolchain](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)\nbeing used.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project is open-source and accepts contributions. See the\n[contribution guide](https://github.com/golang/protobuf/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor more information.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis module and the generated code are expected to be stable over time. However,\nwe reserve the right to make breaking changes without notice for the following\nreasons:\n\n*   **Security:** A security issue in the specification or implementation may\n    come to light whose resolution requires breaking compatibility. We reserve\n    the right to address such issues.\n*   **Unspecified behavior:** There are some aspects of the protocol buffer\n    specification that are undefined. Programs that depend on unspecified\n    behavior may break in future releases.\n*   **Specification changes:** It may become necessary to address an\n    inconsistency, incompleteness, or change in the protocol buffer\n    specification, which may affect the behavior of existing programs. We\n    reserve the right to address such changes.\n*   **Bugs:** If a package has a bug that violates correctness, a program\n    depending on the buggy behavior may break if the bug is fixed. We reserve\n    the right to fix such bugs.\n*   **Generated additions**: We reserve the right to add new declarations to\n    generated Go packages of `.proto` files. This includes declared constants,\n    variables, functions, types, fields in structs, and methods on types. This\n    may break attempts at injecting additional code on top of what is generated\n    by `protoc-gen-go`. Such practice is not supported by this project.\n*   **Internal changes**: We reserve the right to add, modify, and remove\n    internal code, which includes all unexported declarations, the\n    [`generator`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go/generator)\n    package, and all packages under\n    [`internal`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang/protobuf/internal).\n\nAny breaking changes outside of these will be announced 6 months in advance to\n[protobuf@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/protobuf).\n",
