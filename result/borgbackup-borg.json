If Borg is\n    installed on the remote host, big performance gains can be achieved\n    compared to using a network filesystem (sshfs, nfs, ...).\n\n**Backups mountable as filesystems**\n    Backup archives are mountable as userspace filesystems for easy interactive\n    backup examination and restores (e.g. by using a regular file manager).\n\n**Easy installation on multiple platforms**\n    We offer single-file binaries that do not require installing anything -\n    you can just run them on these platforms:\n\n    * Linux\n    * macOS\n    * FreeBSD\n    * OpenBSD and NetBSD (no xattrs/ACLs support or binaries yet)\n    * Cygwin (experimental, no binaries yet)\n    * Linux Subsystem of Windows 10 (experimental)\n\n**Free and Open Source Software**\n  * security and functionality can be audited independently\n  * licensed under the BSD (3-clause) license, see `License`_ for the\n    complete license\n\nEasy to use\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor ease of use, set the BORG_REPO environment variable::\n\n    $ export BORG_REPO=/path/to/repo\n\nCreate a new backup repository (see ``borg repo-create --help`` for encryption options)::\n\n    $ borg repo-create -e repokey-aes-ocb\n\nCreate a new backup archive::\n\n    $ borg create Monday1 ~/Documents\n\nNow doing another backup, just to show off the great deduplication::\n\n    $ borg create -v --stats Monday2 ~/Documents\n    Repository: /path/to/repo\n    Archive name: Monday2\n    Archive fingerprint: 7714aef97c1a24539cc3dc73f79b060f14af04e2541da33d54c7ee8e81a00089\n    Time (start): Mon, 2022-10-03 19:57:35 +0200\n    Time (end):   Mon, 2022-10-03 19:57:35 +0200\n    Duration: 0.01 seconds\n    Number of files: 24\n    Original size: 29.73 MB\n    Deduplicated size: 520 B\n\n\nHelping, Donations and Bounties, becoming a Patron\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nYour help is always welcome!\n\nSpread the word, give feedback, help with documentation, testing or development.\n\nYou can also give monetary support to the project, see there for details:\n\nhttps://www.borgbackup.org/support/fund.html\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n* `Main Web Site <https://borgbackup.readthedocs.org/>`_\n* `Releases <https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases>`_,\n  `PyPI packages <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/borgbackup>`_ and\n  `ChangeLog <https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/blob/master/docs/changes.rst>`_\n* `Offline Documentation <https://readthedocs.org/projects/borgbackup/downloads>`_\n* `GitHub <https://github.com/borgbackup/borg>`_ and\n  `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues>`_.\n* `Web-Chat (IRC) <https://web.libera.chat/#borgbackup>`_ and\n  `Mailing List <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/borgbackup>`_\n* `License <https://borgbackup.readthedocs.org/en/stable/authors.html#license>`_\n* `Security contact <https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support.html#security-contact>`_\n\nCompatibility notes\n-------------------\n\nEXPECT THAT WE WILL BREAK COMPATIBILITY REPEATEDLY WHEN MAJOR RELEASE NUMBER\nCHANGES (like when going from 0.x.y to 1.0.0 or from 1.x.y to 2.0.0).\n\nNOT RELEASED DEVELOPMENT VERSIONS HAVE UNKNOWN COMPATIBILITY PROPERTIES.\n\nTHIS IS SOFTWARE IN DEVELOPMENT, DECIDE YOURSELF WHETHER IT FITS YOUR NEEDS.\n\nSecurity issues should be reported to the `Security contact`_ (or\nsee ``docs/support.rst`` in the source distribution).\n\n.. start-badges\n\n|doc| |build| |coverage| |bestpractices|\n\n.. |doc| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/borgbackup/badge/?version=stable\n        :alt: Documentation\n        :target: https://borgbackup.readthedocs.org/en/stable/\n\n.. |build| image:: https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master\n        :alt: Build Status (master)\n        :target: https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/actions\n\n.. |coverage| image:: https://codecov.io/github/borgbackup/borg/coverage.svg?branch=master\n        :alt: Test Coverage\n        :target: https://codecov.io/github/borgbackup/borg?branch=master\n\n.. |screencast_basic| image:: https://asciinema.org/a/133292.png\n        :alt: BorgBackup Basic Usage\n        :target: https://asciinema.org/a/133292?autoplay=1&speed=1\n        :width: 100%\n\n.. _installation: https://asciinema.org/a/133291?autoplay=1&speed=1\n\n.. _advanced usage: https://asciinema.org/a/133293?autoplay=1&speed=1\n\n.. |bestpractices| image:: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/271/badge\n        :alt: Best Practices Score\n        :target: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/271\n\n.. end-badges\n",
