It organizes data as an ordered key-value store and employs ACID transactions for all operations. It is especially well-suited for read/write workloads but also has excellent performance for write-intensive workloads. Users interact with the database using API language binding.\n\nTo learn more about FoundationDB, visit [foundationdb.org](https://www.foundationdb.org/)\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation can be found online at <https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/>. The documentation covers details of API usage, background information on design philosophy, and extensive usage examples. Docs are built from the [source in this repo](documentation/sphinx/source).\n\n## Forums\n\n[The FoundationDB Forums](https://forums.foundationdb.org/) are the home for most of the discussion and communication about the FoundationDB project. We welcome your participation!  We want FoundationDB to be a great project to be a part of and, as part of that, have established a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to establish what constitutes permissible modes of interaction.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributing to FoundationDB can be in contributions to the code base, sharing your experience and insights in the community on the Forums, or contributing to projects that make use of FoundationDB. Please see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more specifics.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Latest Stable Releases\n\nThe lastest stable releases are (were) versions that are recommended for production use, which have been extensively validated via simulation and real cluster tests and used in our production environment.\n\n| Branch   |     Latest Production Release      |  Notes |\n|:--------:|:-------------:|------:|\n| 7.3      |  [7.3.43](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/tag/7.3.43) | Supported |\n| 7.2      |   | Experimental |\n| 7.1      |  [7.1.57](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/tag/7.1.57)   |   Bug fixes |\n| 7.0      |           |   Experimental |\n| 6.3      |  [6.3.25](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/tag/6.3.25) |   Unsupported |\n\n- `Supported` branches are those we actively maintain and will publish new patch releases.\n- `Bug fixes` are branches we still accept bug fixes into the branch, but may not publish newer patch releases. The community can build the latest release binaries if needed and is encouraged to upgrade to the `Supported` branches.\n- `Experimental` branches are those used for internal feature testing. They are not recommended for production use.\n- `Unsupported` branches are those which will no longer receive any updates.\n\nIf you are running on old production releases, we recommend always upgrading to the next major release's latest version, and then continue to the next major version, e.g., 6.2.X -> 6.3.25 -> 7.1.57 -> 7.3.43. These upgrade paths have been well tested in production (skipping a major release, not marked as `Experimental`, for an upgrade is only tested in simulation).\n\n### Binary downloads\n\nDevelopers interested in using FoundationDB can get started by downloading and installing a binary package. Please see the [downloads page](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases) for a list of available packages.\n\n\n### Compiling from source\n\nDevelopers on an OS for which there is no binary package, or who would like\nto start hacking on the code, can get started by compiling from source.\n\nThe official docker image for building is [`foundationdb/build`](https://hub.docker.com/r/foundationdb/build), which has all dependencies installed. The Docker image definitions used by FoundationDB team members can be found in the [dedicated repository](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-build-support).\n\nTo build outside of the official docker image, you'll need at least these dependencies:\n\n1. Install cmake Version 3.13 or higher [CMake](https://cmake.org/)\n1. Install [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)\n1. Install [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (optional, but recommended)\n\nIf compiling for local development, please set `-DUSE_WERROR=ON` in\ncmake. Our CI compiles with `-Werror` on, so this way you'll find out about\ncompiler warnings that break the build earlier.\n\nOnce you have your dependencies, you can run cmake and then build:\n\n1. Check out this repository.\n1. Create a build directory (you can have the build directory anywhere you\n   like).\n1. `cd <PATH_TO_BUILD_DIRECTORY>`\n1. `cmake -G Ninja <PATH_TO_FOUNDATIONDB_DIRECTORY>`\n1. `ninja # If this crashes it probably ran out of memory. Try ninja -j1`\n\n### Language Bindings\n\nThe language bindings that are supported by cmake will have a corresponding\n`README.md` file in the corresponding `bindings/lang` directory.\n\nGenerally, cmake will build all language bindings for which it can find all\nnecessary dependencies. After each successful cmake run, cmake will tell you\nwhich language bindings it is going to build.\n\n\n### Generating `compile_commands.json`\n\nCMake can build a compilation database for you. However, the default generated\none is not too useful as it operates on the generated files. When running make,\nthe build system will create another `compile_commands.json` file in the source\ndirectory. This can than be used for tools like\n[CCLS](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls),\n[CQuery](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery), etc. This way you can get\ncode-completion and code navigation in flow. It is not yet perfect (it will show\na few errors) but we are constantly working on improving the development experience.\n\nCMake will not produce a `compile_commands.json`, you must pass\n`-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`.  This also enables the target\n`processed_compile_commands`, which rewrites `compile_commands.json` to\ndescribe the actor compiler source file, not the post-processed output files,\nand places the output file in the source directory.  This file should then be\npicked up automatically by any tooling.\n\nNote that if building inside of the `foundationdb/build` docker\nimage, the resulting paths will still be incorrect and require manual fixing.\nOne will wish to re-run `cmake` with `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=OFF` to\nprevent it from reverting the manual changes.\n\n### Using IDEs\n\nCMake has built in support for a number of popular IDEs. However, because flow\nfiles are precompiled with the actor compiler, an IDE will not be very useful as\na user will only be presented with the generated code - which is not what she\nwants to edit and get IDE features for.\n\nThe good news is, that it is possible to generate project files for editing\nflow with a supported IDE. There is a CMake option called `OPEN_FOR_IDE` which\nwill generate a project which can be opened in an IDE for editing. You won't be\nable to build this project, but you will be able to edit the files and get most\nedit and navigation features your IDE supports.\n\nFor example, if you want to use Xcode to make changes to FoundationDB you can\ncreate an Xcode project with the following command:\n\n```sh\ncmake -G Xcode -DOPEN_FOR_IDE=ON <FDB_SOURCE_DIRECTORY>\n```\n\nYou should create a second build-directory which you will use for building and debugging.\n\n#### FreeBSD\n\n1. Check out this repo on your server.\n1. Install compile-time dependencies from ports.\n1. (Optional) Use tmpfs & ccache for significantly faster repeat builds\n1. (Optional) Install a [JDK](https://www.freshports.org/java/openjdk8/)\n   for Java Bindings. FoundationDB currently builds with Java 8.\n1. Navigate to the directory where you checked out the foundationdb\n   repo.\n1. Build from source.\n\n    ```shell\n    sudo pkg install -r FreeBSD \\\n        shells/bash devel/cmake devel/ninja devel/ccache  \\\n        lang/mono lang/python3 \\\n        devel/boost-libs devel/libeio \\\n        security/openssl\n    mkdir .build && cd .build\n    cmake -G Ninja \\\n        -DUSE_CCACHE=on \\\n        -DUSE_DTRACE=off \\\n        ..\n    ninja -j 10\n    # run fast tests\n    ctest -L fast\n    # run all tests\n    ctest --output-on-failure -v\n    ```\n\n\n### Linux\n\nThere are no special requirements for Linux.  A docker image can be pulled from\n`foundationdb/build` that has all of FoundationDB's dependencies\npre-installed, and is what the CI uses to build and test PRs.\n\n```sh\ncmake -G Ninja <FDB_SOURCE_DIR>\nninja\ncpack -G DEB\n```\n\nFor RPM simply replace `DEB` with `RPM`.\n\n### MacOS\n\nThe build under MacOS will work the same way as on Linux. To get boost and ninja you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).\n\n```sh\ncmake -G Ninja <PATH_TO_FOUNDATIONDB_SOURCE>\n```\n\nTo generate a installable package,\n\n```sh\nninja\n$SRCDIR/packaging/osx/buildpkg.sh . $SRCDIR\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nUnder Windows, only Visual Studio with ClangCl is supported\n\n1. Install Visual Studio 2019 (IDE or Build Tools), and enable llvm support\n1. Install  [CMake 3.15](https://cmake.org/) or higher\n1. Download [Boost 1.77.0](https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.77.0/source/boost_1_77_0.7z)\n1. Unpack boost to C:\\boost, or use `-DBOOST_ROOT=<PATH_TO_BOOST>` with `cmake` if unpacked elsewhere\n1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if is not already installed by Visual Studio\n1. (Optional) Install [OpenJDK 11](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download) to build Java bindings\n1. (Optional) Install [OpenSSL 3.x](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) to build with TLS support\n1. (Optional) Install [WIX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) to build Windows installer\n1. `mkdir build && cd build`\n1. `cmake -G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\" -A x64 -T ClangCl <PATH_TO_FOUNDATIONDB_SOURCE>`\n1. `msbuild /p:Configuration=Release foundationdb.sln`\n1. To increase build performance, use `/p:UseMultiToolTask=true` and `/p:CL_MPCount=<NUMBER_OF_PARALLEL_JOBS>` \n",
