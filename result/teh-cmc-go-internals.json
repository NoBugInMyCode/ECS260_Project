        "readme": "# `go-internals`\n\n`go-internals` is a work-in-progress book about the internals of the Go (1.10+) programming language.\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Chapter I: A Primer on Go Assembly](./chapter1_assembly_primer/README.md)\n- [Chapter II: Interfaces](./chapter2_interfaces/README.md)\n- [Chapter III (soon!): The Garbage Collector](./chapter3_garbage_collector/README.md)\n\n---\n\n*Click [here](https://cmc.gitbook.io/go-internals/) for the GitBook version.*\n\n## Goals\n\n- **Concise**: The book aims to be as concise as possible, encouraging code and diagrams over lengthy prose.\n- **Community-effort**: I myself am learning as I go through the writing of this book. I *will* make mistakes along the way. Hopefully the community can help in pointing out and correcting these mistakes.\n- **Beyond the theory**: The book will not just cover the theory, but the actual implementation too. Assumptions will be proven or invalidated via experiments and measurements.\n- **Up-to-Date**: The book will try to keep up-to-date with new Go versions being released.\n- **Experienced audience**: The Go community has created *loads* of great introductory material for newcomers. Unfortunately we're still lacking good resources when it comes to the more advanced stuff. This books hopes to help solve this issue.\n\n## Translations\n\n- [Chinese](https://github.com/go-internals-cn/go-internals)\n\n## Contributing\n\nAll kinds of contributions are very much welcome.\n\nDon't hesitate to open an issue for e.g...:\n- pointing out technical or english mistakes\n- suggesting improvements and/or additions to existing chapters\n- suggesting external links that might be of interest\n- ..and pretty much anything else you can think of, really!\n\n## Author\n\nClement Rey <<cr.rey.clement@gmail.com>> ([@teh_cmc](https://twitter.com/teh_cmc))\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the [BY-NC-SA Creative Commons 4.0 International Public License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n",
