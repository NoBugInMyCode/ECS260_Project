When we do you will start to get console warnings in your build tools.\n- \ud83d\udd12 On Apr 30, 2025 (six months from posting) we will [archiving](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) the `react-beautiful-dnd` Github repository (it will become read only).\n\nThank you everybody for your support of this project.\n\n[More information](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues/2672)\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2182637/53611918-54c1ff80-3c24-11e9-9917-66ac3cef513d.png\" alt=\"react beautiful dnd logo\" />\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">react-beautiful-dnd <small><sup>(rbd)</sup></small></h1>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n**Beautiful** and **accessible** drag and drop for lists with [`React`](https://facebook.github.io/react/)\n\n[![CircleCI branch](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/tree/master)\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-beautiful-dnd.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd)\n\n![quote application example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2182637/53614150-efbed780-3c2c-11e9-9204-a5d2e746faca.gif)\n\n[Play with this example if you want!](https://react-beautiful-dnd.netlify.app/iframe.html?selectedKind=board&selectedStory=simple)\n\n</div>\n\n## Core characteristics\n\n- Beautiful and [natural movement](/docs/about/animations.md) of items \ud83d\udc90\n- [Accessible](/docs/about/accessibility.md): powerful keyboard and screen reader support \u267f\ufe0f\n- [Extremely performant](/docs/support/media.md) \ud83d\ude80\n- Clean and powerful api which is simple to get started with\n- Plays extremely well with standard browser interactions\n- [Unopinionated styling](/docs/guides/preset-styles.md)\n- No creation of additional wrapper dom nodes - flexbox and focus management friendly!\n\n## Get started \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfeb\n\nWe have created [a free course on `egghead.io` \ud83e\udd5a](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd) to help you get started with `react-beautiful-dnd` as quickly as possible.\n\n[![course-logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2182637/43372837-8c72d3f8-93e8-11e8-9d92-a82adde7718f.png)](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd)\n\n## Currently supported feature set \u2705\n\n- Vertical lists \u2195\n- Horizontal lists \u2194\n- Movement between lists (\u25a4 \u2194 \u25a4)\n- [Virtual list support \ud83d\udc7e](/docs/patterns/virtual-lists.md) - unlocking 10,000 items @ 60fps\n- [Combining items](/docs/guides/combining.md)\n- Mouse \ud83d\udc2d, keyboard \ud83c\udfb9\u267f\ufe0f and touch \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udcf1 (mobile, tablet and so on) support\n- [Multi drag support](/docs/patterns/multi-drag.md)\n- Incredible screen reader support \u267f\ufe0f - we provide an amazing experience for english screen readers out of the box \ud83d\udce6. We also provide complete customisation control and internationalisation support for those who need it \ud83d\udc96\n- [Conditional dragging](/docs/api/draggable.md#optional-props) and [conditional dropping](/docs/api/droppable.md#conditionally-dropping)\n- Multiple independent lists on the one page\n- Flexible item sizes - the draggable items can have different heights (vertical lists) or widths (horizontal lists)\n- [Add and remove items during a drag](/docs/guides/changes-while-dragging.md)\n- Compatible with semantic `<table>` reordering - [table pattern](/docs/patterns/tables.md)\n- [Auto scrolling](/docs/guides/auto-scrolling.md) - automatically scroll containers and the window as required during a drag (even with keyboard \ud83d\udd25)\n- Custom drag handles - you can drag a whole item by just a part of it\n- Able to move the dragging item to another element while dragging (clone, portal) - [Reparenting your `<Draggable />`](/docs/guides/reparenting.md)\n- [Create scripted drag and drop experiences \ud83c\udfae](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md)\n- Allows extensions to support for [any input type you like \ud83d\udd79](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md)\n- \ud83c\udf32 Tree support through the [`@atlaskit/tree`](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/confluence/tree) package\n- A `<Droppable />` list can be a scroll container (without a scrollable parent) or be the child of a scroll container (that also does not have a scrollable parent)\n- Independent nested lists - a list can be a child of another list, but you cannot drag items from the parent list into a child list\n- Server side rendering (SSR) compatible - see [resetServerContext()](/docs/api/reset-server-context.md)\n- Plays well with [nested interactive elements](/docs/api/draggable.md#interactive-child-elements-within-a-draggable-) by default\n\n## Motivation \ud83e\udd14\n\n`react-beautiful-dnd` exists to create beautiful drag and drop for lists that anyone can use - even people who cannot see. For a good overview of the history and motivations of the project you can take a look at these external resources:\n\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [Rethinking drag and drop](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/rethinking-drag-and-drop-d9f5770b4e6b)\n- \ud83c\udfa7 [React podcast: fast, accessible and beautiful drag and drop](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/17)\n\n## Not for everyone \u270c\ufe0f\n\nThere are a lot of libraries out there that allow for drag and drop interactions within React. Most notable of these is the amazing [`react-dnd`](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd). It does an incredible job at providing a great set of drag and drop primitives which work especially well with the [wildly inconsistent](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html) html5 drag and drop feature. `react-beautiful-dnd` is a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists (vertical, horizontal, movement between lists, nested lists and so on). Within that subset of functionality `react-beautiful-dnd` offers a powerful, natural and beautiful drag and drop experience. However, it does not provide the breadth of functionality offered by `react-dnd`. So `react-beautiful-dnd` might not be for you depending on what your use case is.\n\n## Documentation \ud83d\udcd6\n\n### About \ud83d\udc4b\n\n- [Installation](/docs/about/installation.md)\n- [Examples and samples](/docs/about/examples.md)\n- [Get started](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd)\n- [Design principles](/docs/about/design-principles.md)\n- [Animations](/docs/about/animations.md)\n- [Accessibility](/docs/about/accessibility.md)\n- [Browser support](/docs/about/browser-support.md)\n\n### Sensors \ud83d\udd09\n\n> The ways in which somebody can start and control a drag\n\n- [Mouse dragging \ud83d\udc2d](/docs/sensors/mouse.md)\n- [Touch dragging \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udcf1](/docs/sensors/touch.md)\n- [Keyboard dragging \ud83c\udfb9\u267f\ufe0f](/docs/sensors/keyboard.md)\n- [Create your own sensor](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md) (allows for any input type as well as scripted experiences)\n\n### API \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\n\n![diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2182637/53607406-c8f3a780-3c12-11e9-979c-7f3b5bd1bfbd.gif)\n\n- [`<DragDropContext />`](/docs/api/drag-drop-context.md) - _Wraps the part of your application you want to have drag and drop enabled for_\n- [`<Droppable />`](/docs/api/droppable.md) - _An area that can be dropped into.
