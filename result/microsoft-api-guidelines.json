If so, you are in the right place!\nWe publish these guidelines here with the aim of fostering dialogue and learning in the API community at large. We further hope that these guidelines might encourage other organizations to create guidelines that are appropriate for them and in turn, if they're able, to publish theirs.\n\n### Guidance for Azure service teams\nAzure service teams should reference the companion documents, [Azure REST API Guidelines](./azure/Guidelines.md) and [Considerations for Service Design](./azure/ConsiderationsForServiceDesign.md), when building or modifying their services. These documents provide a refined set of guidance targeted specifically for Azure services. For more information, please refer to the [README](./azure/README.md) in the Azure folder.\n\n### Guidance for Microsoft Graph service teams\nGraph service teams should reference the companion document, [Microsoft Graph REST API Guidelines](./graph/GuidelinesGraph.md) when building or modifying their services. This document and the associated pattern catalog provide a refined set of guidance targeted specifically for Microsoft Graph services.\n\n[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\n## Code of Conduct\nThis project adopts the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
