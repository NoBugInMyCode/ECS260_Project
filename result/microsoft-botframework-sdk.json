Developers can register and connect their bots to users on Skype, Microsoft Teams, Cortana, Web Chat, and more. [[Docs][28]]\n\n* **Direct Line JS Client**: If you want to use the Direct Line channel in Azure Bot Service and are not using the WebChat client, the Direct Line JS client can be used in your custom application. [[Readme][30]]\n\n<a name=\"ABS-whats-new\"></a>\n\n* **Direct Line Speech Channel**: We are bringing together the Bot Framework and Microsoft's Speech Services to provide a channel that enables streamed speech and text bi-directionally from the client to the bot application.  To sign up, add the 'Direct Line Speech' channel to your Azure Bot Service.\n\n[27]:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/\n[28]:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0\n[29]:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-channels?view=azure-bot-service-4.0\n[30]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-DirectLineJS/blob/main/README.md\n\n* **Better isolation for your Bot - Direct Line App Service Extension** : The Direct Line App Service Extension can be deployed as part of a VNET, allowing IT administrators to have more control over conversation traffic and improved latency in conversations due to reduction in the number of hops. Get started with Direct Line App Service Extension here. A VNET lets you create your own private space in Azure and is crucial to your cloud network as it offers isolation, segmentation, and other key benefits.\n\n### Bot Framework Emulator\nThe [Bot Framework Emulator][60] is a  cross-platform desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug bots built using the Bot Framework SDK. You can use the Bot Framework Emulator to test bots running locally on your machine or to connect to bots running remotely. [[Download latest][61] | [Docs][62]]\n\n[60]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator#readme\n[61]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases/latest\n[62]:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-debug-emulator?view=azure-bot-service-4.0\n\n### Bot Framework Web Chat\nThe Bot Framework [Web Chat][23] is a highly customizable web-based client chat control for Azure Bot Service that provides the ability for users to interact with your bot directly in a web page. [[Stable release][24] | [Docs][25]  | [Samples][26]]\n\n[23]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat#readme\n[24]:https://www.npmjs.com/package/botframework-webchat\n[25]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/docs\n[26]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/samples\n\n### Bot Framework CLI\nThe Bot Framework CLI Tools hosts the [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli) cross-platform Bot Framework CLI tool, designed to support building robust end-to-end development workflows. The Bot Framework CLI tool replaced the [legacy standalone tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Tools) used to manage bots and related services. BF CLI aggregates the collection of cross-platform tools into one cohesive and consistent interface.\n\n### Bot Framework Composer\n[Bot Framework Composer](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer/blob/main/README.md) is an integrated development tool for developers and multi-disciplinary teams to build bots and conversational experiences with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Within this tool, you'll find everything you need to build a sophisticated conversational experience.\n\n### Botkit\n[Botkit][100] is a developer tool and SDK for building chat bots, apps and custom integrations for major messaging platforms. Botkit bots `hear()` triggers, `ask()` questions and `say()` replies. Developers can use this syntax to build dialogs - now cross compatible with the latest version of Bot Framework SDK.\n\nIn addition, Botkit brings with it 6 platform adapters allowing Javascript bot applications to communicate directly with messaging platforms: [Slack][102], [Webex Teams][103], [Google Hangouts][104], [Facebook Messenger][105], [Twilio][106], and [Web chat][107].\n\nBotkit is part of Microsoft Bot Framework and is released under the [MIT Open Source license][101]\n\n[100]:https://github.com/howdyai/botkit#readme\n[101]:https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/main/LICENSE.md\n[102]:https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/main/packages/botbuilder-adapter-slack#readme\n[103]:https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/main/packages/botbuilder-adapter-webex#readme\n[104]:https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/main/packages/botbuilder-adapter-hangouts#readme\n[105]:https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/main/packages/botbuilder-adapter-facebook#readme\n[106]:https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/main/packages/botbuilder-adapter-twilio-sms#readme\n[107]:https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/main/packages/botbuilder-adapter-web#readme\n\n## Related Services\n\n### Language Understanding\nA machine learning-based service to build natural language experiences. Quickly create enterprise-ready, custom models that continuously improve. Language Understanding Service(LUIS) allows your application to understand what a person wants in their own words.

With QnA Maker, you can build, train and publish a simple question and answer bot based on FAQ URLs, structured documents, product manuals or editorial content in minutes. [[Docs][34]  | [Add qnamaker to your bot][35]]\n\n[33]:https://www.qnamaker.ai/\n[34]:https://aka.ms/qnamaker-docs-home\n[35]:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-qna?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&branch=pr-en-us-1325&tabs=cs\n\n### Dispatch\nDispatch tool lets you build language models that allow you to dispatch between disparate components (such as QnA, LUIS and custom code). [[Readme](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/blob/main/packages/Dispatch#readme)]\n\n### Speech Services\nSpeech Services convert audio to text, perform speech translation and text-to-speech with the unified Speech services. With the speech services, you can integrate speech into your bot, create custom wake words, and author in multiple languages. [[Docs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-services/)]\n\n### Adaptive Cards\n[Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io) are an open standard for developers to exchange card content in a common and consistent way,\nand are used by Bot Framework developers to create great cross-channel conversatational experiences.\n\n* **Open framework, native performance** - A simple open card format enables an ecosystem of shared tooling, seamless integration between apps, and native cross-platform performance on any device.\n* **Speech enabled from day one** - We live in an exciting era where users can talk to their devices. Adaptive Cards embrace this new world and were designed from the ground up to support these new experiences.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/main/Contributing.md).\n\n## Reporting Security Issues\nSecurity issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com).
