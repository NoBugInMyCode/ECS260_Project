It is like `gvm`, `nvm`, `rbenv` & `pyenv` (and more) all in one! Simply install your language's plugin!\n\n## Why use asdf?\n\n- single CLI for multiple languages\n- consistent commands to manage all your languages\n- single global config keeping defaults in one place\n- single `.tool-versions` config file per project\n- support for existing config files `.node-version`, `.nvmrc`, `.ruby-version` for easy migration\n- automatically switches runtime versions as you traverse your directories\n- simple plugin system to add support for your language of choice\n- shell completion available for common shells (Bash, Zsh, Fish, Elvish)\n\n## Documentation\n\n[Please head over to the documentation site for more information](https://asdf-vm.com/)!\n\n- [Getting Started](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)\n- [All Commands](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/commands.html)\n- [All Plugins](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins)\n- [Create a Plugin](https://asdf-vm.com/plugins/create.html) with our [asdf-plugin-template](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugin-template)\n- [asdf GitHub Actions](https://github.com/asdf-vm/actions)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md in the repo](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or the [Contributing section on the docs site](http://asdf-vm.com/contribute/core.html#initial-setup).\n\n## Community & Questions\n\n- [FAQ](https://asdf-vm.com/more/faq.html)\n- [![GitHub Issues](https://icongr.am/simple/github.svg?color=808080&size=16) GitHub Issues](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/issues): report a bug or raise a feature request to the `asdf` core team\n- [![StackOverflow Tag](https://icongr.am/fontawesome/stack-overflow.svg?size=16&color=808080) StackOverflow Tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asdf-vm): see existing Q&A for `asdf`. Some of the core team watch this tag in addition to our helpful community\n\n## Ballad of asdf\n\n> Once upon a time there was a programming language<br/>\n> There were many versions of it<br/>\n> So people wrote a version manager for it<br/>\n> To switch between versions for projects<br/>\n> Different, old, new.\n> \n> Then there came more programming languages<br/>\n> So there came more version managers<br/>\n> And many commands for them\n> \n> I installed a lot of them<br/>\n> I learnt a lot of commands\n> \n> Then I said, just one more version manager<br/>\n> Which I will write instead\n> \n> So, there came another version manager<br/>\n> **asdf version manager** - <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf>\n> \n> A version manager so extendable<br/>\n> for which anyone can create a plugin<br/>\n> To support their favourite language<br/>\n> No more installing more version managers<br/>\n> Or learning more commands\n\n---\n\n<figure>\n  <blockquote>\n  This was the mail I wrote to a few friends to tell them about the project.
