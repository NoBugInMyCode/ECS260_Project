It is free and open-source forever!\n\n## WARNING\n\nBevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can't guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.\n\n**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.\nAs a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to \"the latest stable release\" of Rust.\n\n## Design Goals\n\n* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set\n* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users\n* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm\n* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like\n* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel\n* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun\n\n## About\n\n* **[Features](https://bevyengine.org):** A quick overview of Bevy's features.\n* **[News](https://bevyengine.org/news/)**: A development blog that covers our progress, plans and shiny new features.\n\n## Docs\n\n* **[Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction):** Bevy's official Quick Start Guide. The best place to start learning Bevy.\n* **[Bevy Rust API Docs](https://docs.rs/bevy):** Bevy's Rust API docs, which are automatically generated from the doc comments in this repo.\n* **[Official Examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples):** Bevy's dedicated, runnable examples, which are great for digging into specific concepts.\n* **[Community-Made Learning Resources](https://bevyengine.org/assets/#learning)**: More tutorials, documentation, and examples made by the Bevy community.\n\n## Community\n\nBefore contributing or participating in discussions with the community, you should familiarize yourself with our [**Code of Conduct**](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n* **[Discord](https://discord.gg/bevy):** Bevy's official discord server.\n* **[Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/bevy):** Bevy's official subreddit.\n* **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions):** The best place for questions about Bevy, answered right here!\n* **[Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets/):** A collection of awesome Bevy projects, tools, plugins and learning materials.\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor's Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.\nFor simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or\n[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!\n\nFor more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWe recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.\n\nFollow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.\nOnce set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:\n\n```sh\n# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)\ngit checkout latest\n# Runs the \"breakout\" example\ncargo run --example breakout\n```\n\nTo draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main(){\n  App::new()\n    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n    .run();\n}\n```\n\n### Fast Compiles\n\nBevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the \"fast compiles\" setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).\n\n## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]\n\nThis [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.\n\n[cargo_features]: docs/cargo_features.md\n\n## Thanks\n\nBevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.\n\nA huge thanks to Bevy's [generous sponsors](https://bevyengine.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn't free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevyengine.org/donate/) if you like what we're building.\n\n<!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is.
