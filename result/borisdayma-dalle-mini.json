Having successful predictions on this prompt represents a big milestone for us.\n\n## Contributing\n\nJoin the community on the [LAION Discord](https://discord.gg/xBPBXfcFHd).\nAny contribution is welcome, from reporting issues to proposing fixes/improvements or testing the model with cool prompts!\n\nYou can also use these great projects from the community:\n\n* spin off your own app with
