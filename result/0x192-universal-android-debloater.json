I am not responsible for anything that\ncould happen to your phone.\n\n<img src=\"/resources/screenshots/v0.5.0.png\" width=\"850\" alt=\"uad_screenshot\">\n\n**This software is still in an early stage of development. Check out the issues, and feel free to contribute!**\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is a complete rewrite in Rust of the [UAD project](https://gitlab.com/W1nst0n/universal-android-debloater),\nwhich aims to improve privacy and battery performance by removing unnecessary\nand obscure system apps.\nThis can also contribute to improve security by reducing [the attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface).\n\nPackages are as well documented as possible in order to provide a better\nunderstanding of what you can delete or not. The worst issue that could happen\nis removing an essential system package needed during boot causing then an unfortunate\nbootloop. After about 5 failed system boots, the phone will automatically reboot\nin recovery mode, and you'll have to perform a FACTORY RESET. Make a backup first!\n\nIn any case, you **CANNOT** brick your device with this software!\nThat's the main point, right?\n\n## Features\n\n- [x] Uninstall/Disable and Restore/Enable system packages\n- [x] Multi-user support (e.g. apps in work profiles)\n- [x] Export/Import your selection in `uad_exported_selection.txt`\n- [x] Multi-device support: you can connect multiple phones at the same time\n- [x] All your actions are logged, so you never forget what you've done\n\nNB : System apps cannot truly be uninstalled without root (see the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ))\n\n## Universal Debloat Lists\n\n- [x] GFAM (Google/Facebook/Amazon/Microsoft)\n- [x] AOSP\n- [x] Manufacturers (OEM)\n- [x] Mobile carriers\n- [x] Qualcomm / Mediatek / Miscellaneous\n\n## Manufacturers debloat lists\n\n- [ ] Archos\n- [x] Asus\n- [ ] Blackberry\n- [ ] Gionee\n- [x] LG\n- [x] Google\n- [ ] iQOO\n- [x] Fairphone\n- [ ] HTC\n- [x] Huawei\n- [x] Motorola\n- [x] Nokia\n- [x] OnePlus\n- [x] Oppo\n- [x] Realme\n- [x] Samsung\n- [x] Sony\n- [x] Tecno\n- [ ] TCL\n- [x] Unihertz\n- [x] Vivo/iQOO\n- [ ] Wiko\n- [x] Xiaomi\n- [x] ZTE\n\n## Mobile carriers debloat lists\n\n| Country | Carriers                        |\n| ------- | ------------------------------- |\n| France  | Orange, SFR, Free, Bouygues     |\n| USA     | T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, AT&T |\n| Germany | Telekom                         |\n| UK      | EE                              |\n\n## How to use it\n\n- **Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ)!**\n- **Do a proper backup of your data! You can never be too careful!**\n- Enable _Developer Options_ on your smartphone.\n- Turn on _USB Debugging_ from the developer panel.\n- From the settings, disconnect from any OEM accounts (when you delete an OEM\n  account package it could lock you on the lockscreen because the phone can't\n  associate your identity anymore)\n- Install ADB (see the intructions by clicking on your OS below):\n  <p>\n  <details>\n  <summary>LINUX</summary>\n\n  - Install _Android platform tools_ on your PC :\n\n  Debian Base:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools\n  ```\n\n  Arch-Linux Base:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo pacman -S android-tools\n  ```\n\n  Red Hat Base:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo yum install android-tools\n  ```\n\n  OpenSUSE Base:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo zypper install android-tools\n  ```\n\n  </details>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n  <details>\n  <summary>MAC OS</summary>\n\n  - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)\n  - Install _Android platform tools_\n\n    ```bash\n    brew install android-platform-tools\n    ```\n\n    </details>\n    </p>\n\n  <p>\n  <details>\n  <summary>WINDOWS</summary>\n\n  - Download [android platform tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)\n    and unzip it somewhere.\n  - [Add the android platform tools to your PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)\n    **OR** make sure to launch UAD from the same directory.\n\n  - [Install USB drivers for your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb#Drivers)\n  - Check your device is detected:\n\n    ```bash\n     adb devices\n    ```\n\n    </details>\n    </p>\n\n- Download the latest release of UAD GUI for your Operating System [here](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/releases).\n  Take the `opengl` version only if the default version (with a Vulkan backend)\n  doesn't launch.\n\n**NOTE:** Chinese phones users may need to use the AOSP list for removing some stock\napps because those Chinese manufacturers (especially Xiaomi and Huawei) have been\nusing the name of AOSP packages for their own (modified & closed-source) apps.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You will have to run this software whenever your OEM pushes\nan update to your phone as some _uninstalled_ system apps could be reinstalled.\n\n## How to contribute\n\nHey-hey-hey! Don't go away so fast! This is a community project.\nThat means I need you! I'm sure you want to make this project better anyway.\n\n==> [How to contribute](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki)\n\n## Special thanks\n\n- [@mawilms](https://github.com/mawilms) for his LotRO plugin manager ([Lembas](https://github.com/mawilms/lembas))\n  which helped me a lot to understand how to use the [Iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced)\n  GUI library.\n- [@casperstorm](https://github.com/casperstorm) for the UI/UX inspiration.\n",
