It offers hardening, posture management, and runtime security capabilities to ensure robust protection for Kubernetes environments. It saves Kubernetes users and admins precious time, effort, and resources.\n\nKubescape scans clusters, YAML files, and Helm charts. It detects misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks (including [NSA-CISA](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubernetes-hardening-guidance-summary-by-armo/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository), [MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae](https://www.armosec.io/glossary/mitre-attck-framework/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository) and the [CIS Benchmark](https://www.armosec.io/blog/cis-kubernetes-benchmark-framework-scanning-tools-comparison/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository)).\n\nKubescape was created by [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository) and is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/).\n\n_Please [star \u2b50](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/stargazers) the repo if you want us to continue developing and improving Kubescape! \ud83d\ude00_\n\n## Demo\n\nKubescape has a command line tool that you can use to quickly get a report on the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster:\n\n<img src=\"docs/img/demo-v3.gif\">\n\n## Getting started\n\nExperimenting with Kubescape is as easy as:\n\n```sh\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubescape/kubescape/master/install.sh | /bin/bash\n```\n\nThis script will automatically download the latest Kubescape CLI release and scan the Kubernetes cluster in your current kubectl context.\n\nLearn more about:\n\n* [Installing the Kubescape CLI](https://kubescape.io/docs/install-cli/)\n* [Running your first scan](https://kubescape.io/docs/scanning/)\n* [Accepting risk with exceptions](https://kubescape.io/docs/accepting-risk/)\n\n_Did you know you can use Kubescape in all these places?_\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"docs/img/ksfromcodetodeploy.png\" alt=\"Places you can use Kubescape: in your IDE, CI, CD, or against a running cluster.\">\n</div>\n\n### Continuous security monitoring with the Kubescape Operator\n\nAs well as a CLI, Kubescape provides an in-cluster mode, which is installed via a Helm chart. Kubescape in-cluster provides extensive features such as continuous scanning, image vulnerability scanning, runtime analysis, network policy generation, and more. [Learn more about the Kubescape operator](https://kubescape.io/docs/operator/).\n\n### Using Kubescape as a GitHub Action\n\nKubescape can be used as a GitHub Action. This is a great way to integrate Kubescape into your CI/CD pipeline. You can find the Kubescape GitHub Action in the [GitHub Action marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kubescape).\n\n## Under the hood\n\nKubescape uses [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) to verify Kubernetes objects against [a library of posture controls](https://github.com/kubescape/regolibrary).\nFor image scanning, it uses [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype).  \nFor image patching, it uses [Copacetic](https://github.com/project-copacetic/copacetic).\nFor eBPF, it uses [Inspektor Gadget](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget)\n\nBy default, CLI scan results are printed in a console-friendly manner, but they can be:\n\n* exported to JSON, junit XML or SARIF\n* rendered to HTML or PDF\n* submitted to a [cloud service](docs/providers.md)\n\n### In-cluster architecture \n\n![Architecture diagram](docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)\n\n## Community\n\nKubescape is an open source project. We welcome your feedback and ideas for improvement. We are part of the CNCF community and are evolving Kubescape in sync with the security needs of Kubernetes users. To learn more about where Kubescape is heading, please check out our [ROADMAP](https://github.com/kubescape/project-governance/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).\n\nIf you feel inspired to contribute to Kubescape, check out our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/kubescape/project-governance/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file to learn how. You can find the issues we are working on (triage to development) on the [Kubescaping board](https://github.com/orgs/kubescape/projects/4/views/1)\n\n* Feel free to pick a task from the [board](https://github.com/orgs/kubescape/projects/4) or suggest a feature of your own.\n* Open an issue on the board. We aim to respond to all issues within 48 hours.\n* [Join the CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) and then our [users](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C04EY3ZF9GE) or [developers](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C04GY6H082K) channel.\n\nThe Kubescape project follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).\n\nFor more information about the Kubescape community, please visit [COMMUNITY](https://github.com/kubescape/project-governance/blob/main/COMMUNITY.md).\n\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank all our contibutors to date.\n\n<br>\n\n<a href = \"https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src = \"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=kubescape/kubescape\"/>\n</a>\n\n## Changelog\n\nKubescape changes are tracked on the [release](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/releases) page.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2021-2024, the Kubescape Authors.
