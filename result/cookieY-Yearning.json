It also supports text-to-SQL conversion, allowing users to input natural language and receive optimized SQL statements.\n  \n- **SQL Audit**: Create SQL audit tickets with approval workflows and automated syntax checks. Validate SQL statements for correctness, security, and compliance. Rollback statements are automatically generated for DDL/DML operations, with a comprehensive history log for traceability.\n\n- **Query Audit**: Audit user queries, restrict data sources and databases, and anonymize sensitive fields. Query records are saved for future reference.\n\n- **Check Rules**: Our automated syntax checker supports a wide range of check rules, suitable for most automatic checking scenarios.\n\n- **Privacy Focused**: Yearning is a locally deployable, open-source solution that ensures the security of your database and SQL statements. It includes encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data, ensuring it remains secure even if unauthorized access occurs.\n\n- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Create and manage roles with specific permissions, restricting access to query work orders, auditing functions, and other sensitive operations based on user roles.\n\n> \\[!TIP]\n> For more detailed information, visit our [Yearning Guide](https://next.yearning.io)\n\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f Installation\n\nDownload the [latest release](https://github.com/cookieY/Yearning/releases/latest) and extract it.
