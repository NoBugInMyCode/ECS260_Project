From an app developer's side, it should be really straightforward to create an installer for my app, and publish updates to it, without having to jump through insane hoops. \n\n* **Integrating** an app to use Squirrel should be extremely easy, provide a client API, and be developer friendly.\n* **Packaging** is really easy, can be automated, and supports delta update packages.\n* **Distributing** should be straightforward, use simple HTTP updates, and provide multiple \"channels\" (a-la Chrome Dev/Beta/Release).\n* **Installing** is Wizard-Free\u2122, with no UAC dialogs, does not require reboot, and is .NET Framework friendly.\n* **Updating** is in the background, doesn't interrupt the user, and does not require a reboot.\n\nRefer to our full list of goals for [integrating, packaging, distributing, installing, and updating](docs/goals.md).\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee the documentation [Table of Contents](docs/readme.md) for an overview of the available documentation for Squirrel.Windows. It includes a [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started/0-overview.md) as well as additional topics related to using Squirrel in your applications. \n\n## Building Squirrel\nFor the impatient:\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/squirrel/squirrel.windows\ncd squirrel.windows\ndevbuild.cmd\n```\nSee [Contributing](docs/contributing/contributing.md) for additional information on building and contributing to Squirrel.\n\n\n## License and Usage\n\nSee [COPYING](COPYING) for details on copyright and usage of the Squirrel.Windows software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
