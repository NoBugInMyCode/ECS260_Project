Besides that, Medis 2 is rewritten from the beginning with native technology, making it more morden, beautiful, and fast!\n\nWhat's more, **Medis 2 is free \ud83d\udcb0 to download**! Don't hesitate, download it from the App Store now and try it out!\n\n[![Download on the App Store](http://getmedis.com/download.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/medis-2-gui-for-redis/id1579200037?mt=12)\n\n_(or searching \"Medis 2\" on macOS App Store if the above link doesn't work for you. Also, you can download the app directly from the [official website](https://getmedis.com/))_\n\n![Medis](http://getmedis.com/screen.png)\n\n---\n\nMedis is a beautiful, easy-to-use Redis management application built on the modern web with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux). It's powered by many awesome Node.js modules, especially [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) and [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2).\n\n[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)\n\nMedis starts with all the basic features you need:\n\n- Keys viewing/editing\n- SSH Tunnel for connecting with remote servers\n- Terminal for executing custom commands\n- Config viewing/editing\n\nIt also supports many advanced features:\n\n- JSON/MessagePack format viewing/editing and built-in highlighting/validator\n- Working with millions keys and key members without blocking the redis server\n- Pattern manager for easy selecting a sub group of keys.\n\n**Note**: Medis only supports Redis >= 2.8 version because `SCAN` command was introduced since 2.8. `SCAN` is very useful to get key list without blocking the server, which is crucial to the production environment. Because the latest stable is 5.0 and 2.6 is a very old version, Medis doesn't support it.\n\n<hr />\n\n## Download Medis on Windows\n\nYou can download compiled installer of Medis for Windows from the below page\n[download page](https://github.com/classfellow/medis/releases/tag/win)\n\n## Download Medis on Mac\n\nYou can download compiled versions of Medis for Mac OS X from [the release page](https://github.com/luin/medis/releases).\n\n## Running Locally\n\n1. Install dependencies\n\n```\n    $ npm install\n```\n\n2. Compile assets:\n\n```\n    $ npm run pack\n```\n\n3. Run with Electron:\n\n```\n    $ npm start\n```\n\n## Connect to Heroku\n\nMedis can connect to Heroku Redis addon to manage your data. You just need to call `heroku redis:credentials --app APP` to get your redis credential:\n\n```shell\n$ heroku redis:credentials --app YOUR_APP\nredis://x:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT\n```\n\nAnd then input `HOST`, `PORT` and `PASSWORD` to the connection tab.\n\n## I Love This. How do I Help?\n\n- Simply star this repository :-)\n- Help us spread the world on Facebook and Twitter\n- Contribute Code! We're developers! (See Roadmap below)\n- Medis is available on the Mac App Store as a paid software. I'll be very grateful if you'd like to buy it to encourage me to continue maintaining Medis. There are no additional features comparing with the open-sourced version, except the fact that you can enjoy auto updating that brought by the Mac App Store. <br> [![Download on the App Store](http://getmedis.com/download.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/medis-2-gui-for-redis/id1579200037?mt=12)\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- Windows and Linux version (with electron-packager)\n- Support for SaaS Redis services\n- Lua script editor\n- Cluster management\n- GEO keys supporting\n\n## Contributors\n\n<table><tr><td width=\"20%\"><a href=\"https://github.com/luin\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/635902?v=3\" /></a><p align=\"center\">luin</p></td><td width=\"20%\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kvnsmth\"><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/127?v=3\" /></a><p align=\"center\">kvnsmth</p></td><td width=\"20%\"><a href=\"https://github.com/dpde\"><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/485645?v=3\" /></a><p align=\"center\">dpde</p></td><td width=\"20%\"><a href=\"https://github.com/ogasawaraShinnosuke\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5368888?v=3\" /></a><p align=\"center\">ogasawaraShinnosuke</p></td><td width=\"20%\"><a href=\"https://github.com/naholyr\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/214067?v=3\" /></a><p align=\"center\">naholyr</p></td></tr><tr><td width=\"20%\"><a href=\"https://github.com/hlobil\"><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/484499?v=3\" /></a><p align=\"center\">hlobil</p></td><td width=\"20%\"><a href=\"https://github.com/Janpot\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2109932?v=3\" /></a><p align=\"center\">Janpot</p></td></table>\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
