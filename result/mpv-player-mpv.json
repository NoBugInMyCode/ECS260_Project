It supports\na wide variety of media file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types.\n\nThere is a [FAQ][FAQ].\n\nReleases can be found on the [release list][releases].\n\n## System requirements\n\n- A not too ancient Linux (usually, only the latest releases of distributions\n  are actively supported), Windows 10 1607 or later, or macOS 10.15 or later.\n- A somewhat capable CPU. Hardware decoding might help if the CPU is too slow to\n  decode video in realtime, but must be explicitly enabled with the `--hwdec`\n  option.\n- A not too crappy GPU. mpv's focus is not on power-efficient playback on\n  embedded or integrated GPUs (for example, hardware decoding is not even\n  enabled by default). Low power GPUs may cause issues like tearing, stutter,\n  etc. On such GPUs, it's recommended to use `--profile=fast` for smooth playback.\n  The main video output uses shaders for video rendering and scaling,\n  rather than GPU fixed function hardware. On Windows, you might want to make\n  sure the graphics drivers are current. In some cases, ancient fallback video\n  output methods can help (such as `--vo=xv` on Linux), but this use is not\n  recommended or supported.\n\nmpv does not go out of its way to break on older hardware or old, unsupported\noperating systems, but development is not done with them in mind. Keeping\ncompatibility with such setups is not guaranteed. If things work, consider it\na happy accident.\n\n## Downloads\n\n\nFor semi-official builds and third-party packages please see\n[mpv.io/installation](https://mpv.io/installation/).\n\n## Changelog\n\n\nThere is no complete changelog; however, changes to the player core interface\nare listed in the [interface changelog][interface-changes].\n\nChanges to the C API are documented in the [client API changelog][api-changes].\n\nThe [release list][releases] has a summary of most of the important changes\non every release.\n\nChanges to the default key bindings are indicated in\n[restore-old-bindings.conf][restore-old-bindings].\n\nChanges to the default OSC bindings are indicated in\n[restore-osc-bindings.conf][restore-osc-bindings].\n\n## Compilation\n\n\nCompiling with full features requires development files for several\nexternal libraries. Mpv requires [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html)\nto build. Meson can be obtained from your distro or PyPI.\n\nAfter creating your build directory (e.g. `meson setup build`), you can view a list\nof all the build options via `meson configure build`. You could also just simply\nlook at the `meson_options.txt` file. Logs are stored in `meson-logs` within\nyour build directory.\n\nExample:\n\n    meson setup build\n    meson compile -C build\n    meson install -C build\n\nFor libplacebo, meson can use a git check out as a subproject for a convenient\nway to compile mpv if a sufficient libplacebo version is not easily available\nin the build environment. It will be statically linked with mpv. Example:\n\n    mkdir -p subprojects\n    git clone https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libplacebo.git --depth=1 --recursive subprojects/libplacebo\n\nEssential dependencies (incomplete list):\n\n- gcc or clang\n- X development headers (xlib, xrandr, xext, xscrnsaver, xpresent, libvdpau,\n  libGL, GLX, EGL, xv, ...)\n- Audio output development headers (libasound/ALSA, pulseaudio)\n- FFmpeg libraries (libavutil libavcodec libavformat libswscale libavfilter\n  and either libswresample or libavresample)\n- libplacebo\n- zlib\n- iconv (normally provided by the system libc)\n- libass (OSD, OSC, text subtitles)\n- Lua (optional, required for the OSC pseudo-GUI and youtube-dl integration)\n- libjpeg (optional, used for screenshots only)\n- uchardet (optional, for subtitle charset detection)\n- nvdec and vaapi libraries for hardware decoding on Linux (optional)\n\nLibass dependencies (when building libass):\n\n- gcc or clang, nasm on x86 and x86_64\n- fribidi, freetype, fontconfig development headers (for libass)\n- harfbuzz (required for correct rendering of combining characters, particularly\n  for correct rendering of non-English text on macOS, and Arabic/Indic scripts on\n  any platform)\n\nFFmpeg dependencies (when building FFmpeg):\n\n- gcc or clang, nasm on x86 and x86_64\n- OpenSSL or GnuTLS (have to be explicitly enabled when compiling FFmpeg)\n- libx264/libmp3lame/libfdk-aac if you want to use encoding (have to be\n  explicitly enabled when compiling FFmpeg)\n- For native DASH playback, FFmpeg needs to be built with --enable-libxml2\n  (although there are security implications, and DASH support has lots of bugs).\n- AV1 decoding support requires dav1d.\n- For good nvidia support on Linux, make sure nv-codec-headers is installed\n  and can be found by configure.\n\nMost of the above libraries are available in suitable versions on normal\nLinux distributions. For ease of compiling the latest git master of everything,\nyou may wish to use the separately available build wrapper ([mpv-build][mpv-build])\nwhich first compiles FFmpeg libraries and libass, and then compiles the player\nstatically linked against those.\n\nIf you want to build a Windows binary, see [Windows compilation][windows_compilation].\n\n\n## Release cycle\n\nOnce or twice a year, a release is cut off from the current development state\nand is assigned a 0.X.0 version number. No further maintenance is done, except\nin the event of security issues.\n\nThe goal of releases is to make Linux distributions happy. Linux distributions\nare also expected to apply their own patches in case of bugs.\n\nReleases other than the latest release are unsupported and unmaintained.\n\nSee the [release policy document][release-policy] for more information.\n\n## Bug reports\n\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker][issue-tracker] provided by GitHub to send us bug\nreports or feature requests. Follow the template's instructions or the issue\nwill likely be ignored or closed as invalid.\n\nQuestions can be asked in the [discussions][discussions] or on IRC (see\n[Contact](#Contact) below).\n\n## Contributing\n\n\nPlease read [contribute.md][contribute.md].\n\nFor small changes you can just send us pull requests through GitHub. For bigger\nchanges come and talk to us on IRC before you start working on them. It will\nmake code review easier for both parties later on.\n\nYou can check [the wiki](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/Stuff-to-do)\nor the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ameta%3Afeature-request)\nfor ideas on what you could contribute with.\n\n## License\n\nGPLv2 \"or later\" by default, LGPLv2.1 \"or later\" with `-Dgpl=false`.\nSee [details.](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/Copyright)\n\n## History\n\nThis software is based on the MPlayer project. Before mpv existed as a project,\nthe code base was briefly developed under the mplayer2 project. For details,\nsee the [FAQ][FAQ].\n\n## Contact\n\n\nMost activity happens on the IRC channel and the GitHub issue tracker.\n\n- **GitHub issue tracker**: [issue tracker][issue-tracker] (report bugs here)\n- **Discussions**: [discussions][discussions]\n- **User IRC Channel**: `#mpv` on `irc.libera.chat`\n- **Developer IRC Channel**: `#mpv-devel` on `irc.libera.chat`\n\n[FAQ]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/FAQ\n[releases]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/releases\n[mpv-build]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build\n[issue-tracker]:  https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues\n[discussions]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/discussions\n[release-policy]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/release-policy.md\n[windows_compilation]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/compile-windows.md\n[interface-changes]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/interface-changes.rst\n[api-changes]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/client-api-changes.rst\n[restore-old-bindings]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/restore-old-bindings.conf\n[restore-osc-bindings]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/restore-osc-bindings.conf\n[contribute.md]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/contribute.md\n",
