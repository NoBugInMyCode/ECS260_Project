Thanks for visiting!\n\n**Thanks to everyone who reported bugs in the 0th and &frac12;th editions!**\n\n**To report an error, please [post an issue](https://github.com/jeffgerickson/algorithms/issues).**  \n* Before submitting, please check that your error hasn't already been fixed in the most recent revision.\n* For an error in the book, please include the chapter, section, and page numbers.\n* For an error in the non-book lecture notes, please include the title and *the complete URL* of the note in question.  (There are _lots_ of old revisions floating around the web, with inconsistent titling and numbering, so just the title or the file name may not be enough.)\n* For an error in **this** semester's homework, labs, exams, or solutions, please post on the course's Piazza site for extra credit, **not** here.\n* For an error in a *past* semester's homework, labs, exams, or solutions, please post here, but again with *the complete URL* of the work in question.\n\nPlease also feel free to submit feature requests and other feedback.\n\nWhile you're here, please feel free to download a complete copy of the most recent revision of the entire book or any of the individual chapters.  (The individual chapters are extracted from the book pdf file to keep page numbers consistent; unfortunately, hyperlinks don\u2019t work.)\n\nA black and white electronic version of the entire manuscript is also available, which should more closely reflect the appearance of the printed volume.  I won\u2019t update that quite as often.\n\n---\n### Publication History\n\nThe most up-to-date version of the book and individual chapters is in the top-level directory.  Archival snapshots of official releases (\u201ceditions\u201d or \u201cprintings\u201d) are in corresponding subdirectories.  See the [Errata](ERRATA.md) for a list of updates since the most recent official release.\n\n- **0th edition** (prepublication draft) \u2014 December 29, 2018\n- **&frac12;th edition** (prepublication draft) \u2014 April 9, 2019\n- **1st paperback edition** \u2014 June 13, 2019 \u2014 Amazon links:\n\t[US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1792644833),\n\t[UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1792644833),\n\t[DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/1792644833),\n\t[ES](https://www.amazon.es/dp/1792644833),\n\t[FR](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/1792644833),\n\t[IT](https://www.amazon.it/dp/1792644833),\n\t[JP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/1792644833)\n\n---\n### Additional Materials\n\nThe book contains only a small subset of my course materials; you can find hundreds more pages of lecture notes, lab handouts, and past homeworks and exams at  http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms, or at the mnemonic shortcut http://algorithms.wtf.  You can see the material in context at the web sites for my most recent offerings of [CS 374](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374/sp2018/A) and [CS 473](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs473/sp2017) at Illinois.\n\nAt some future date, I am likely to incorporate more (but definitely not all) of these lecture notes into a future edition.  (I haven't decided whether I'm going to call it a \"director's cut\" or an \"extended dance remix\".)  One step at a time.\n\n---\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright 2019 Jeff Erickson\n\nEverything _on this site_ is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\nFor license details, see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.\n",
