Tink is a crypto library written by a\ngroup of cryptographers and security engineers at Google. It was born out of our\nextensive experience working with Google's product teams,\n[fixing weaknesses in implementations](https://github.com/google/wycheproof),\nand providing simple APIs that can be used safely without needing a crypto\nbackground.\n\nTink provides secure APIs that are easy to use correctly and hard(er) to misuse.\nIt reduces common crypto pitfalls with user-centered design, careful\nimplementation and code reviews, and extensive testing. At Google, Tink is one\nof the standard crypto libraries, and has been deployed in hundreds of products\nand systems.\n\nTo get a quick overview of Tink design please take a look at\n[slides][tink_talk_slides] from [a talk about Tink][tink_talk_recording]\npresented at [Real World Crypto 2019](https://rwc.iacr.org/2019/).\n\n[devs_are_users_too_slides]: https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/hotsec15_slides_green.pdf\n[tink_talk_slides]: docs/Tink-a_cryptographic_library--RealWorldCrypto2019.pdf\n[tink_talk_recording]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqev9r3rUJs&t=9665\n\n## Current status\n\n[Java/Android](docs/JAVA-HOWTO.md), [C++](docs/CPP-HOWTO.md),\n[Obj-C](docs/OBJC-HOWTO.md), [Go](docs/GOLANG-HOWTO.md), and\n[Python](docs/PYTHON-HOWTO.md) are field tested and ready for production. The\nlatest version is [1.7.0](https://github.com/google/tink/releases/tag/v1.7.0),\nreleased on 2022-08-09.\n\nJavascript/Typescript is in an alpha state and should only be used for testing.\nPlease see the intent to remove statement\n[here](https://github.com/google/tink/issues/689).\n\n**`Ubuntu`**                        | **`macOS`**\n----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------\n[![Kokoro Ubuntu][ubuntu_badge]](#) | [![Kokoro macOS][macos_badge]](#)\n\n[ubuntu_badge]: https://storage.googleapis.com/tink-kokoro-build-badges/tink-ubuntu.png\n[macos_badge]: https://storage.googleapis.com/tink-kokoro-build-badges/tink-macos.png\n\n## Getting started\n\nDocumentation for the project is located at https://developers.google.com/tink.\nCurrently, it details a variety of common usage scenarios and covers the Java\nand Python implementations. The site will be populated with more content over\ntime.\n\nAlternatively, you can look at all of the [`examples`] which demonstrate\nperforming simple tasks using Tink in a variety of languages.\n\n[`examples`]: https://github.com/google/tink/tree/master/examples\n\n*   Python\n\n```sh\npip3 install tink\n```\n\n*   Golang\n\n```sh\ngo get github.com/google/tink/go/...\n```\n\n*   Java\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.google.crypto.tink</groupId>\n  <artifactId>tink</artifactId>\n  <version>1.7.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n*   Android\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  implementation 'com.google.crypto.tink:tink-android:1.7.0'\n}\n```\n\n*   Objective-C/iOS\n\n```sh\ncd /path/to/your/Xcode project/\npod init\npod 'Tink', '1.7.0'\npod install\n```\n\n## Learn more\n\n*   [Java HOW-TO](docs/JAVA-HOWTO.md)\n*   [C++ HOW-TO](docs/CPP-HOWTO.md)\n*   [Obj-C HOW-TO](docs/OBJC-HOWTO.md)\n*   [Go HOW-TO](docs/GOLANG-HOWTO.md)\n*   [Python HOW-TO](docs/PYTHON-HOWTO.md)\n*   [Security and Usability Design Goals](docs/SECURITY-USABILITY.md)\n*   [Supported Crypto Primitives](docs/PRIMITIVES.md)\n*   [Key Management](docs/KEY-MANAGEMENT.md)\n*   [Managing keys with Tinkey](docs/TINKEY.md)\n*   [Known Issues](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md)\n\n## Community-driven ports\n\nOut of the box Tink supports a wide range of languages, but it still doesn't\nsupport every language. Fortunately, some users like Tink so much that they've\nported it to their favorite languages! Below you can find notable ports.\n\n**WARNING** While we usually review these ports, until further notice, we do not\nmaintain them and have no plan to support them in the foreseeable future.\n\n*   [Clojure](https://github.com/perkss/tinklj)\n\n## Contact and mailing list\n\nIf you want to contribute, please read [CONTRIBUTING](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and\nsend us pull requests. You can also report bugs or file feature requests.\n\nIf you'd like to talk to the developers or get notified about major product\nupdates, you may want to subscribe to our [mailing list][tink_mailing_list_url].\n\n## Maintainers\n\nTink is maintained by (A-Z):\n\n-   Moreno Ambrosin\n-   Taymon Beal\n-   Daniel Bleichenbacher\n-   William Conner\n-   Thai Duong\n-   Thomas Holenstein\n-   Stefan K\u00f6lbl\n-   Charles Lee\n-   Cindy Lin\n-   Fernando Lobato Meeser\n-   Atul Luykx\n-   Rafael Misoczki\n-   Sophie Schmieg\n-   Laurent Simon\n-   Elizaveta Tretiakova\n-   J\u00fcrg Wullschleger\n\nAlumni:\n\n-   Haris Andrianakis\n-   Tanuj Dhir\n-   Quan Nguyen\n-   Bartosz Przydatek\n-   Enzo Puig\n-   Veronika Sl\u00edvov\u00e1\n-   Paula Vidas\n-   Cathie Yun\n-   Federico Zalcberg\n",
