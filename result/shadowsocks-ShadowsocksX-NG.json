It's crazy to maintain dependencies of `ss-local`.\nSo it's hard to update the `ss-local` version.\n\nNow I just copied the `ss-local` from Homebrew. Run `ss-local` executable as a Launch Agent in the background.\nSo there is only some source code related to GUI left.\nThen I have rewrited the GUI code in Swift.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Running\n\nmacOS 10.12+\n\n### Building\n\n- Xcode 12.5.1+\n- CocoaPods 1.10.1+\n\n## Download\n\nFrom [here](https://github.com/shadowsocks/ShadowsocksX-NG/releases/)\n\n## Features\n\n- `ss-local` from shadowsocks-libev 3.2.5.\n- Support SIP003 plugins. Embed `kcptun`,  `simple-obfs` and `v2ray-plugin`.\n- Could update PAC by download GFW List from GitHub.\n- Share your server profiles by qrcode or url.\n- Import server profile urls from pasteboard.\n- Import server profile by scan QRCode on screen.\n- Custom rules for PAC.\n- Support for [AEAD Ciphers](https://shadowsocks.org/en/spec/AEAD-Ciphers.html)\n- HTTP Proxy by [privoxy](http://www.privoxy.org/)\n\n## Difference from original ShadowsocksX\n\n`ss-local` is run as a background service through launchd, not as an in-app process.\nSo after you quit the app, the `ss-local` might be still running.\n\nAdded a manual mode which won't configure the system proxy settings,\nso that you could configure your apps to use the SOCKS5 proxy manually.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions must be available on a separately named branch based on the latest version of the main branch `develop`.\n\nref: [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)\n\n## License\n\nThe project is released under the terms of the GPLv3.\n\n",
