        "readme": "# Pure CSS Francine\n\nAn ongoing series in which I create art using only CSS and HTML.\n\nRules I have for myself:\n\n1. All elements must be typed out by hand\n2. Only Atom text editor and Chrome Developer Tools allowed.\n3. ~~SVG use is limited, and all shapes can only use hand-plotted coordinates and bezier curves - without the aid of any graphics editor.~~\n(Note: at one point I was using one or two SVG elements but I eventually grew tired of them and they've since been deleted, so this rule no longer applies. No offense to SVG.)\n\nBecause of the artistic nature of this project I have not concerned myself with cross-browser-compatibility, so the live preview will most likely look laughable in anything other than chrome.\n\n[cyanharlow.github.io/purecss-francine](https://cyanharlow.github.io/purecss-francine/)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyanharlow/purecss-francine/master/preview.jpg)\n",
