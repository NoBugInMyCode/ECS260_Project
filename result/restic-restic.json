It supports the three major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and a few smaller ones (FreeBSD, OpenBSD).\n\nFor detailed usage and installation instructions check out the [documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest).\n\nYou can ask questions in our [Discourse forum](https://forum.restic.net).\n\n## Quick start\n\nOnce you've [installed](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/020_installation.html) restic, start\noff with creating a repository for your backups:\n\n    $ restic init --repo /tmp/backup\n    enter password for new backend:\n    enter password again:\n    created restic backend 085b3c76b9 at /tmp/backup\n    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access the repository.\n    Losing your password means that your data is irrecoverably lost.\n\nand add some data:\n\n    $ restic --repo /tmp/backup backup ~/work\n    enter password for repository:\n    scan [/home/user/work]\n    scanned 764 directories, 1816 files in 0:00\n    [0:29] 100.00%  54.732 MiB/s  1.582 GiB / 1.582 GiB  2580 / 2580 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00\n    duration: 0:29, 54.47MiB/s\n    snapshot 40dc1520 saved\n\nNext you can either use `restic restore` to restore files or use `restic\nmount` to mount the repository via fuse and browse the files from previous\nsnapshots.\n\nFor more options check out the [online documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n# Backends\n\nSaving a backup on the same machine is nice but not a real backup strategy.\nTherefore, restic supports the following backends for storing backups natively:\n\n- [Local directory](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#local)\n- [sftp server (via SSH)](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#sftp)\n- [HTTP REST server](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server) ([protocol](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#rest-backend), [rest-server](https://github.com/restic/rest-server))\n- [Amazon S3](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#amazon-s3) (either from Amazon or using the [Minio](https://minio.io) server)\n- [OpenStack Swift](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#openstack-swift)\n- [BackBlaze B2](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#backblaze-b2)\n- [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#microsoft-azure-blob-storage)\n- [Google Cloud Storage](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#google-cloud-storage)\n- And many other services via the [rclone](https://rclone.org) [Backend](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#other-services-via-rclone)\n\n# Design Principles\n\nRestic is a program that does backups right and was designed with the\nfollowing principles in mind:\n\n-  **Easy**: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise\n   you might be tempted to skip it. Restic should be easy to configure\n   and use, so that, in the event of a data loss, you can just restore\n   it. Likewise, restoring data should not be complicated.\n\n-  **Fast**: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by\n   your network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files\n   every day. Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring\n   backups should only transfer data that is needed for the files that\n   are to be restored, so that this process is also fast.\n\n-  **Verifiable**: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic\n   enables you to easily verify that all data can be restored.\n\n-  **Secure**: Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and\n   integrity of your data. The location the backup data is stored is\n   assumed not to be a trusted environment (e.g. a shared space where\n   others like system administrators are able to access your backups).\n   Restic is built to secure your data against such attackers.\n\n-  **Efficient**: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should\n   only take the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate\n   data should be de-duplicated before it is actually written to the\n   storage back end to save precious backup space.\n\n# Reproducible Builds\n\nThe binaries released with each restic version starting at 0.6.1 are\n[reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can\nreproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that\nrelease. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the\n[builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).\n\n## News\n\nYou can follow the restic project on Mastodon [@resticbackup](https://fosstodon.org/@restic) or subscribe to\nthe [project blog](https://restic.net/blog/).\n\n## License\n\nRestic is licensed under [BSD 2-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).
