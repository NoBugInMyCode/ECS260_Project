That way the\n_server_ downloads the web pages and uses the limited bandwidth of an\nSSH connection to display the result. However, traditional text-based browsers\nlack JS and all other modern HTML5 support. Browsh is different\nin that it's backed by a real browser, namely headless Firefox,\nto create a purely text-based version of web pages and web apps. These can be easily\nrendered in a terminal or indeed, ironically, in another browser. Do note that currently the browser client doesn't have feature parity with the terminal client.\n\nWhy not VNC? Well VNC is certainly one solution but it doesn't quite\nhave the same ability to deal with extremely bad Internet. Terminal \nBrowsh can also use MoSH to further reduce bandwidth and increase stability\nof the connection. Mosh offers features like automatic\nreconnection of dropped or roamed connections and diff-only screen updates.\nFurthermore, other than SSH or MoSH, terminal Browsh doesn't require a client\nlike VNC.\n\nOne final reason to use terminal Browsh could be to offload the battery-drain of a modern\nbrowser from your laptop or low-powered device like a Raspberry Pi. If you're a CLI-native,\nthen you could potentially get a few more hours of life if your CPU-hungry browser\nis running somewhere else on mains electricity.\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload a binary from the [releases](https://github.com/browsh-org/browsh/releases) (~11MB).\nYou will need to have [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) already installed.\n\nOr download and run the Docker image (~230MB) with:\n    `docker run --rm -it browsh/browsh`\n\n## Usage\nMost keys and mouse gestures should work as you'd expect on a desktop\nbrowser.\n\nFor full documentation click [here](https://www.brow.sh/docs/introduction/).\n\n## Contributing\n_Note that some of these instructions may be out of date (July 2022)_\n\nFor generic Linux systems you can follow [this guide](https://github.com/browsh-org/browsh/blob/master/SETUP_DEV_LINUX.md) on how to setup a build environment, that you may be able to adapt for other systems as well.\n\nWindows users can follow [this guide](https://github.com/browsh-org/browsh/blob/master/SETUP_DEV_WIN.md) in order to set up a build environment.\n\nMac users may follow [this guide](https://github.com/browsh-org/browsh/blob/master/SETUP_DEV_OSX.md) that goes through the steps of setting up a build environment.\n\n### Communication\nQuestions about Brow.sh?
