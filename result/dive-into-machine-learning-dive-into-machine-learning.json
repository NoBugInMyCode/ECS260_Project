You might find this resource helpful if:\n\n* You know Python or [you're](https://github.com/alexmojaki/futurecoder) [learning](https://nbviewer.org/github/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/Index.ipynb) [it](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#resources) [:snake:](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#introduction-to-programming)\n* You're new to [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)\n* You care about [the ethics of ML](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-artificial-intelligence-guidelines)\n  * **[8 Responsible Machine Learning Principles](https://ethical.institute/principles.html)**\n  * [Open Ethics Canvas](https://openethics.ai/canvas/)\n* You learn by doing\n\nFor some great alternatives, [jump to the end](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning#more-ways-to-dive-into-machine-learning) or [check out Nam Vu's guide, Machine Learning for Software Engineers](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers).\n\nOf course, there is no easy path to expertise. Also, _I'm not an expert!_ I just want to connect you with some great resources _from_ experts. Applications of ML are all around us. I think it's in the public interest for more people to learn more about ML, especially hands-on, because there are many different ways to learn.\n\nWhatever motivates _you_ to dive into machine learning, if you know a bit of Python, these days you can get hands-on with a machine learning _\"Hello World!\"_ in minutes.\n\n# Let's get started\n\n## Tools you'll need\n\n### If you prefer local installation\n\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python 3 is the best option.\n* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). (Formerly known as IPython Notebook.)\n* Some scientific computing packages:\n  * numpy\n  * pandas\n  * scikit-learn\n  * matplotlib\n\nYou can install Python 3 and all of these packages in a few clicks with the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Anaconda is popular in Data Science and Machine Learning communities. (Use whichever tool works for you. [If you're unsure or need more context about using conda/virtualenv/poetry/pipenv, here's a very helpful guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20211226071314/https://brainsteam.co.uk/2021/04/01/opinionated-guide-to-virtualenvs/))\n\n### Cloud-based options\n\nSome options you can use from your browser:\n\n- **[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is Jupyter Notebook's official choice to [try JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try)**\n- [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) allows for real-time collaboration\n- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides \"free\" GPUs\n\nFor other options, see:\n\n- [markusschanta/awesome-jupyter, \"Hosted Notebook Solutions\"](https://github.com/markusschanta/awesome-jupyter#hosted-notebook-solutions)\n- [ml-tooling/best-of-jupyter, \"Notebook Environments\"](https://github.com/ml-tooling/best-of-jupyter)\n\n## Let's go!\n\n**[Learn how to use Jupyter Notebook](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html) (5-10 minutes).** (You can [learn by screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7FT68tcA8) instead.)\n\nNow, follow along with this brief exercise: **[An introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)**.

Like any way of creating programs faster, you can rack up [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).\n\nHere is the abstract of [Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/):\n\n> Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building complex systems quickly. This paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where possible. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.\n\nIf you're reading this guide, you should read that paper.

That's paraphrasing from some of the linked coursework in this guide \u2014 for example, Prof. Andrew Ng encourages building foundations in ML before studying DL. Perhaps you're ready for that now, or perhaps you'd like to get started soon and learn some DL in parallel to your other ML learnings.\n\nWhen you're ready to dive into Deep Learning, here are some helpful resources.\n\n* **[_Dive into Deep Learning_](https://d2l.ai/) - An interactive book about deep learning** ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en))\n  * Quickstart:\n    * [Run this book locally, using Jupyter Notebooks](https://d2l.ai/chapter_installation/index.html)\n    * [Run this book in your browser, using Google Colab](https://d2l.ai/chapter_appendix-tools-for-deep-learning/colab.html)\n  * \"The entire book is drafted in Jupyter notebooks, seamlessly integrating exposition figures, math, and interactive examples with self-contained code.\"\n  * \"You can modify the code and tune hyperparameters to get instant feedback to accumulate practical experiences in deep learning.\"\n\n<details><summary>More deep learning links</summary>\n\n* **[Prof. Andrew Ng's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mG4imMEAAAAJ&hl=en) [courses on Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)!** There five courses, as part of the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

To get good results, you or your team will need \"substantive expertise\" / \"domain knowledge.\" Learn what you can, for yourself... But you should also **collaborate with experts.** You'll have better results if you collaborate with [subject-matter experts and domain experts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-matter_expert#Domain_expert_(software)).\n\n### Machine Learning and User Experience (UX)\n\nI couldn't say it better:\n\n> **Machine learning won\u2019t figure out what problems to solve.** If you aren\u2019t aligned with a human need, you\u2019re just going to build a very powerful system to address a very small\u2014or perhaps nonexistent\u2014problem.\n\nThat quote is from [\"The UX of AI\" by Josh Lovejoy](https://design.google/library/ux-ai/). In other words, **[You Are Not The User](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/false-consensus/).** Suggested reading: [Martin Zinkevich's \"Rules of ML Engineering\", Rule #23: \"You are not a typical end user\"](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/#human_analysis_of_the_system)\n\n## Skilling up\n\nWhat are some ways one can practice?\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>One way:</strong> competitions and challenges</summary>\n\nYou need **practice.** [On Hacker News, user olympus commented to say you could use competitions to practice and evaluate yourself](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10508565). [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) and [ChaLearn](http://www.chalearn.org/) are hubs for Machine Learning competitions. (You can find more competitions [here](https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code#results-leaderboards) or [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/12-data-science-ai-competitions-to-advance-your-skills-in-2021-32e3fcb95d8c).)\n\nYou also need **understanding.** You should review what Kaggle competition winners say about their solutions, [for example, the \"No Free Hunch\" blog](http://blog.kaggle.com/). These might be over your head at first but once you're starting to understand and appreciate these, you know you're getting somewhere.\n\nCompetitions and challenges are just one way to practice! [Machine Learning isn't just about Kaggle competitions](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/19/machine-learning-isnt-kaggle-competitions).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Another way:</strong> try doing some practice studies</summary>\n\nHere's a complementary way to practice: **do practice studies.**\n\n1. **Ask a question. Start exploring some data.** The [\"most important thing in data science is the question\"](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/blob/master/01_DataScientistToolbox/03_02_whatIsData/index.Rmd#the-data-is-the-second-most-important-thing) ([Dr. Jeff T. Leek](https://github.com/jtleek)). So start with a question. Then, find [real data](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets). Analyze it. Then ...\n2. **Communicate results.** When you think you have a novel finding, ask for review. When you're still learning, ask in informal communities (some are [linked below](#some-communities-to-know-about)).\n3. **Learn from feedback.** Consider [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), it works great for some folks. (Don't pressure yourself yet though! Everybody is different, and it's good to know your learning style.)\n\nHow can you come up with interesting questions? Here's one way. Pick a day each week to [look for public datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) and write down some questions that come to mind. Also, sign up for [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural), a newsletter of interesting datasets. When a question inspires you, try exploring it with the skills you're learning.\n\nThis advice, to do practice studies and learn from review, is based on [a conversation](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning/issues/11#issuecomment-153934120) with [Dr. Randal S. Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/). Here's more advice from Olson, [quoted with permission:](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning/issues/11#issuecomment-154135498)\n\n> I think the best advice is to tell people to always present their methods clearly and to avoid over-interpreting their results. Part of being an expert is knowing that there's rarely a clear answer, especially when you're working with real data.\n\nAs you repeat this process, your practice studies will become more scientific, interesting, and focused. Also, [here's a video about the scientific method in data science.](https://101.datascience.community/2012/06/27/the-data-scientific-method/))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>More machine learning career-related links</summary>\n\n* [\"Advice on building a machine learning career and reading research papers by Prof. Andrew Ng\"](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/09/advice-building-machine-learning-career-research-papers-andrew-ng.html)\n* Some links for finding/following interesting papers/code:\n  * [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) is a popular site to follow, and it can lead you to other resources.
