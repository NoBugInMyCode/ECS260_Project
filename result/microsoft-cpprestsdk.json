We will continue to fix critical bugs and address security issues.**\n\n## Welcome!\n\nThe C++ REST SDK is a Microsoft project for cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design. This project aims to help C++ developers connect to and interact with services.  \n\n## Getting Started\n\n[![Vcpkg package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/vcpkg/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n[![Homebrew package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/homebrew/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n[![Ubuntu 18.04 package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/ubuntu_18_04/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n[![Fedora Rawhide package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/fedora_rawhide/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n[![openSUSE Tumbleweed package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/opensuse_tumbleweed/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n[![Debian Testing package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/debian_testing/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n\n[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/vclibs/cpprestsdk/_apis/build/status/Microsoft.cpprestsdk.Ubuntu)](https://dev.azure.com/vclibs/cpprestsdk/_build/latest?definitionId=1)\n\nWith [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on Windows\n```\nPS> vcpkg install cpprestsdk cpprestsdk:x64-windows\n```\nWith [apt-get](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/casablanca/2.8.0-2build2) on Debian/Ubuntu\n```\n$ sudo apt-get install libcpprest-dev\n```\nWith [dnf](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/cpprest) on Fedora\n```\n$ sudo dnf install cpprest-devel\n```\nWith [brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/cpprestsdk.rb) on OSX\n```\n$ brew install cpprestsdk\n```\nWith [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/cpprestsdk.android/) on Windows for Android\n```\nPM> Install-Package cpprestsdk.android\n```\nFor other platforms, install options, how to build from source, and more, take a look at our [Documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki).\n\nOnce you have the library, look at our [tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki/Getting-Started-Tutorial) to use the http_client. It walks through how to setup a project to use the C++ Rest SDK and make a basic Http request.\n\nTo use from CMake:\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9)\nproject(main)\n\nfind_package(cpprestsdk REQUIRED)\n\nadd_executable(main main.cpp)\ntarget_link_libraries(main PRIVATE cpprestsdk::cpprest)\n```\n\n## What's in the SDK:\n\n*   Features - HTTP client/server, JSON, URI, asynchronous streams, WebSockets client, oAuth\n*   PPL Tasks - A powerful model for composing asynchronous operations based on C++ 11 features\n*   Platforms - Windows desktop, Windows Store (UWP), Linux, OS X, Unix, iOS, and Android\n*   Support for [Visual Studio 2015 and 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with debugger visualizers\n\n## Contribute Back!\n\nIs there a feature missing that you'd like to see, or found a bug that you have a fix for? Or do you have an idea or just interest in helping out in building the library? Let us know and we'd love to work with you. For a good starting point on where we are headed and feature ideas, take a look at our [requested features and bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/issues).  \n\nBig or small we'd like to take your [contributions](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki/Make-a-contribution-and-report-issues) back to help improve the C++ Rest SDK for everyone.\n\n## Having Trouble?\n\nWe'd love to get your review score, whether good or bad, but even more than that, we want to fix your problem. If you submit your issue as a Review, we won't be able to respond to your problem and ask any follow-up questions that may be necessary. The most efficient way to do that is to open an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/issues).  \n\n### Quick Links\n\n*   [FAQ](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki/FAQ)\n*   [Documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki)\n*   [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/issues)\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
