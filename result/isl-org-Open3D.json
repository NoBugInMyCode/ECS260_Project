The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected\ndata structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly\noptimized and is set up for parallelization. We welcome contributions from\nthe open-source community.\n\n[![Ubuntu CI](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/actions/workflows/ubuntu.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Ubuntu+CI%22)\n[![macOS CI](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/actions/workflows/macos.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/actions?query=workflow%3A%22macOS+CI%22)\n[![Windows CI](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/actions/workflows/windows.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Windows+CI%22)\n\n**Core features of Open3D include:**\n\n-   3D data structures\n-   3D data processing algorithms\n-   Scene reconstruction\n-   Surface alignment\n-   3D visualization\n-   Physically based rendering (PBR)\n-   3D machine learning support with PyTorch and TensorFlow\n-   GPU acceleration for core 3D operations\n-   Available in C++ and Python\n\nHere's a brief overview of the different components of Open3D and how they fit\ntogether to enable full end to end pipelines:\n\n![Open3D_layers](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/assets/41028320/e9b8645a-a823-4d78-8310-e85207bbc3e4)\n\nFor more, please visit the [Open3D documentation](https://www.open3d.org/docs).\n\n## Python quick start\n\nPre-built pip packages support Ubuntu 20.04+, macOS 10.15+ and Windows 10+\n(64-bit) with Python 3.8-3.11.\n\n```bash\n# Install\npip install open3d       # or\npip install open3d-cpu   # Smaller CPU only wheel on x86_64 Linux (v0.17+)\n\n# Verify installation\npython -c \"import open3d as o3d; print(o3d.__version__)\"\n\n# Python API\npython -c \"import open3d as o3d; \\\n           mesh = o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh.create_sphere(); \\\n           mesh.compute_vertex_normals(); \\\n           o3d.visualization.draw(mesh, raw_mode=True)\"\n\n# Open3D CLI\nopen3d example visualization/draw\n```\n\nTo get the latest features in Open3D, install the\n[development pip package](https://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/getting_started.html#development-version-pip).\nTo compile Open3D from source, refer to\n[compiling from source](https://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html).\n\n## C++ quick start\n\nCheckout the following links to get started with Open3D C++ API\n\n-   Download Open3D binary package: [Release](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/releases) or [latest development version](https://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/getting_started.html#c)\n-   [Compiling Open3D from source](https://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html)\n-   [Open3D C++ API](https://www.open3d.org/docs/release/cpp_api.html)\n\nTo use Open3D in your C++ project, checkout the following examples\n\n-   [Find Pre-Installed Open3D Package in CMake](https://github.com/isl-org/open3d-cmake-find-package)\n-   [Use Open3D as a CMake External Project](https://github.com/isl-org/open3d-cmake-external-project)\n\n## Open3D-Viewer app\n\n<img width=\"480\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isl-org/Open3D/main/docs/_static/open3d_viewer.png\">\n\nOpen3D-Viewer is a standalone 3D viewer app available on Debian (Ubuntu), macOS\nand Windows.
