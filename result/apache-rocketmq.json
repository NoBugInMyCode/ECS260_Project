is a distributed messaging and streaming platform with low latency, high performance and reliability, trillion-level capacity and flexible scalability.**\n\n\nIt offers a variety of features:\n\n* Messaging patterns including publish/subscribe, request/reply and streaming\n* Financial grade transactional message\n* Built-in fault tolerance and high availability configuration options base on [DLedger Controller](docs/en/controller/quick_start.md)\n* Built-in message tracing capability, also support opentracing\n* Versatile big-data and streaming ecosystem integration\n* Message retroactivity by time or offset\n* Reliable FIFO and strict ordered messaging in the same queue\n* Efficient pull and push consumption model\n* Million-level message accumulation capacity in a single queue\n* Multiple messaging protocols like gRPC, MQTT, JMS and OpenMessaging\n* Flexible distributed scale-out deployment architecture\n* Lightning-fast batch message exchange system\n* Various message filter mechanics such as SQL and Tag\n* Docker images for isolated testing and cloud isolated clusters\n* Feature-rich administrative dashboard for configuration, metrics and monitoring\n* Authentication and authorization\n* Free open source connectors, for both sources and sinks\n* Lightweight real-time computing\n----------\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThis paragraph guides you through steps of installing RocketMQ in different ways.\nFor local development and testing, only one instance will be created for each component.\n\n### Run RocketMQ locally\n\nRocketMQ runs on all major operating systems and requires only a Java JDK version 8 or higher to be installed.\nTo check, run `java -version`:\n```shell\n$ java -version\njava version \"1.8.0_121\"\n```\n\nFor Windows users, click [here](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/rocketmq/5.2.0/rocketmq-all-5.2.0-bin-release.zip) to download the 5.2.0 RocketMQ binary release,\nunpack it to your local disk, such as `D:\\rocketmq`.\nFor macOS and Linux users, execute following commands:\n\n```shell\n# Download release from the Apache mirror\n$ wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/rocketmq/5.2.0/rocketmq-all-5.2.0-bin-release.zip\n\n# Unpack the release\n$ unzip rocketmq-all-5.2.0-bin-release.zip\n```\n\nPrepare a terminal and change to the extracted `bin` directory:\n```shell\n$ cd rocketmq-all-5.2.0-bin-release/bin\n```\n\n**1) Start NameServer**\n\nNameServer will be listening at `0.0.0.0:9876`, make sure that the port is not used by others on the local machine, and then do as follows.\n\nFor macOS and Linux users:\n```shell\n### start Name Server\n$ nohup sh mqnamesrv &\n\n### check whether Name Server is successfully started\n$ tail -f ~/logs/rocketmqlogs/namesrv.log\nThe Name Server boot success...\n```\n\nFor Windows users, you need set environment variables first:\n- From the desktop, right click the Computer icon.\n- Choose Properties from the context menu.\n- Click the Advanced system settings link.\n- Click Environment Variables.\n- Add Environment `ROCKETMQ_HOME=\"D:\\rocketmq\"`. \n\nThen change directory to rocketmq, type and run:\n```shell\n$ mqnamesrv.cmd\nThe Name Server boot success...\n```\n\n**2) Start Broker**\n\nFor macOS and Linux users:\n```shell\n### start Broker\n$ nohup sh bin/mqbroker -n localhost:9876 &\n\n### check whether Broker is successfully started, eg: Broker's IP is 192.168.1.2, Broker's name is broker-a\n$ tail -f ~/logs/rocketmqlogs/broker.log\nThe broker[broker-a, 192.169.1.2:10911] boot success...\n```\n\nFor Windows users:\n```shell\n$ mqbroker.cmd -n localhost:9876\nThe broker[broker-a, 192.169.1.2:10911] boot success...\n```\n\n### Run RocketMQ in Docker\n\nYou can run RocketMQ on your own machine within Docker containers,\n`host` network will be used to expose listening port in the container.\n\n**1) Start NameServer**\n\n```shell\n$ docker run -it --net=host apache/rocketmq ./mqnamesrv\n```\n\n**2) Start Broker**\n\n```shell\n$ docker run -it --net=host --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/store,target=/home/rocketmq/store apache/rocketmq ./mqbroker -n localhost:9876\n```\n\n### Run RocketMQ in Kubernetes\n\nYou can also run a RocketMQ cluster within a Kubernetes cluster using [RocketMQ Operator](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-operator).\nBefore your operations, make sure that `kubectl` and related kubeconfig file installed on your machine.\n\n**1) Install CRDs**\n```shell\n### install CRDs\n$ git clone https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-operator\n$ cd rocketmq-operator && make deploy\n\n### check whether CRDs is successfully installed\n$ kubectl get crd | grep rocketmq.apache.org\nbrokers.rocketmq.apache.org                 2022-05-12T09:23:18Z\nconsoles.rocketmq.apache.org                2022-05-12T09:23:19Z\nnameservices.rocketmq.apache.org            2022-05-12T09:23:18Z\ntopictransfers.rocketmq.apache.org          2022-05-12T09:23:19Z\n\n### check whether operator is running\n$ kubectl get pods | grep rocketmq-operator\nrocketmq-operator-6f65c77c49-8hwmj   1/1     Running   0          93s\n```\n\n**2) Create Cluster Instance**\n```shell\n### create RocketMQ cluster resource\n$ cd example && kubectl create -f rocketmq_v1alpha1_rocketmq_cluster.yaml\n\n### check whether cluster resources is running\n$ kubectl get sts\nNAME                 READY   AGE\nbroker-0-master      1/1     107m\nbroker-0-replica-1   1/1     107m\nname-service         1/1     107m\n```\n\n---\n## Apache RocketMQ Community\n* [RocketMQ Streams](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-streams): A lightweight
