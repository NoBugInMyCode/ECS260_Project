It does not impose a specific development\nphilosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the\nway that you want.\n\n- [Homepage](https://html5boilerplate.com/)\n- [Source Code](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)\n\n## About This Repository\n\nThis repository is where HTML5-Boilerplate is authored. Some of the tools,\nfiles and processes that you see here are solely for the _production_ of\nHTML5 Boilerplate and are not _part_ of HTML5 Boilerplate. For one example, the\n[gulpfile.mjs](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/main/gulpfile.mjs)\nscript is used to _build_ the project. It's not part of the project itself.\n\nThe project we publish is represented by the contents of the `/dist/`\nfolder. Everything else in this repository is used to author the project.\n\nThink of it this way, in the same way that you don't clone [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core)\nto create a Vue.js app, you don't need to clone this repository to start a new\nsite or app based on HTML5 Boilerplate.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a quick start template to build a website or\napplication, look at the options in the\n[Quick Start](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate#quick-start) section of this document.\n\nIf you want to help us _improve_ HTML5 Boilerplate then you can start with the documentation [here](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), which includes steps to clone this repo in order to get it set up for development.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nChoose one of the following options:\n\n- Using the [create-html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/create-html5-boilerplate)\n  script, instantly fetch the latest npm published package (or any version\n  available on npm) with `npx`, `npm init` or `yarn create` without having to\n  install any dependencies. Running the following `npx` command installs the\n  latest version into a folder called `new-site`\n\n  ```bash\n  npx create-html5-boilerplate new-site\n  cd new-site\n  npm install\n  npm run start\n  ```\n\n- Using our new [Template Repository](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate-template)\n  create a new GitHub repository based on the latest code from the main branch of HTML5\n  Boilerplate.\n\n- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install html5-boilerplate`\n  or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add html5-boilerplate`. The resulting\n  `node_modules/html5-boilerplate/dist` folder represents the latest version of\n  the project for end users. Depending on what you want to use and how you want\n  to use it, you may have to copy and paste the contents of that folder into\n  your project directory.\n\n- Download the latest stable release from\n  [here](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/releases/download/v9.0.0/html5-boilerplate_v9.0.0.zip). This zip file is a\n  snapshot of the `dist` folder. On Windows, Mac and from the file manager on\n  Linux unzipping this folder will output to a folder named something like\n  `html5-boilerplate_v9.0.0`. From the command-line, you will need to create a\n  folder and unzip the contents into that folder.\n\n  ```bash\n  mkdir html5-boilerplate\n  unzip html5-boilerplate*.zip -d html5-boilerplate\n  ```\n\n## Features\n\n- A finely-tuned starter template: Reap the benefits of 10 years of analysis,\n  research and experimentation by over 200 contributors.\n- Designed with progressive enhancement in mind.\n- Includes:\n  - Placeholder Open Graph elements and attributes.\n  - An example package.json file with [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/) commands\n    built in to jumpstart application development.\n  - Placeholder CSS Media Queries.\n  - Useful CSS helper classes.\n  - Default print styles, performance optimized.\n  - \"Delete-key friendly.\" Easy to strip out parts you don't need.\n  - Extensive documentation.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nHTML5-Boilerplate supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers.\n\nCheck the `default` configuration from [Browserslist](https://browsersl.ist/#q=defaults)\nfor more details on browsers and versions covered.\n\n## Documentation\n\nTake a look at the [documentation table of contents](docs/TOC.md). This\ndocumentation is bundled with the project which makes it available for offline\nreading and provides a useful starting point for any documentation you want to\nwrite about your project.\n\n## Contributing\n\nHundreds of developers have helped to make the HTML5 Boilerplate. Anyone is\nwelcome to [contribute](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). However, if you decide to get\ninvolved, please take a moment to review the [guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md):\n\n- [Bug reports](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bugs)\n- [Feature requests](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#features)\n- [Pull requests](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)\n\n## License\n\nThe code is available under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).\n",
