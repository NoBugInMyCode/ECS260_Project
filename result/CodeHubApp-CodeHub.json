The project is built on [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/), a free C# framework for iOS applications. You'll need to download this to build the project.  \n\n1. Fork it!\n2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`\n3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`\n4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`\n5. Submit a pull request :D\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### I Can't Find My Organization\n\nCodeHub can see all organizations *if they are granted access*. GitHub, by default, disables [third-party access](https://help.github.com/articles/about-third-party-application-restrictions/) for new organizations. Because of this, CodeHub has no knowledge that those organizations even exist. GitHub keeps that information from the app. There are several ways to correct this. If you own the organization follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/enabling-third-party-application-restrictions-for-your-organization/). If you do not own the organization you can request access for CodeHub by following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/requesting-organization-approval-for-third-party-applications/).\n\n### I Can't Find My Repository\n\nIf these repositories belong to an organization then your problem is most likely due to the issue above. Please consult it for a remedy.\n\nIf they do not belong to an organization then something is not right. Please file a ticket.'\n\n### I need help!\n\nTry the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/thedillonb/CodeHub) channel.\n\n## Credits\n\nA lot of thanks to many who contribute to open-source projects.
