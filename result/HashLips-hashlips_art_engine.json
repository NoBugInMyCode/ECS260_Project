        "readme": "# Welcome to HashLips \ud83d\udc44\n\n![](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine/blob/main/logo.png)\n\nAll the code in these repos was created and explained by HashLips on the main YouTube channel.\n\nTo find out more please visit:\n\n[\ud83d\udcfa YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1LV4_VQGBJHTJjEWUmy8nA)\n\n[\ud83d\udc44 Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qh6MWhMJDN)\n\n[\ud83d\udcac Telegram](https://t.me/hashlipsnft)\n\n[\ud83d\udc26 Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashlipsnft)\n\n[\u2139\ufe0f Website](https://hashlips.online/HashLips)\n\n# HashLips Art Engine \ud83d\udd25\n\n![](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine/blob/main/banner.png)\n\nCreate generative art by using the canvas api and node js. Before you use the generation engine, make sure you have node.js(v10.18.0) installed.\n\n## Installation \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\n\nIf you are cloning the project then run this first, otherwise you can download the source code on the release page and skip this step.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine.git\n```\n\nGo to the root of your folder and run this command if you have yarn installed.\n\n```sh\nyarn install\n```\n\nAlternatively you can run this command if you have node installed.\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Usage \u2139\ufe0f\n\nCreate your different layers as folders in the 'layers' directory, and add all the layer assets in these directories. You can name the assets anything as long as it has a rarity weight attached in the file name like so: `example element#70.png`. You can optionally change the delimiter `#` to anything you would like to use in the variable `rarityDelimiter` in the `src/config.js` file.\n\nOnce you have all your layers, go into `src/config.js` and update the `layerConfigurations` objects `layersOrder` array to be your layer folders name in order of the back layer to the front layer.\n\n_Example:_ If you were creating a portrait design, you might have a background, then a head, a mouth, eyes, eyewear, and then headwear, so your `layersOrder` would look something like this:\n\n```js\nconst layerConfigurations = [\n  {\n    growEditionSizeTo: 100,\n    layersOrder: [\n      { name: \"Head\" },\n      { name: \"Mouth\" },\n      { name: \"Eyes\" },\n      { name: \"Eyeswear\" },\n      { name: \"Headwear\" },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n```\n\nThe `name` of each layer object represents the name of the folder (in `/layers/`) that the images reside in.\n\nOptionally you can now add multiple different `layerConfigurations` to your collection. Each configuration can be unique and have different layer orders, use the same layers or introduce new ones. This gives the artist flexibility when it comes to fine tuning their collections to their needs.\n\n_Example:_ If you were creating a portrait design, you might have a background, then a head, a mouth, eyes, eyewear, and then headwear and you want to create a new race or just simple re-order the layers or even introduce new layers, then you're `layerConfigurations` and `layersOrder` would look something like this:\n\n```js\nconst layerConfigurations = [\n  {\n    // Creates up to 50 artworks\n    growEditionSizeTo: 50,\n    layersOrder: [\n      { name: \"Background\" },\n      { name: \"Head\" },\n      { name: \"Mouth\" },\n      { name: \"Eyes\" },\n      { name: \"Eyeswear\" },\n      { name: \"Headwear\" },\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    // Creates an additional 100 artworks\n    growEditionSizeTo: 150,\n    layersOrder: [\n      { name: \"Background\" },\n      { name: \"Head\" },\n      { name: \"Eyes\" },\n      { name: \"Mouth\" },\n      { name: \"Eyeswear\" },\n      { name: \"Headwear\" },\n      { name: \"AlienHeadwear\" },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n```\n\nUpdate your `format` size, ie the outputted image size, and the `growEditionSizeTo` on each `layerConfigurations` object, which is the amount of variation outputted.\n\nYou can mix up the `layerConfigurations` order on how the images are saved by setting the variable `shuffleLayerConfigurations` in the `config.js` file to true. It is false by default and will save all images in numerical order.\n\nIf you want to have logs to debug and see what is happening when you generate images you can set the variable `debugLogs` in the `config.js` file to true. It is false by default, so you will only see general logs.\n\nIf you want to play around with different blending modes, you can add a `blend: MODE.colorBurn` field to the layersOrder `options` object.\n\nIf you need a layers to have a different opacity then you can add the `opacity: 0.7` field to the layersOrder `options` object as well.\n\nIf you want to have a layer _ignored_ in the DNA uniqueness check, you can set `bypassDNA: true` in the `options` object. This has the effect of making sure the rest of the traits are unique while not considering the `Background` Layers as traits, for example. The layers _are_ included in the final image.\n\nTo use a different metadata attribute name you can add the `displayName: \"Awesome Eye Color\"` to the `options` object. All options are optional and can be addes on the same layer if you want to.\n\nHere is an example on how you can play around with both filter fields:\n\n```js\nconst layerConfigurations = [\n  {\n    growEditionSizeTo: 5,\n    layersOrder: [\n      { name: \"Background\" , {\n        options: {\n          bypassDNA: false;\n        }\n      }},\n      { name: \"Eyeball\" },\n      {\n        name: \"Eye color\",\n        options: {\n          blend: MODE.destinationIn,\n          opacity: 0.2,\n          displayName: \"Awesome Eye Color\",\n        },\n      },\n      { name: \"Iris\" },\n      { name: \"Shine\" },\n      { name: \"Bottom lid\", options: { blend: MODE.overlay, opacity: 0.7 } },\n      { name: \"Top lid\" },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n```\n\nHere is a list of the different blending modes that you can optionally use.\n\n```js\nconst MODE = {\n  sourceOver: \"source-over\",\n  sourceIn: \"source-in\",\n  sourceOut: \"source-out\",\n  sourceAtop: \"source-out\",\n  destinationOver: \"destination-over\",\n  destinationIn: \"destination-in\",\n  destinationOut: \"destination-out\",\n  destinationAtop: \"destination-atop\",\n  lighter: \"lighter\",\n  copy: \"copy\",\n  xor: \"xor\",\n  multiply: \"multiply\",\n  screen: \"screen\",\n  overlay: \"overlay\",\n  darken: \"darken\",\n  lighten: \"lighten\",\n  colorDodge: \"color-dodge\",\n  colorBurn: \"color-burn\",\n  hardLight: \"hard-light\",\n  softLight: \"soft-light\",\n  difference: \"difference\",\n  exclusion: \"exclusion\",\n  hue: \"hue\",\n  saturation: \"saturation\",\n  color: \"color\",\n  luminosity: \"luminosity\",\n};\n```\n\nWhen you are ready, run the following command and your outputted art will be in the `build/images` directory and the json in the `build/json` directory:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nnode index.js\n```\n\nThe program will output all the images in the `build/images` directory along with the metadata files in the `build/json` directory. Each collection will have a `_metadata.json` file that consists of all the metadata in the collection inside the `build/json` directory. The `build/json` folder also will contain all the single json files that represent each image file. The single json file of a image will look something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dna\": \"d956cdf4e460508b5ff90c21974124f68d6edc34\",\n  \"name\": \"#1\",\n  \"description\": \"This is the description of your NFT project\",\n  \"image\": \"https://hashlips/nft/1.png\",\n  \"edition\": 1,\n  \"date\": 1731990799975,\n  \"attributes\": [\n    { \"trait_type\": \"Background\", \"value\": \"Black\" },\n    { \"trait_type\": \"Eyeball\", \"value\": \"Red\" },\n    { \"trait_type\": \"Eye color\", \"value\": \"Yellow\" },\n    { \"trait_type\": \"Iris\", \"value\": \"Small\" },\n    { \"trait_type\": \"Shine\", \"value\": \"Shapes\" },\n    { \"trait_type\": \"Bottom lid\", \"value\": \"Low\" },\n    { \"trait_type\": \"Top lid\", \"value\": \"Middle\" }\n  ],\n  \"compiler\": \"HashLips Art Engine\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can also add extra metadata to each metadata file by adding your extra items, (key: value) pairs to the `extraMetadata` object variable in the `config.js` file.\n\n```js\nconst extraMetadata = {\n  creator: \"Daniel Eugene Botha\",\n};\n```\n\nIf you don't need extra metadata, simply leave the object empty. It is empty by default.\n\n```js\nconst extraMetadata = {};\n```\n\nThat's it, you're done.\n\n## Utils\n\n### Updating baseUri for IPFS and description\n\nYou might possibly want to update the baseUri and description after you have ran your collection. To update the baseUri and description simply run:\n\n```sh\nnpm run update_info\n```\n\n### Generate a preview image\n\nCreate a preview image collage of your collection, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm run preview\n```\n\n### Generate pixelated images from collection\n\nIn order to convert images into pixelated images you would need a list of images that you want to convert. So run the generator first.\n\nThen simply run this command:\n\n```sh\nnpm run pixelate\n```\n\nAll your images will be outputted in the `/build/pixel_images` directory.\nIf you want to change the ratio of the pixelation then you can update the ratio property on the `pixelFormat` object in the `src/config.js` file. The lower the number on the left, the more pixelated the image will be.\n\n```js\nconst pixelFormat = {\n  ratio: 5 / 128,\n};\n```\n\n### Generate GIF images from collection\n\nIn order to export gifs based on the layers created, you just need to set the export on the `gif` object in the `src/config.js` file to `true`. You can also play around with the `repeat`, `quality` and the `delay` of the exported gif.\n\nSetting the `repeat: -1` will produce a one time render and `repeat: 0` will loop forever.\n\n```js\nconst gif = {\n  export: true,\n  repeat: 0,\n  quality: 100,\n  delay: 500,\n};\n```\n\n### Printing rarity data (Experimental feature)\n\nTo see the percentages of each attribute across your collection, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm run rarity\n```\n\nThe output will look something like this:\n\n```sh\nTrait type: Top lid\n{\n  trait: 'High',\n  chance: '30',\n  occurrence: '3 in 20 editions (15.00 %)'\n}\n{\n  trait: 'Low',\n  chance: '20',\n  occurrence: '3 in 20 editions (15.00 %)'\n}\n{\n  trait: 'Middle',\n  chance: '50',\n  occurrence: '14 in 20 editions (70.00 %)'\n}\n```\n\nHope you create some awesome artworks with this code \ud83d\udc44\n",
