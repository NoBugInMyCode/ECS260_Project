It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the `Python Standard Library <http://docs.python.org/library/>`_.\n\n* **Routing:** Requests to function-call mapping with support for clean and dynamic URLs.\n* **Templates:** Fast `built-in template engine <http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#tutorial-templates>`_ and support for mako_, jinja2_ and cheetah_ templates.\n* **Utilities:** Convenient access to form data, file uploads, cookies, headers and other HTTP features.\n* **Server:** Built-in development server and ready-to-use adapters for a wide range of WSGI_ capable HTTP server (e.g. gunicorn_, paste_ or cheroot_).\n\n\nHomepage and documentation: http://bottlepy.org\n\n\nExample: \"Hello World\" in a bottle\n----------------------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  from bottle import route, run, template\n\n  @route('/hello/<name>')\n  def index(name):\n      return template('<b>Hello {{name}}</b>!', name=name)\n\n  run(host='localhost', port=8080)\n\nRun this script or paste it into a Python console, then point your browser to `<http://localhost:8080/hello/world>`_. That's it.\n\n\nDownload and Install\n--------------------\n\n.. __: https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/raw/master/bottle.py\n\nInstall the latest stable release with ``pip install bottle`` or download `bottle.py`__ (unstable) into your project directory.
