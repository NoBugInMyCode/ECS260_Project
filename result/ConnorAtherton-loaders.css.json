Create another file in `src/animations`\nand load it in `src/loader.scss`.\n\nIn a separate tab run `gulp --require coffee-script/register`. Open `demo/demo.html`\nin a browser to see your animation running.\n\n### Further research\n\n- http://www.paulirish.com/2012/why-moving-elements-with-translate-is-better-than-posabs-topleft/\n- http://aerotwist.com/blog/pixels-are-expensive/\n- http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/\n- http://frontendbabel.info/articles/webpage-rendering-101/\n\n### Inspired by loaders.css\n\nA few other folks have taken loaders and ported them elsewhere.\n\n- **React** - [Jon Jaques](https://github.com/jonjaques) built a React demo you can check out [here](https://github.com/jonjaques/react-loaders)\n- **Vue** - [Kirill Khoroshilov](https://github.com/Hokid) loaders wrapped into components [vue-loaders](https://github.com/Hokid/vue-loaders)\n- **Angular** - [the-corman](https://github.com/the-cormoran/angular-loaders) created some directives for angular, as did [Masadow](https://github.com/Masadow) in [this pr](https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/loaders.css/pull/50)\n- **Ember** - [Stanislav Romanov](https://github.com/kaermorchen) created an Ember addon [ember-cli-loaders](https://github.com/kaermorchen/ember-cli-loaders) for using Loaders.css in Ember applications\n- **iOS** - [ninjaprox](https://github.com/ninjaprox/NVActivityIndicatorView) and [ontovnik](https://github.com/gontovnik/DGActivityIndicatorView)\n- **Android** - [Jack Wang](https://github.com/81813780/AVLoadingIndicatorView) created a library and [technofreaky](https://github.com/technofreaky/Loaders.CSS-Android-App) created an app\n\n### Licence\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Connor Atherton\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
