It provides:\n\n- A [linter][lint_usage] that enforces good API design choices and structure.\n- A [breaking change detector][breaking_tutorial] that enforces compatibility at the source code or wire level.\n- A [generator][generate_usage] that invokes your plugins based on configurable [templates][templates].\n- A [formatter][format_usage] that formats your Protobuf files in accordance with industry standards.\n- Integration with the [Buf Schema Registry][bsr], including full dependency management.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Homebrew\n\nYou can install `buf` using [Homebrew][brew] (macOS or Linux):\n\n```sh\nbrew install bufbuild/buf/buf\n```\n\nThis installs:\n\n- The `buf`, [`protoc-gen-buf-breaking`][breaking], and [`protoc-gen-buf-lint`][lint] binaries\n- Shell completion scripts for [Bash], [Fish], [Powershell], and [zsh]\n\n### Other methods\n\nFor other installation methods, see our [official documentation][install], which covers:\n\n- Installing `buf` via [npm]\n- Installing `buf` on [Windows]\n- Using `buf` as a [Docker image][docker]\n- Installing as a [binary], from a [tarball], and from [source] through [GitHub Releases][releases]\n- [Verifying] releases using a [minisign] public key\n\n\n## Usage\n\nBuf's help interface provides summaries for commands and flags:\n\n```sh\nbuf --help\n```\n\nFor more comprehensive usage information, consult Buf's [documentation][docs], especially these guides:\n\n* [`buf breaking`][breaking_tutorial]\n* [`buf build`][build_usage]\n* [`buf generate`][generate_usage]\n* [`buf lint`][lint_usage]\n* [`buf format`][format_usage]\n* [`buf registry`][bsr_usage] (for using the [BSR])\n\n## CLI breaking change policy\n\nWe will never make breaking changes within a given major version of the CLI. After `buf` reached v1.0, you can expect no breaking changes until v2.0. But as we have no plans to ever release a v2.0, we will likely never break the `buf` CLI.\n\n> This breaking change policy does _not_ apply to commands behind the `buf beta` gate, and you should expect breaking changes to commands like `buf beta registry`. The policy does go into effect, however, when those commands or flags are elevated out of beta.\n\n## Our goals for Protobuf\n\n[Buf]'s goal is to replace the current paradigm of API development, centered around REST/JSON, with a **schema-driven** paradigm. Defining APIs using an [IDL] provides numerous benefits over REST/JSON, and [Protobuf] is by far the most stable and widely adopted IDL in the industry. We've chosen to build on this widely trusted foundation rather than creating a new IDL from scratch.\n\nBut despite its technical merits, actually _using_ Protobuf has long been more challenging than it needs to be. The Buf CLI and the [BSR](#the-buf-schema-registry) are the cornerstones of our effort to change that for good and to make Protobuf reliable and easy to use for service owners and clients alike\u2014in other words, to create a **modern Protobuf ecosystem**.\n\nWhile we intend to incrementally improve on the `buf` CLI and the [BSR](#the-buf-schema-registry), we're confident that the basic groundwork for such an ecosystem is _already_ in place.\n\n## The Buf Schema Registry\n\nThe [Buf Schema Registry][bsr] (BSR) is a SaaS platform for managing your Protobuf APIs. It provides a centralized registry and a single source of truth for all of your Protobuf assets, including not just your `.proto` files but also [remote plugins][bsr_plugins]. Although the BSR provides an intuitive browser UI, `buf` enables you to perform most BSR-related tasks from the command line, such as [pushing] Protobuf sources to the registry and managing [users] and [repositories]. \n\n> The BSR is not required to use `buf`. We've made the core [features] of the `buf` CLI available to _all_ Protobuf users.\n\n## More advanced CLI features\n\nWhile `buf`'s [core features][features] should cover most use cases, we've included some more advanced features to cover edge cases:\n\n* **Automatic file discovery**. Buf walks your file tree and builds your `.proto` files in accordance with your supplied [build configuration][build_config], which means that you no longer need to manually specify `--proto_paths`. You can still, however, specify `.proto` files manually through CLI flags in cases where file discovery needs to be disabled.\n* **Fine-grained rule configuration** for [linting][lint_rules] and [breaking changes][breaking_rules]. While we do have recommended defaults, you can always select the exact set of rules that your use case requires, with [40 lint rules][lint_rules] and [53 breaking change rules][breaking_rules] available.\n* **Configurable error formats** for CLI output. `buf` outputs information in `file:line:column:message` form by default for each lint error and breaking change it encounters, but you can also select JSON, MSVS, JUnit, and Github Actions output.\n* **Editor integration** driven by `buf`'s granular error output. We currently provide linting integrations for both [Vim and Visual Studio Code][ide] and [JetBrains IDEs][jetbrains] like IntelliJ and GoLand, but we plan to support other editors such as Emacs in the future.\n* **Universal Input targeting**. Buf enables you to perform actions like linting and breaking change detection not just against local `.proto` files but also against a broad range of other [Inputs], such as tarballs and ZIP files, remote Git repositories, and pre-built [image][images] files.\n* **Speed**. Buf's internal Protobuf [compiler] compiles your Protobuf sources using all available cores without compromising deterministic output, which is considerably faster than `protoc`. This allows for near-instantaneous feedback, which is of special importance for features like [editor integration][ide].\n\n## Next steps\n\nOnce you've installed `buf`, we recommend completing the [CLI tutorial][cli-tutorial], which provides a broad but hands-on overview of the core functionality of the CLI. The tour takes about 10 minutes to complete.\n\nAfter completing the tour, check out the remainder of the [docs] for your specific areas of interest.\n\n## Community\n\nFor help and discussion around Protobuf, best practices, and more, join us on [Slack][badges_slack].\n\nFor updates on the Buf CLI, [follow this repo on GitHub][repo].\n\nFor feature requests, bugs, or technical questions, email us at [dev@buf.build][email_dev].
