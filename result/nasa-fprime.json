Originally developed at the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), F\u00b4 has been successfully deployed on [several space applications](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/projects.html). It is tailored but not limited to small-scale spaceflight systems such as CubeSats, SmallSats, and instruments.\n\n**Please Visit the F\u00b4 Website:** [https://fprime.jpl.gov/](https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/) for more information.\n\n\n## What does F\u00b4 provide\n\n- An architecture that decomposes flight software into discrete components with well-defined interfaces\n- A C++ framework that provides core capabilities such as message queues and threads\n- Modeling tools for specifying components and connections and automatically generating code\n- A growing collection of ready-to-use components\n- Testing tools for testing flight software at the unit and integration levels.\n\nLearn more about [F\u00b4 key features](https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/).\n\n\n## System Requirements\n\n1. Linux, Windows with WSL, or macOS operating system\n2. [git](https://git-scm.com/)\n3. [CMake 3.16+](https://cmake.org/download/). CLI tool must be available on the system path.\n4. [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) or [GNU C and C++ compilers](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (e.g. gcc and g++)\n5. [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), and [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo get started with F\u00b4, install the F\u00b4 bootstrapping tool with:\n```\npip install fprime-bootstrap\n```\n\nThen, create a new project with:\n```\nfprime-bootstrap project\n```\n\nSee the [HelloWorld Tutorial](https://fprime-community.github.io/fprime-tutorial-hello-world/) to guide you through all the steps of developing an F\u00b4 project.\n\nNew users are encouraged to read through the [User Guide](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/UsersGuide/guide.html) and explore the [other tutorials](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/README.html).\n\n\n## Getting Help\n\n### Discussions\nTo ask questions, discuss improvements, and ask for help please use the project's [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/discussions).\n### Bug reports\nTo report bugs and issues, [open an issue here](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues).\n### Community\nThe [F\u00b4 Community](https://github.com/fprime-community) GitHub Organization contains third party contributions, more documentation of flight software development, and additional resources.\n\n\n## Resources\n- [User Guide](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/UsersGuide/guide.html)\n- [Tutorials](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/README.html)\n- [Discussions](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/discussions)\n- [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues)\n- [F\u00b4 Community](https://github.com/fprime-community)\n\n\n## Release Notes\n\nThe version history and artifacts associated with the project can be found at [Releases](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/releases).\n",
