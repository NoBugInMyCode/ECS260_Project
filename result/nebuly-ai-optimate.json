Although the source code is still available in the Git history, there will be no additional updates or official support.\n\n**[About Nebuly]**\n\nOur team is fully committed on creating the best user-experience platform for LLMs so that companies can understand user behavior at scale when interacting with their LLM-based products. \n- To learn more on how to get started, visit our [official documentation](https://docs.nebuly.com/welcome/overview)\n- If you need enterprise support, please contact us [here](https://www.nebuly.com/nebuly-book-a-demo)\n\n**[About optimate]**\n\nWe have open-sourced a couple of internal projects to the community, but we are not currently maintaining them. Optimate is a collection of libraries designed to help you optimize your AI models. It is an open-source project developed by Nebuly AI but is **not actively maintained**.\n\nThe tools available to assist you in your optimization are:\n\n\u2705 [Speedster](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/optimate/tree/main/optimization/speedster): reduce inference costs by leveraging SOTA optimization techniques that best couple your AI models with the underlying hardware (GPUs and CPUs)\n\n\u2705 [Nos](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nos): reduce infrastructure costs by leveraging real-time dynamic partitioning and elastic quotas to maximize the utilization of your Kubernetes GPU cluster\n\n\u2705 [ChatLLaMA](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/optimate/tree/main/optimization/chatllama): reduce hardware and data costs by leveraging fine-tuning optimization techniques and RLHF alignment\n",
