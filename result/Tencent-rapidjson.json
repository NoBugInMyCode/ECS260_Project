It was inspired by [RapidXml](http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/).\n\n* RapidJSON is **small** but **complete**. It supports both SAX and DOM style API. The SAX parser is only a half thousand lines of code.\n\n* RapidJSON is **fast**. Its performance can be comparable to `strlen()`. It also optionally supports SSE2/SSE4.2 for acceleration.\n\n* RapidJSON is **self-contained** and **header-only**. It does not depend on external libraries such as BOOST. It even does not depend on STL.\n\n* RapidJSON is **memory-friendly**. Each JSON value occupies exactly 16 bytes for most 32/64-bit machines (excluding text string). By default it uses a fast memory allocator, and the parser allocates memory compactly during parsing.\n\n* RapidJSON is **Unicode-friendly**. It supports UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 (LE & BE), and their detection, validation and transcoding internally. For example, you can read a UTF-8 file and let RapidJSON transcode the JSON strings into UTF-16 in the DOM. It also supports surrogates and \"\\u0000\" (null character).\n\nMore features can be read [here](doc/features.md).\n\nJSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is a light-weight data exchange format. RapidJSON should be in full compliance with RFC7159/ECMA-404, with optional support of relaxed syntax. More information about JSON can be obtained at\n* [Introducing JSON](http://json.org/)\n* [RFC7159: The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159)\n* [Standard ECMA-404: The JSON Data Interchange Format](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm)\n\n## Highlights in v1.1 (2016-8-25)\n\n* Added [JSON Pointer](doc/pointer.md)\n* Added [JSON Schema](doc/schema.md)\n* Added [relaxed JSON syntax](doc/dom.md) (comment, trailing comma, NaN/Infinity)\n* Iterating array/object with [C++11 Range-based for loop](doc/tutorial.md)\n* Reduce memory overhead of each `Value` from 24 bytes to 16 bytes in x86-64 architecture.\n\nFor other changes please refer to [change log](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nRapidJSON is cross-platform. Some platform/compiler combinations which have been tested are shown as follows.\n* Visual C++ 2008/2010/2013 on Windows (32/64-bit)\n* GNU C++ 3.8.x on Cygwin\n* Clang 3.4 on Mac OS X (32/64-bit) and iOS\n* Clang 3.4 on Android NDK\n\nUsers can build and run the unit tests on their platform/compiler.\n\n## Installation\n\nRapidJSON is a header-only C++ library. Just copy the `include/rapidjson` folder to system or project's include path.\n\nAlternatively, if you are using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager you can download and install rapidjson with CMake integration in a single command:\n* vcpkg install rapidjson\n\nRapidJSON uses following software as its dependencies:\n* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as a general build tool\n* (optional) [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) to build documentation\n* (optional) [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit and performance testing\n\nTo generate user documentation and run tests please proceed with the steps below:\n\n1. Execute `git submodule update --init` to get the files of thirdparty submodules (google test).\n2. Create directory called `build` in rapidjson source directory.\n3. Change to `build` directory and run `cmake ..` command to configure your build. Windows users can do the same with cmake-gui application.\n4. On Windows, build the solution found in the build directory. On Linux, run `make` from the build directory.\n\nOn successful build you will find compiled test and example binaries in `bin`\ndirectory. The generated documentation will be available in `doc/html`\ndirectory of the build tree. To run tests after finished build please run `make\ntest` or `ctest` from your build tree. You can get detailed output using `ctest\n-V` command.\n\nIt is possible to install library system-wide by running `make install` command\nfrom the build tree with administrative privileges. This will install all files\naccording to system preferences.  Once RapidJSON is installed, it is possible\nto use it from other CMake projects by adding `find_package(RapidJSON)` line to\nyour CMakeLists.txt.\n\n## Usage at a glance\n\nThis simple example parses a JSON string into a document (DOM), make a simple modification of the DOM, and finally stringify the DOM to a JSON string.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~cpp\n// rapidjson/example/simpledom/simpledom.cpp`\n#include \"rapidjson/document.h\"\n#include \"rapidjson/writer.h\"\n#include \"rapidjson/stringbuffer.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace rapidjson;\n\nint main() {\n    // 1. Parse a JSON string into DOM.\n    const char* json = \"{\\\"project\\\":\\\"rapidjson\\\",\\\"stars\\\":10}\";\n    Document d;\n    d.Parse(json);\n\n    // 2. Modify it by DOM.\n    Value& s = d[\"stars\"];\n    s.SetInt(s.GetInt() + 1);\n\n    // 3. Stringify the DOM\n    StringBuffer buffer;\n    Writer<StringBuffer> writer(buffer);\n    d.Accept(writer);\n\n    // Output {\"project\":\"rapidjson\",\"stars\":11}\n    std::cout << buffer.GetString() << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNote that this example did not handle potential errors.\n\nThe following diagram shows the process.\n\n![simpledom](doc/diagram/simpledom.png)\n\nMore [examples](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/tree/master/example) are available:\n\n* DOM API\n  * [tutorial](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/blob/master/example/tutorial/tutorial.cpp): Basic usage of DOM API.\n\n* SAX API\n  * [simplereader](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/blob/master/example/simplereader/simplereader.cpp): Dumps all SAX events while parsing a JSON by `Reader`.\n  * [condense](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/blob/master/example/condense/condense.cpp): A command line tool to rewrite a JSON, with all whitespaces removed.\n  * [pretty](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/blob/master/example/pretty/pretty.cpp): A command line tool to rewrite a JSON with indents and newlines by `PrettyWriter`.\n  * [capitalize](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/blob/master/example/capitalize/capitalize.cpp): A command line tool to capitalize strings in JSON.\n  * [messagereader](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/blob/master/example/messagereader/messagereader.cpp): Parse a JSON message with SAX API.\n  * [serialize](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/blob/master/example/serialize/serialize.cpp): Serialize a C++ object into JSON with SAX API.\n  * [jsonx](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/blob/master/example/jsonx/jsonx.cpp): Implements a `JsonxWriter` which stringify SAX events into [JSONx](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS9H2Y_7.1.0/com.ibm.dp.doc/json_jsonx.html) (a kind of XML) format.
