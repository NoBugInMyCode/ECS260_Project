Built with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron).*\n\n> **\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f NO LONGER IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT | \u9879\u76ee\u4e0d\u518d\u7ef4\u62a4 \u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f** \n> \n> Thanks for supporting this project for **1000** days since Feb 16, 2016. \n> \n> It started with the idea to make WeChat better on MacOS when the official support was abscent. It was de facto dead when Tencent rolled out a new WeChat and started to block other third-party clients. For me, it's no longer worthwhile to hack a lot to accomplish little. Hope this project had been helpful to you in any way. You're welcome to fork or make copies with a reference.
