It doesn't rely on any JavaScript frameworks or\nlibraries. Optimized for cross-device use, gracefully degrades in older\nbrowsers, and offers an experience that is accessible from the get-go.\n\n> ### Limited support\n\n> Material Design Lite is now in limited support, with development having moved to the\n> [Material Components for the web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) repository.\n\n> No further development is taking place in MDL by the core team, but we are happy to review PRs, fix critical bugs and\n> push out new releases. No breaking changes will be accepted.\n\n## Use MDL on your site?\n\n**This document is targeted at developers that will contribute to or compile\nMDL. If you are looking to use MDL on your website or web app please head to\n[getmdl.io](http://getmdl.io).**\n\n## Browser Support\n\n\n| IE9 | IE10 | IE11 | Chrome | Opera | Firefox | Safari | Chrome (Android) | Mobile Safari |\n|-----|------|------|--------|-------|---------|--------|------------------|---------------|\n| B   | A    | A    | A      | A     | A       | A      | A                | A             |\n\nA-grade browsers are fully supported. B-grade browsers will gracefully degrade\nto our CSS-only experience.\n\n### Download / Clone\n\nClone the repo using Git:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/google/material-design-lite.git\n```\n\nAlternatively you can [download](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/archive/master.zip)\nthis repository.\n\nWindows users, if you have trouble compiling due to line endings then make sure\nyou configure git to checkout the repository with `lf` (unix) line endings. This\ncan be achieved by setting `core.eol`.\n\n```bash\ngit config core.eol lf\ngit config core.autocrlf input\ngit rm --cached -r .\ngit reset --hard\n```\n\n> Remember, the master branch is considered unstable. Do not use this in\nproduction. Use a tagged state of the repository, npm, or bower for stability!\n\n## Feature requests\n\nMDL is currently in limited support mode, with no further development taking place by the core team.\nWe are happy to accept and review pull requests for new functionality, however, as long as there are no breaking\nchanges.\n\n## Want to contribute?\n\nIf you found a bug, have any questions or want to contribute. Follow our\n[guidelines](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/blob/mdl-1.x/CONTRIBUTING.md),\nand help improve the Material Design Lite. For more information visit our\n[wiki](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/wiki).\n\nPlease use the default branch, `mdl-1.x`.\n\nTake note that [Material Components for Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web), which is MDL v2, is under early Alpha stages (which means everything is a moving target, and we can change anything at any moment). Use with caution.\n\nHowever, we would absolutely love to have people testing MCW and provide feedback about their experiences using it, especially integrating with other frameworks and libraries.\n\n## License\n\n\u00a9 Google, 2015.
