Some users report that it works with the\nFirefox Developer Edition (>= 55) as well, but we strongly advise against doing\nso. It won't work at all in Firefox 54 Stable.\n\nYou can try it on [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switchyomega/),\nor grab a packaged extension file (XPI) for offline installation on the [Releases page](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/releases).\n\nPlease make sure that you are using the latest Nightly build before you\n[report issues](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/issues).\nBuild number AND build date should be mentioned somewhere in the issue.\n\nNOTE: PAC Profiles DO NOT work on Firefox due to AMO review policies. We will see what we can do.\n\nDevelopment status\n------------------\n\n## PAC generator\nThis project contains a PAC generating module called `omega-pac`, which handles\nthe profiles model and compile profiles into PAC scripts. This module is standalone\nand can be published to npm when the documentation is ready.\n\n## Options manager\nThe folder `omega-target` contains browser-independent logic for managing the\noptions and applying profiles. Every public method is well documented in the comments.\nFunctions related to browser are not included, and shall be implemented in subclasses\nof the `omega-target` classes.\n\n`omega-web` is a web-based configuration interface for various options and profiles.\nThe interface works great with `omega-target` as the back-end.\n\n`omega-web` alone is incomplete and requires a file named `omega_target_web.js`\ncontaining an angular module `omegaTarget`. The module contains browser-dependent\ncode to communicate with `omega-target` back-end, and other code retrieving\nbrowser-related state and information.\nSee the `omega-target-chromium-extension/omega_target_web.coffee` file for an\nexample of such module.\n\n## Targets\nThe `omega-target-*` folders should contain environment-dependent code such as\nbrowser API calls.\n\nEach target folder should contain an extended `OmegaTarget` object, which\ncontains subclasses of the abstract base classes like `Options`. The classes\ncontains implementation of the abstract methods, and can override other methods\nat will.\n\nA target can copy the files in `omega-web` into its build to provide a web-based\nconfiguration interface. If so, the target must provide the `omega_target_web.js`\nfile as described in the Options manager section.\n\nAdditionally, each target can contain other files and resources required for the\ntarget, such as background pages and extension manifests.\n\nFor now, only one target has been implemented: The WebExtension target.\nThis target allows the project to be used as a Chromium extension in most\nChromium-based browsers and also as a Firefox Addon as mentioned above.\n\n## Translation\n\nTranslation is hosted on Weblate.

Please note that\nnpm 2.x is required for this project.\n\nTo build the project:\n\n    # Install node and npm first (make sure npm --version > 2.0), then:\n    \n    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli@1.2.0 bower\n    # In the project folder:\n    cd omega-build\n    npm run deps # This runs npm install in every module.\n    npm run dev # This runs npm link to aid local development.\n    # Note: the previous command may require sudo in some environments.\n    # The modules are now working. We can build now:\n    grunt\n    # After building, a folder will be generated:\n    cd .. # Return to project root.\n    ls omega-chromium-extension/build/\n    # The folder above can be loaded as an unpacked extension in Chromium now.\n\nTo enable `grunt watch`, run `grunt watch` once in the `omega-build` directory.\nThis will effectively run `grunt watch` in every module in this project.\n\nLicense\n-------\n![GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/graphics/gplv3-127x51.png)\n\nSwitchyOmega is licensed under [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) Version 3 or later.\n\nSwitchyOmega is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nSwitchyOmega is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
