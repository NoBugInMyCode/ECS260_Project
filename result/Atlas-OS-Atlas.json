However, it cannot ensure privacy outside the scope of Windows, such as browsers and other third-party applications.\n\n### \ud83d\udcc8 Optimized Performance\nAtlas strikes a balance between performance and compatibility. It implements numerous meaningful changes to improve Windows performance and responsiveness without breaking essential features. Atlas will not do tweaks for a placebo effect or marginal gains, making Atlas more stable and compatible.\n\n### \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Security Features\nMost Windows modifications remove key security features most users need to maintain a secure system. On the other hand, Atlas allows users to customize their security at their own risk while informing users about each option's [pros and cons](https://docs.atlasos.net/getting-started/post-installation/atlas-folder/security/).\n\nSome optional security features are:\n\n- Windows Defender & SmartScreen\n- Windows Update\n  - Automatic updates are togglable\n- CPU mitigations\n- User Account Control\n- Core isolation features\n\n### \u2705 Increased Usability\nAtlas applies many modifications and default settings to make Windows easier to use. This includes removing commonly unneeded applications (which are reinstallable), configuring many aspects of the interface, disabling advertisements, and much more.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Open Source and Transparent\n\nUnlike custom Windows ISOs, Atlas is more straightforward to audit due to the use of [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io). AME Wizard is controlled by Playbooks, a customizable script-esque system that can perform various tasks.\n\nPlaybooks are renamed **.zip** archives, with the password [`malte`](https://docs.ameliorated.io/developers/getting-started/creation.html). As they primarily consist of plain text, Playbooks enable transparency, unlike custom Windows ISOs, which have many entry points for malicious activity. The few binaries in the Playbook are open source in our [`utilities` repository](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/utilities), with the [hashes listed here](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/src/playbook/Executables/AtlasModules/README.md).\n\nAlthough the GUI is not open source for AME Wizard, AME Wizard's entire backend (called [TrustedUninstaller](https://github.com/Ameliorated-LLC/trusted-uninstaller-cli)) is open source under MIT, which contains each action used to run Atlas. The Atlas Playbook is open source under the [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n### \ud83d\udd12 Legal Compliance\nAs Atlas doesn't redistribute a modified Windows ISO, it complies with [Windows's Usage Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/useterms/#areaheading-uid6738235). In addition, Atlas does not alter activation in Windows.\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 Brand kit\nWant to create your own Atlas wallpaper with some original creative designs?
