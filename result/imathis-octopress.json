If this is not the case, [please submit a\nfix to our docs repo](https://github.com/octopress/docs).\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/imathis/octopress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/imathis/octopress)\n\nWe love to see people contributing to Octopress, whether it's a bug report, feature suggestion or a pull request. At the moment, we try to keep the core slick and lean, focusing on basic blogging needs, so some of your suggestions might not find their way into Octopress. For those ideas, we started a [list of 3rd party plug-ins](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins), where you can link your own Octopress plug-in repositories. For the future, we're thinking about ways to easier add them into our main releases.\n\n\n## License\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2009-2013 Brandon Mathis\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u2018Software\u2019), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u2018AS IS\u2019, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
