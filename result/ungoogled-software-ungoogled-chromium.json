Unlike other Chromium forks that have their own visions of a web browser, ungoogled-chromium is essentially a drop-in replacement for Chromium.\n3. **ungoogled-chromium features tweaks to enhance privacy, control, and transparency**. However, almost all of these features must be manually activated or enabled. For more details, see [Feature Overview](#feature-overview).\n\nIn scenarios where the objectives conflict, the objective of higher significance should take precedence.\n\n## Content Overview\n\n* [Objectives](#objectives)\n* [Motivation and Philosophy](#motivation-and-philosophy)\n* [Feature Overview](#feature-overview)\n* [**Downloads**](#downloads)\n* [Source Code](#source-code)\n* [**FAQ**](#faq)\n* [Building Instructions](#building-instructions)\n* [Design Documentation](#design-documentation)\n* [**Contributing, Reporting, Contacting**](#contributing-reporting-contacting)\n* [Credits](#credits)\n* [Related Projects](#related-projects)\n* [License](#license)\n\n## Motivation and Philosophy\n\nWithout signing in to a Google Account, Chromium does pretty well in terms of security and privacy. However, Chromium still has some dependency on Google web services and binaries. In addition, Google designed Chromium to be easy and intuitive for users, which means they compromise on transparency and control of internal operations.\n\nungoogled-chromium addresses these issues in the following ways:\n\n1. Remove all remaining background requests to any web services while building and running the browser\n2. Remove all code specific to Google web services\n3. Remove all uses of pre-made binaries from the source code, and replace them with user-provided alternatives when possible.\n4. Disable features that inhibit control and transparency, and add or modify features that promote them (these changes will almost always require manual activation or enabling).\n\nThese features are implemented as configuration flags, patches, and custom scripts. For more details, consult the [Design Documentation](docs/design.md).\n\n## Feature Overview\n\n*This section overviews the features of ungoogled-chromium. For more detailed information, it is best to consult the source code.*\n\nContents of this section:\n\n* [Key Features](#key-features)\n* [Enhancing Features](#enhancing-features)\n* [Borrowed Features](#borrowed-features)\n* [Supported Platforms and Distributions](#supported-platforms-and-distributions)\n\n### Key Features\n\n*These are the core features introduced by ungoogled-chromium.*\n\n* Disable functionality specific to Google domains (e.g. Google Host Detector, Google URL Tracker, Google Cloud Messaging, Google Hotwording, etc.)\n    * This includes disabling [Safe Browsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Safe_Browsing). Consult [the FAQ for the rationale](https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-wiki/faq#why-is-safe-browsing-disabled).\n* Block internal requests to Google at runtime. This feature is a fail-safe measure for the above, in case Google changes or introduces new components that our patches do not disable. This feature is implemented by replacing many Google web domains in the source code with non-existent alternatives ending in `qjz9zk` (known as domain substitution; [see docs/design.md](docs/design.md#source-file-processors) for details), then [modifying Chromium to block its own requests with such domains](patches/core/ungoogled-chromium/block-trk-and-subdomains.patch). In other words, no connections are attempted to the `qjz9zk` domain.\n* Strip binaries from the source code (known as binary pruning; [see docs/design.md](docs/design.md#source-file-processors) for details)\n\n### Enhancing Features\n\n*These are the non-essential features introduced by ungoogled-chromium.*\n\n* Add many new command-line switches and `chrome://flags` entries to configure new features (which are disabled by default). See [docs/flags.md](docs/flags.md) for the exhaustive list.\n* Add *Suggestions URL* text field in the search engine editor (`chrome://settings/searchEngines`) for customizing search engine suggestions.\n* Add more URL schemes allowed to save page schemes.\n* Add Omnibox search provider \"No Search\" to allow disabling of searching\n* Add a custom cross-platform build configuration and packaging wrapper for Chromium. It currently supports many Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows. (See [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) for details on the system.)\n* Force all pop-ups into tabs\n* Disable automatic formatting of URLs in Omnibox (e.g. stripping `http://`, hiding certain parameters)\n* Disable intranet redirect detector (extraneous DNS requests)\n    * This breaks captive portal detection, but captive portals still work.\n* (Iridium Browser feature change) Prevent URLs with the `trk:` scheme from connecting to the Internet\n    * Also prevents any URLs with the top-level domain `qjz9zk` (as used in domain substitution) from attempting a connection.\n* (Windows-specific) Do not set the Zone Identifier on downloaded files\n\n### Borrowed Features\n\nIn addition to the features introduced by ungoogled-chromium, ungoogled-chromium selectively borrows many features from the following projects (in approximate order of significance):\n\n* [Inox patchset](https://github.com/gcarq/inox-patchset)\n* [Bromite](https://github.com/bromite/bromite)\n* [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/chromium)\n* [Iridium Browser](https://iridiumbrowser.de/)\n\n### Supported Platforms and Distributions\n\n[See docs/platforms.md for a list of supported platforms](docs/platforms.md).\n\nOther platforms are discussed and tracked in this repository's Issue Tracker. Learn more about using the Issue Tracker under the section [Contributing, Reporting, Contacting](#contributing-reporting-contacting).\n\n## Downloads\n\n### Automated or maintained builds\n\nungoogled-chromium is available in the following **software repositories**:\n\n* Arch: Available in AUR & OBS, [see instructions in ungoogled-chromium-archlinux](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-archlinux)\n* Debian & Ubuntu: Available in OBS, find your [distribution specific instructions](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-debian) in the Installing section\n* Fedora: Available in [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/) as [`wojnilowicz/ungoogled-chromium`](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/wojnilowicz/ungoogled-chromium/).
