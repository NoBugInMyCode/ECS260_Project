Run `wego` once. You will get an error message, but the `.wegorc` config file\n   will be generated in your `$HOME` directory (it will be hidden in some file\n   managers due to the filename starting with a dot).\n0. __With an [Openweathermap](https://home.openweathermap.org/) account__\n    * You can create an account and get a free API key by [signing up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)\n    * Update the following `.wegorc` config variables to fit your needs:\n    ```\n      backend=openweathermap\n      location=New York\n      owm-api-key=YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY_HERE\n    ```\n0. __With a [Worldweatheronline](http://www.worldweatheronline.com/) account__\n    * Worldweatheronline no longer gives out free API keys. [#83](https://github.com/schachmat/wego/issues/83)\n    * Update the following `.wegorc` config variables to fit your needs:\n    ```\n      backend=worldweatheronline\n      location=New York\n      wwo-api-key=YOUR_WORLDWEATHERONLINE_API_KEY_HERE\n    ```\n0. You may want to adjust other preferences like `days`, `units` and `\u2026-lang` as\n   well. Save the file.\n0. Run `wego` once again and you should get the weather forecast for the current\n   and next few days for your chosen location.\n0. If you're visiting someone in e.g. London over the weekend, just run `wego 4\n   London` or `wego London 4` (the ordering of arguments makes no difference) to\n   get the forecast for the current and the next 3 days.\n\nYou can set the `$WEGORC` environment variable to override the default config\nfile location.\n\n## Todo\n\n* more [backends and frontends](https://github.com/schachmat/wego/wiki/How-to-write-a-new-backend-or-frontend)\n* resolve ALL the [issues](https://github.com/schachmat/wego/issues)\n* don't forget the [TODOs in the code](https://github.com/schachmat/wego/search?q=TODO&type=Code)\n\n## License - ISC\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2017,  <teichm@in.tum.de>\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose\nwith or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice\nand this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH\nREGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS.
