GoReplay offers you the simple idea of reusing your existing traffic for testing, which makes it incredibly powerful. Our state of art technique allows you to analyze and record your application traffic without affecting it. This eliminates the risks that come with putting a third party component in the critical path. \n\nGoReplay increases your confidence in code deployments, configuration and infrastructure changes.\n\n\nGoReplay offers a unique approach for shadowing. Instead of being a proxy, GoReplay listens in the background for traffic on your network interfaces, requiring no changes in your production infrastructure, other than running GoReplay daemon on the same machine as your service.\n\n![Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/IN2xfDm.png)\n\nCheck [latest documentation](http://github.com/buger/goreplay/wiki).\n\n## Installation\nDownload the latest binary from https://github.com/buger/goreplay/releases or [compile by yourself](https://github.com/buger/goreplay/wiki/Compilation).\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe most basic setup will be `sudo ./gor --input-raw :8000 --output-stdout` which acts like tcpdump.\nIf you already have a test environment, you can start replaying by running: `sudo ./gor --input-raw :8000 --output-http http://staging.env`.\n\nSee our [documentation](https://github.com/buger/goreplay/wiki/) and the [Getting Started](https://github.com/buger/goreplay/wiki/Getting-Started) page for more info. \n\n## Newsletter\nSubscribe to our [newsletter](https://www.getdrip.com/forms/89690474/submissions/new) to stay informed about the latest features and changes to the Gor project.\n\n## Want to Upgrade?\n\nWe have created a [GoReplay PRO](https://goreplay.org/pro.html) extension which provides additional features such as support for binary protocols like Thrift or ProtocolBuffers, saving and replaying from cloud storage, TCP session replication, etc. The PRO version also includes a commercial-friendly license, dedicated support, and it also allows you to support high-quality open source development. \n\n\n## Problems?\nIf you have a problem, please review the [FAQ](https://github.com/buger/goreplay/wiki/FAQ) and [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/buger/goreplay/wiki/Troubleshooting) wiki pages.
