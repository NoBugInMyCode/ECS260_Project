See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [issues list](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues) if you would like to help.\n\nThe [`dotnet/AspNetDocs` GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetDocs)contains the ASP.NET 4.x documentation.\n\n## How to open an issue\n\nIf the issue is with an ASP.NET Core document:\n\n* Do **not** open a blank issue.\n* Open the issue using the **Open a documentation issue** link and feedback form at the bottom of the article. \n\nUsing the **Open a documentation issue** link and form to open an issue adds article metadata for tracking, which indicates the article that you're commenting on and automatically pings the author for a faster response.\n\nIf the issue is:\n\n* A simple typo or similar correction, you can submit a PR. See [the contributor guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/#quick-edits-to-existing-documents) for instructions.\n* A general support question, consider asking on a support forum site:\n  * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net-core)\n  * [ASP.NET Core Slack](https://aspnetcore.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-1mv5487zb-EOZxJ1iqb0A0ajowEbxByQ#/shared-invite/email)\n  * [ASP.NET Gitter](https://gitter.im/aspnet/Home)\n* A site design concern, create an issue at [MicrosoftDocs/Feedback](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Feedback/issues/new/choose).\n* A problem completing a tutorial, compare your code with the completed sample.\n* A duplicate of an open or closed issue, leave a comment on that issue.\n",
