We hope it\u2019s also of interest to API designers\noutside of Heroku.\n\nOur goals here are consistency and focusing on business logic while\navoiding design bikeshedding. We\u2019re looking for _a good, consistent,\nwell-documented way_ to design APIs, not necessarily _the only/ideal\nway_.\n\nWe assume you\u2019re familiar with the basics of HTTP+JSON APIs and won\u2019t\ncover all of the fundamentals of those in this guide.\n\nAvailable for online reading and in multiple formats at [gitbook](https://geemus.gitbooks.io/http-api-design).\n\nWe welcome [contributions](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this guide.\n\nSee [Summary](en/SUMMARY.md) for Table of Contents.\n\nFor the best reading experience, we recommend reading via [GitBook](https://geemus.gitbooks.io/http-api-design).\n\n### Gitbook Translations\n * [English](https://geemus.gitbooks.io/http-api-design/content/en/index.html)\n * [Italian](https://geemus.gitbooks.io/http-api-design/content/it/index.html) (based on [f12db3e](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design/commit/f12db3e)), by [@diegomariani](https://github.com/diegomariani/)\n * [Simplified Chinese](https://one-programmer.github.io/docs/http-api-design/) (based on [40d114b](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design/commit/40d114b6efbc60b84c804dbe7ad34b0d5e155a49)), by [@ZhangBohan](https://github.com/ZhangBohan/)\n\n### Git Translations\n * [Korean](https://github.com/yoondo/http-api-design) (based on [f38dba6](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design/commit/f38dba6fd8e2b229ab3f09cd84a8828987188863)), by [@yoondo](https://github.com/yoondo/)\n * [Portuguese](https://github.com/Gutem/http-api-design/) (based on [fba98f08b5](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design/commit/fba98f08b50acbb08b7b30c012a6d0ca795e29ee)), by [@Gutem](https://github.com/Gutem/)\n * [Simplified Chinese](https://github.com/ZhangBohan/http-api-design-ZH_CN) (based on [337c4a0](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design/commit/337c4a05ad08f25c5e232a72638f063925f3228a)), by [@ZhangBohan](https://github.com/ZhangBohan/)\n * [Spanish](https://github.com/jmnavarro/http-api-design) (based on [2a74f45](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design/commit/2a74f45b9afaf6c951352f36c3a4e1b0418ed10b)), by [@jmnavarro](https://github.com/jmnavarro/)\n * [Traditional Chinese](https://github.com/kcyeu/http-api-design) (based on [232f8dc](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design/commit/232f8dc6a941d0b25136bf64998242dae5575f66)), by [@kcyeu](https://github.com/kcyeu/)\n * [Turkish](https://github.com/hkulekci/http-api-design/tree/master/tr) (based on [c03842f](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design/commit/c03842fda80261e82860f6dc7e5ccb2b5d394d51)), by [@hkulekci](https://github.com/hkulekci/)\n",
