For the latest stable and beta releases, visit the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/iina/iina/releases) or the [IINA official website](https://iina.io/). If you want to try out the latest features and improvements before they are officially released, you can download the nightly builds from our [Nightly Download Page](https://iina.io/nightly/).\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Nightly builds are generated by GitHub automatically for every commits, which might be buggy and unusable. If you find a bug, please follow the [contributing section](#Contributing) and file an issue.\n\n## Building\n\nIINA uses mpv for media playback. To build IINA, you can either fetch copies of these libraries we have already built (using the instructions below) or build them yourself by skipping to [these instructions](#building-mpv-manually).\n\n### Using the pre-compiled libraries\n\n1. Download pre-compiled libraries by running\n\n```console\n./other/download_libs.sh\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> - Change the URL in the shell script if you want to download arch-specific binaries. By default, it will download the universal ones. You can download other binaries from `https://iina.io/dylibs/${ARCH}/fileList.txt` where `ARCH` can be `universal`, `arm64` and `x86_64`.\n> - If you want to build an older IINA version, make sure to download the corresponding dylibs. For example, `https://iina.io/dylibs/1.2.0/universal/fileList.txt`.\n\n2. Open iina.xcodeproj in the [latest public version of Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835). *IINA may not build if you use any other version.*\n\n3. Build the project.\n\n### Building mpv manually\n\n1. Build your own copy of mpv. If you're using a package manager to manage dependencies, the steps below outline the process.\n\n\t#### With Homebrew\n\n\tUse our tap as it passes in the correct flags to mpv's configure script:\n\n\t```console\n\tbrew tap iina/homebrew-mpv-iina\n\tbrew install mpv-iina\n\t```\n\n\t#### With MacPorts\n\n\tPass in these flags when installing:\n\n\t```console\n\tport install mpv +uchardet -bundle -rubberband configure.args=\"--enable-libmpv-shared --enable-lua --enable-libarchive --enable-libbluray --disable-swift --disable-rubberband\"\n\t```\n\n2. Copy the corresponding mpv and FFmpeg header files into `deps/include/`, replacing the current ones. You can find them on GitHub [(e.g. mpv)](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/master/libmpv), but it's recommended to copy them from the Homebrew or MacPorts installation. Always make sure the header files have the same version of the dylibs.\n\n3. Run `other/parse_doc.rb`. This script will fetch the latest mpv documentation and generate `MPVOption.swift`, `MPVCommand.swift` and `MPVProperty.swift`. Copy them from `other/` to `iina/`, replacing the current files. This is only needed when updating libmpv. Note that if the API changes, the player source code may also need to be changed.\n\n4. Run `other/change_lib_dependencies.rb`. This script will deploy the dependent libraries into `deps/lib`. If you're using a package manager to manage dependencies, invoke it like so:\n\n\t#### With Homebrew\n\n\t```console\n\tother/change_lib_dependencies.rb \"$(brew --prefix)\" \"$(brew --prefix mpv-iina)/lib/libmpv.dylib\"\n\t```\n\n\t#### With MacPorts\n\n\t```console\n\tport contents mpv | grep '\\.dylib$' | xargs other/change_lib_dependencies.rb /opt/local\n\t```\n\n5. Open `iina.xcodeproj` in the [latest public version of Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835). *IINA may not build if you use any other version.*\n\n6. Remove all references to `.dylib` files from the Frameworks group in the sidebar and add all the `.dylib` files in `deps/lib` to that group by clicking  \"Add Files to iina...\" in the context menu.\n\n7. Add all the imported `.dylib` files into the \"Copy Dylibs\" phase under \"Build Phases\" tab of the iina target.\n\n8. Make sure the necessary `.dylib` files are present in the \"Link Binary With Libraries\" phase under \"Build Phases\". Xcode should have already added all dylibs under this section.\n\n9. Build the project.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIINA is always looking for contributions, whether it's through bug reports, code, or new translations.\n\n* If you find a bug in IINA, or would like to suggest a new feature or enhancement, it'd be nice if you could [search your problem first](https://github.com/iina/iina/issues); while we don't mind duplicates, keeping issues unique helps us save time and consolidates effort. If you can't find your issue, feel free to [file a new one](https://github.com/iina/iina/issues/new/choose).\n\n* If you're looking to contribute code, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) \u2014 it has information on IINA's process for handling contributions, and tips on how the code is structured to make your work easier.\n\n* If you'd like to translate IINA to your language, please visit [IINA's instance of Crowdin](https://translate.iina.io/). You can create an account for free and start translating. Please do not send a pull request to this repo directly, Crowdin will automatically sync new translations with our repo. If you want to translate IINA into a new language that is currently not on the list, feel free to open an issue.\n",
