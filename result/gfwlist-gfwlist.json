There is a government-run firewall that blocks and interferes with websites containing sensitive or unwanted information. Meanwhile there\u2019s an extensive network of self-censors in all domestic Internet companies who delete contents which might incur the wrath of the people behind the rigorous censorship regime, while there are also lots of websites refuse to crouch. Hence they are often blocked.\n\nThere are other cases for example many streaming services or restricted content providers have blocked IPs from China. What a pity!\n\nWe don't dismantle the wall, we just find a hole to bypass then instead. Don't ask us how to bypass, we don't know. And don't ask us what a wall is, it's not a continuous vertical brick or stone structure that encloses or divides an area of land.\n\nTL;DR: This list embraces websites which Chinese authorities and some service providers don't want Chinese to view on the Internet.\n\n---\n## If you want to report, make sure check our [wiki](https://github.com/gfwlist/gfwlist/wiki/Cautions) first.\n\n## In case you want to request anonymity, you can send report to us directly, please visit [this profile](https://github.com/cicku) to retrieve the email address.\n\nWARNING:\n\n* Due to the peculiar network control, it is **impractical** to deal with reports from users of provinces below:\n\n  - Tibet (Tibet Autonomous Region)\n  - Shinjang (XinJiang Uyghur Autonomous Region)\n  - Qinghai (Qinghai Province)\n  \n  Example: Baidu Wangpan is not allowed to use in XinJiang, but adding it into the list will cause trouble to the people living in the rest of the country.\n  \n  Therefore, any user within these areas is encouraged to either maintain custom rules, or use proxy all the time.\n\n* GFWList doesn't provide prompt update for URLs submitted, normally they will be fully tested before adding into the list.\n\n---\n\nGFWList URL(Github): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gfwlist/gfwlist/master/gfwlist.txt\n\n**Notwithstanding Github is competent for distribution, to hedge outages or connection issues we still recommend using any URL below.**\n\n**Official mirror URLs:**\n1.
