This is the app's **main process**.\n- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.\n- `preload.js` - A content script that runs before the renderer process loads.\n\nYou can learn more about each of these components in depth within the [Tutorial](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-prerequisites).\n\n## To Use\n\nTo clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:\n\n```bash\n# Clone this repository\ngit clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start\n# Go into the repository\ncd electron-quick-start\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n# Run the app\nnpm start\n```\n\nNote: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.\n\n## Resources for Learning Electron\n\n- [electronjs.org/docs](https://electronjs.org/docs) - all of Electron's documentation\n- [Electron Fiddle](https://electronjs.org/fiddle) - Electron Fiddle, an app to test small Electron experiments\n\n## License\n\n[CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)](LICENSE.md)\n",
