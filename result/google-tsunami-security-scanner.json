All publicly available Tsunami plugins are hosted in a separate\n[google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins)\nrepository.\n\n## Current Status\n\n*   Currently Tsunami is in 'pre-alpha' release for developer preview.\n*   Tsunami project is currently under active development. Do expect major API\n    changes in the future.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nTo quickly get started with Tsunami scans,\n\n### Traditional install\n 1.  install the following required dependencies:\n\n     ```\n     nmap >= 7.80\n     ncrack >= 0.7\n     ```\n\n 1.  start a vulnerable application that can be identified by Tsunami, e.g. an\n      unauthenticated Jupyter Notebook server. The easiest way is to use a docker\n      image:\n     ```shell\n     docker run --name unauthenticated-jupyter-notebook -p 8888:8888 -d jupyter/base-notebook start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token=''\n     ```\n\n 1.  execute the following command:\n\n     ```\n     bash -c \"$(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner/master/quick_start.sh)\"\n     ```\n\n The `quick_start.sh` script performs the following tasks:\n\n 1.  Clone the\n     [google/tsunami-security-scanner](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner)\n     and\n     [google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins)\n     repos into `$HOME/tsunami/repos` directory.\n 1.  Compile all\n     [Google Tsunami plugins](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins/tree/master/google)\n     and move all plugin `jar` files into `$HOME/tsunami/plugins` directory.\n 1.  Compile the Tsunami scanner Fat Jar file and move it into `$HOME/tsunami`\n     directory.\n 1.  Move the `tsunami.yaml` example config into `$HOME/tsunami` directory.\n 1.  Print example Tsunami command for scanning `127.0.0.1` using the previously\n     generated artifacts.\n\n#### Advanced Configuration with Callback Server and Python Language Server\n\n 1.  execute the following command:\n\n     ```\n     bash -c \"$(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner/master/quick_start_advanced.sh)\"\n     ```\n\n### Docker install\n\n1.  start a vulnerable application that can be identified by Tsunami, e.g. an\n    unauthenticated Jupyter Notebook server. The easiest way is to use a docker\n    image:\n\n    ```shell\n    docker run --name unauthenticated-jupyter-notebook -p 8888:8888 -d jupyter/base-notebook start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token=''\n    ```\n\n1.  build the docker image for Tsunami:\n\n    ```shell\n    docker build -t tsunami .\n    ```\n\n1.  run the Tsunami image. The logs can be saved to the host machine by mounting\n    a volume:\n\n    ```shell\n    docker run --network=\"host\" -v \"$(pwd)/logs\":/usr/tsunami/logs tsunami\n    ```\n\n1.  debugging issues with Tsunami container. The tsunami container is based on\n    Debian. To run debug tools simply exec into the container and install them:\n\n    ```shell\n    docker exec -it tsunami bash\n    ```\n\n## Contributing\n\nRead how to [contribute to Tsunami](docs/contributing.md).\n\n## License\n\nTsunami is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).\n\n```\nCopyright 2019 Google Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nTsunami is not an official Google product.\n",
