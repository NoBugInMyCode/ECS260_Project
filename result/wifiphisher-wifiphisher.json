Using Wifiphisher, penetration testers can easily achieve a man-in-the-middle position against wireless clients by performing targeted Wi-Fi association attacks. Wifiphisher can be further used to mount victim-customized web phishing attacks against the connected clients in order to capture credentials (e.g. from third party login pages or WPA/WPA2 Pre-Shared Keys) or infect the victim stations with malwares.\n\nWifiphisher is...\n\n* ...powerful. Wifiphisher can run for hours inside a Raspberry Pi device\nexecuting all modern Wi-Fi association techniques (including \"Evil Twin\", \"KARMA\" and \"Known Beacons\").  \n\n* ...flexible. Supports dozens of arguments and comes with a set of\ncommunity-driven phishing templates for different deployment scenarios.  \n\n* ...modular. Users can <a href=\"http://wifiphisher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions.html\">write simple or complicated modules</a> in Python to expand the functionality of the tool or <a href=\"http://wifiphisher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_phishing_scenario.html\">create custom phishing scenarios</a> in order to conduct specific target-oriented attacks. \n\n* ...easy to use. Advanced users can utilize the rich set of features that Wifiphisher offers but beginners may start out as simply as \"./bin/wifiphisher\". The interactive Textual User Interface guides the tester through the build process of the attack. \n\n* ...the result of an extensive research. Attacks like \"Known Beacons\" and \"Lure10\" as well as state-of-the-art phishing techniques, were disclosed by our developers, and Wifiphisher was the first tool to incorporate them. \n\n* ...supported by an awesome community of developers and users.\n\n* ...free. Wifiphisher is available for free download, and also comes with full\nsource code that you may study, change, or distribute under the terms of the \nGPLv3 license.\n\n## Sponsors \n\nWifiphisher is free (as in speech, and as in beer) and will always be. Continuous development of the project would not be possible without our sponsors and supporters:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.tines.com/?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=wifiphisher\"><p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.tines.com/?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=wifiphisher\"><img src=\"https://wifiphisher.github.io/wifiphisher/tines_logo.png\" /></a></p></a>\n\n## How it works\n\nWi-Fi phishing consists of two steps:\n\n1. The first step involves the process of associating with Wi-Fi clients\nunknowingly, or in other words, obtaining a man-in-the-middle (MITM) position. Wifiphisher uses a number of different techniques to achieve this including:\n    * Evil Twin, where Wifiphisher creates a fake wireless network that looks similar to a legitimate network.\n    * KARMA, where Wifiphisher masquerades as a public network searched for by nearby Wi-Fi clients.\n    * Known Beacons, where Wifiphisher broadcasts a dictionary of common ESSIDs, that the around wireless stations have likely connected to in the past.\n\n    At the same time, Wifiphisher keeps forging \u201cDeauthenticate\u201d or \u201cDisassociate\u201d packets to disrupt existing associations and eventually lure victims using the above techniques.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img width=\"70%\" src=\"https://wifiphisher.github.io/wifiphisher/diagram.jpg\" /><br /><i>Performing MiTM attack</i></p>\n\n2. (Optionally) There are a number of different attacks that can be carried out \nonce Wifiphisher grants the penetration tester with a man-in-the-middle\nposition. For example, the tester may perform data sniffing or scan the victim stations for vulnerabilities. \n\n    Using Wifiphisher, advanced web phishing techniques are possible by gathering\ninformation from the target environment and victim user. For example, in one of\nour scenarios, Wifiphisher will extract information from the broadcasted beacon\nframes and the HTTP User-Agent header to display a web-based imitation of\nWindows network manager in order to capture the Pre-Shared Key.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://wifiphisher.github.io/wifiphisher/ss-webphishing.png\" /><br /><i>Fake <a href=\"https://wifiphisher.org/ps/wifi_connect/\">web-based network manager</a></i></p>\n\n## Requirements\nFollowing are the requirements for getting the most out of Wifiphisher:\n\n  - A working Linux system. People have made Wifiphisher work on many distros, but Kali Linux is the officially supported distribution, thus all new features are primarily tested on this platform.\n  - One wireless network adapter that supports AP & Monitor mode and is capable of injection. Drivers should support netlink.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the latest development version type the following commands:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/wifiphisher/wifiphisher.git # Download the latest revision\ncd wifiphisher # Switch to tool's directory\nsudo python setup.py install # Install any dependencies\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can download the latest stable version from the <a href=\"https://github.com/wifiphisher/wifiphisher/releases\">Releases page</a>.\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the tool by typing `wifiphisher` or `python bin/wifiphisher` (from inside the tool's directory).\n\nBy running the tool without any options, it will find the right interfaces and interactively ask the user to pick the ESSID of the target network (out of a list with all the ESSIDs in the around area) as well as a phishing scenario to perform. By default, the tool will perform both Evil Twin and KARMA attacks.\n\n***\n\n```shell\nwifiphisher -aI wlan0 -jI wlan4 -p firmware-upgrade --handshake-capture handshake.pcap\n```\n\nUse wlan0 for spawning the rogue Access Point and wlan4 for DoS attacks. Select the target network manually from the list and perform the \"Firmware Upgrade\" scenario. Verify that the captured Pre-Shared Key is correct by checking it against the handshake in the handshake.pcap file.\n\nUseful for manually selecting the wireless adapters. The <a href=\"https://wifiphisher.org/ps/firmware-upgrade/\">\"Firmware Upgrade\"</a> scenario is an easy way for obtaining the PSK from a password-protected network.\n\n***\n\n```shell\nwifiphisher --essid CONFERENCE_WIFI -p plugin_update -pK s3cr3tp4ssw0rd\n```\n\nAutomatically pick the right interfaces. Target the Wi-Fi with ESSID \"CONFERENCE_WIFI\" and perform the \"Plugin Update\" scenario. The Evil Twin will be password-protected with PSK \"s3cr3tp4ssw0rd\".\n\nUseful against networks with disclosed PSKs (e.g. in conferences). The <a href=\"https://wifiphisher.org/ps/plugin_update/\">\"Plugin Update\"</a> scenario provides an easy way for getting the victims to download malicious executables (e.g. malwares containing a reverse shell payload).\n\n***\n\n```shell\nwifiphisher --essid \"FREE WI-FI\" -p oauth-login -kB\n```\n\nSimply spawn an open Wi-Fi network with ESSID \"FREE WI-FI\" and perform the \"OAuth Login\" scenario. Furthermore, mount the \"Known Beacons\" Wi-Fi automatic association technique.\n\nUseful against victims in public areas. The <a href=\"https://wifiphisher.org/ps/oauth-login/\">\"OAuth Login\"</a> scenario provides a simple way for capturing credentials from social networks, like Facebook. \n\n\nFollowing are all the options along with their descriptions (also available with `wifiphisher -h`):\n\n| Short form | Long form | Explanation |\n| :----------: | :---------: | :-----------: |\n|-h | --help| show this help message and exit |\n|-i INTERFACE| --interface INTERFACE| Manually choose an interface that supports both AP and monitor modes for spawning the rogue AP as well as mounting additional Wi-Fi attacks from Extensions (i.e. deauth).
