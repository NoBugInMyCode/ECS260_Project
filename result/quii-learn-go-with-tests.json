I feel like content like this is valuable as it is tackling people's _real_ questions around testing.\n\n* [OS exec](os-exec.md) - An example of how we can reach out to the OS to execute commands to fetch data and keep our business logic testable/\n* [Error types](error-types.md) - Example of creating your own error types to improve your tests and make your code easier to work with.\n* [Context-aware Reader](context-aware-reader.md) - Learn how to TDD augmenting `io.Reader` with cancellation. Based on [Context-aware io.Reader for Go](https://pace.dev/blog/2020/02/03/context-aware-ioreader-for-golang-by-mat-ryer)\n* [Revisiting HTTP Handlers](http-handlers-revisited.md) - Testing HTTP handlers seems to be the bane of many a developer's existence. This chapter explores the issues around designing handlers correctly.\n\n### Meta / Discussion\n\n* [Why unit tests and how to make them work for you](why.md) - Watch a video, or read about why unit testing and TDD is important\n* [Anti-patterns](anti-patterns.md) - A short chapter on TDD and unit testing anti-patterns\n\n## Contributing\n\n* _This project is work in progress_ If you would like to contribute, please do get in touch.\n* Read [contributing.md](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests/tree/842f4f24d1f1c20ba3bb23cbc376c7ca6f7ca79a/contributing.md) for guidelines\n* Any ideas? Create an issue\n\n## Background\n\nI have some experience introducing Go to development teams and have tried different approaches as to how to grow a team from some people curious about Go into highly effective writers of Go systems.\n\n### What didn't work\n\n#### Read _the_ book\n\nAn approach we tried was to take [the blue book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440) and every week discuss the next chapter along with the exercises.\n\nI love this book but it requires a high level of commitment. The book is very detailed in explaining concepts, which is obviously great but it means that the progress is slow and steady - this is not for everyone.\n\nI found that whilst a small number of people would read chapter X and do the exercises, many people didn't.\n\n#### Solve some problems\n\nKatas are fun but they are usually limited in their scope for learning a language; you're unlikely to use goroutines to solve a kata.\n\nAnother problem is when you have varying levels of enthusiasm. Some people just learn way more of the language than others and when demonstrating what they have done end up confusing people with features the others are not familiar with.\n\nThis ends up making the learning feel quite _unstructured_ and _ad hoc_.\n\n### What did work\n\nBy far the most effective way was by slowly introducing the fundamentals of the language by reading through [go by example](https://gobyexample.com/), exploring them with examples and discussing them as a group. This was a more interactive approach than \"read chapter x for homework\".\n\nOver time the team gained a solid foundation of the _grammar_ of the language so we could then start to build systems.\n\nThis to me seems analogous to practicing scales when trying to learn guitar.\n\nIt doesn't matter how artistic you think you are, you are unlikely to write good music without understanding the fundamentals and practicing the mechanics.\n\n### What works for me\n\nWhen _I_ learn a new programming language I usually start by messing around in a REPL but eventually, I need more structure.\n\nWhat I like to do is explore concepts and then solidify the ideas with tests. Tests verify the code I write is correct and documents the feature I have learned.\n\nTaking my experience of learning with a group and my own personal way I am going to try and create something that hopefully proves useful to other teams. Learning the fundamentals by writing small tests so that you can then take your existing software design skills and ship some great systems.\n\n## Who this is for\n\n* People who are interested in picking up Go.\n* People who already know some Go, but want to explore testing with TDD.\n\n## What you'll need\n\n* A computer!\n* [Installed Go](https://golang.org/)\n* A text editor\n* Some experience with programming. Understanding of concepts like `if`, variables, functions etc.\n* Comfortable using the terminal\n\n## Feedback\n\n* Add issues/submit PRs [here](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests) or [tweet me @quii](https://twitter.com/quii)\n\n[MIT license](LICENSE.md)\n\n[Logo is by egonelbre](https://github.com/egonelbre) What a star!\n",
