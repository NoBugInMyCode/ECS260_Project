No native compiling and no external dependencies.\n\nWhile young, Cash aims to offer an alternative Linux feel on Windows and to open the door to cross-platform bash scripting in a Javascript environment.\n\n```bash\n> npm install cash -g\n> cash\n$\n```\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"http://i.giphy.com/xT0BKNwUPFhFj2glry.gif\" alt=\"Cash\" />\n</p>\n\n\n### Woah.\n\nYeah. But it gets better. \n\nLet's mix some Windows & Unix commands together:\n\n```bash\n$ ipconfig | grep IPv4 | sort\nIPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.40.50\nIPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.100.11\n$\n```\n\n[Learn more](https://github.com/dthree/cash/wiki/Usage-|-Interactive)\n\n\n### But I don't want to type \"cash\"\n\nNo problem.

But I want this programmatically!\n\nAgain, you're in business:\n\n```js\nconst $ = require('cash');\nconst out = $.ls('.', {l: true});\n```\n\nNot terse enough? How about this:\n\n```js\nconst out = $('ls -lah');\n```\n\nNot :sunglasses: enough? Try this:\n\n```js\nrequire('cash') `\n  cp -R ./src ./dest\n  ls | grep *-spec.js | cat\n  rm ./specResults.html \n`;\n```\n\n*For even better programmatic Unix commands, check out [ShellJS](https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs).*\n\n[Learn more](https://github.com/dthree/cash/wiki/Usage-|-Programmatic)\n\n\n### Isn't this impossible to do in Node?\n\nIt was, before [Vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal).\n\nMade with \u2764 by [dthree](https://github.com/dthree).\n\nLove it? Give it a :star: or a tweet to help spread the word!\n\n\n## Notice\n\nThis is now an [OPEN Open Source](http://openopensource.org/) project. I am not able to invest a significant amount of time into maintaining Cash and so am looking for volunteers who would like to be active maintainers of the project.

Just add your configurations in a `.cashrc` file (`_cashrc` also works, for Windows folk) and put that in your home directory. This supports anything you can do inside a cash command prompt (`export`ing environmental variables, aliases, etc.).\n\n## Contributing\n\n- [Editing commands](https://github.com/dthree/cash/wiki/Contributing#editing-existing-commands)\n- [Adding new commands](https://github.com/dthree/cash/wiki/Contributing)\n\nWe are currently looking for Core Team members who can push forward Cash at a rapid rate. Are you an awesome developer up to the challenge? Send me a ping.\n\n### Awesome contributors\n\n- [@nfischer](https://github.com/nfischer): Added `source`, `export`, `true` and `false` commands, among several other contributions.\n- [@safinn](https://github.com/safinn): Added `clear` and `tail` commands.\n- [@legien](https://github.com/legien): Added `head` command.\n- [@cspotcode](https://github.com/cspotcode): Implemented template literal execution.\n\n## FAQ\n\n\n#### Why Cash?\n\nIn its very essence, Cash replaces the Windows CLI prompt (`>`) with the Unix one (`$`), the dollar symbol. \n\nCash was most fitting in this sense: \n\n> Ask and ye shall receive\n\n```\n> cash\n$\n````\n\nCash is also a play on the word `bash`, and is actually[\\[1\\]](https://xkcd.com/906) a recursive acronym for Cash Shell.\n\nShout out to [@aseemk](https://github.com/aseemk) for donating the name.\n\n\n#### Doesn't ShellJS do this?\n\nNo.\n \nFor those who don't know, [ShellJS](https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs) is an awesome Node package that implements UNIX shell commands programatically in JavaScript. Check it out - really. While ShellJS was tremendously helpful in figuring out how to accomplish Cash, the two do not really conflict.\n\nShellJS gives the feel of UNIX commands in a code environment, but aims to implement the commands in a way that makes sense for a JavaScript library. This means that many commands return JavaScript objects, and some of the rougher and more dangerous edges of bash have been softened a bit.\n\nFor example, with cash:\n```javascript\n$('ls'); // 'node_modules\\n'\n\n$('echo foo > foo.txt');\n```\n\nWith ShellJS:\n```javascript\nls(); // ['node_modules'];\n\necho('foo').to('foo.txt');\n```\n\n\n## Team\n\n| [![David Caccavella](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10319897?s=130)](https://github.com/dthree) | [![Nate Fischer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5801521?s=130)](https://github.com/nfischer) |\n|:---:|:---:|\n| [David Caccavella](https://github.com/dthree) | [Nate Fischer](https://github.com/nfischer) |\n\nWant to join the team?
