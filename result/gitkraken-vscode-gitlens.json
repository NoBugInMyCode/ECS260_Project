GitLens provides the context you need with tools like blame, hovers, and file annotations. But it doesn\u2019t stop there\u2014the interactive Commit Graph lets you create branches, rebase, revert, and more, all with powerful search capabilities.\n\n- [**Accelerate PR Reviews**](#accelerate-pr-reviews) &mdash; Reduce context switching and manage all your PRs in one place. Prioritize tasks and identify bottlenecks right in VS Code with Launchpad when you integrate Github or other host providers. Work on multiple branches at once without disrupting your main workspace with Worktrees.\n\n- [**Streamline Collaboration**](#streamline-collaboration) &mdash; GitLens isn\u2019t just for solo developers\u2014it\u2019s designed to enhance team collaboration. With Cloud Patches and Code Suggest, you can share and discuss suggested changes with any GitLens or GitKraken user, on multiple files and even PRs.\n\n# Interactive Code History\n\nUnderstanding who made changes, when, and why can be challenging. GitLens simplifies this with tools like the Commit Graph, Inspect, Inline Blame, and Hovers, giving you clear context and insights. Quickly explore your repository's history with intuitive visuals and actionable tools.\n\n## Blame, CodeLens, and Hovers\n\nGain a deeper understanding of how code changed and by whom through in-editor code annotations and rich hovers.\n\n### Inline and Status Bar Blame\n\nProvides historical context about line changes through unobtrusive **blame annotation** at the end of the current line and on the status bar.\n\n<figure align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/current-line-blame.png\" alt=\"Inline Line Blame\" />\n  <figcaption>Inline blame annotations</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/status-bar.png\" alt=\"Status Bar Blame\" />\n  <figcaption>Status bar blame annotations</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Use the `Toggle Line Blame` and `Toggle Git CodeLens` commands from the Command Palette to turn the annotations on and off.\n\n### Git CodeLens\n\nAdds contextual and actionable authorship information at the top of each file and at the beginning of each block of code.\n\n- **Recent Change** &mdash; author and date of the most recent commit for the file or code block\n- **Authors** &mdash; number of authors of the file or code block and the most prominent author (if there is more than one)\n\n### Rich Hovers\n\nHover over blame annotations to reveal rich details and actions.\n\n<figure align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/hovers-current-line.png\" alt=\"Current Line Hovers\" />\n</figure>\n\n## File Annotations\n\nUse on-demand whole file annotations to see authorship, recent changes, and a heatmap. Annotations are rendered as visual indicators directly in the editor.\n\n<figure align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/gutter-blame.png\" alt=\"File Blame\">\n  <figcaption>File Blame annotations</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/gutter-changes.png\" alt=\"File Changes\" />\n  <figcaption>File Changes annotations</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/gutter-heatmap.png\" alt=\"File Heatmap\" />\n  <figcaption>File Heatmap annotations</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\ud83d\udca1 On an active file, use the `Toggle File Blame`, `Toggle File Changes`, and `Toggle File Heatmap` commands from the Command Palette to turn the annotations on and off.\n\n## Commit Graph `Pro`\n\nEasily visualize your repository and keep track of all work in progress.\n\nUse the rich commit search to find exactly what you're looking for. Its powerful filters allow you to search by a specific commit, message, author, a changed file or files, or even a specific code change. [Learn more](https://gitkraken.com/solutions/commit-graph?utm_source=gitlens-extension&utm_medium=in-app-links)\n\n<figure align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/commit-graph.png\" alt=\"Commit Graph\" />\n</figure>\n\n\ud83d\udca1Quickly toggle the Graph via the `Toggle Commit Graph` command.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Maximize the Graph via the `Toggle Maximized Commit Graph` command.\n\n## Revision Navigation\n\nWith just a click of a button, you can navigate backwards and forwards through the history of any file. Compare changes over time and see the revision history of the whole file or an individual line.\n\n<figure align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/revision-navigation.gif\" alt=\"Revision Navigation\" />\n</figure>\n\n# Accelerate PR Reviews\n\nPR reviews often require switching between GitHub, email, and your IDE. Launchpad is your centralized PR hub in VS Code where you can spot bottlenecks, prioritize reviews and unblock your team. With Worktrees, you can work on multiple branches\u2014hotfixes, features, or experiments\u2014without disrupting your workspace.\n\n## Launchpad `Pro`\n\nLaunchpad consolidates all your GitHub pull requests into a unified, actionable list. Focus on the most important reviews and take action to keep your team moving forward.. [Learn more](https://gitkraken.com/solutions/launchpad?utm_source=gitlens-extension&utm_medium=in-app-links)\n\n<figure align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/launchpad.png\" alt=\"Launchpad\" />\n</figure>\n\n## Worktrees `Pro`\n\nWorktrees enable efficient multitasking by allowing you to work on multiple branches without stashing changes or leaving your current branch. They preserve your workflow while letting you shift focus when needed. For example, you can easily review a pull request on a worktree in a separate VS Code window with GitLens.\n\n<figure align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/worktrees.png\" alt=\"Worktrees view\" />\n</figure>\n\n# Streamline Collaboration\n\nGitLens isn\u2019t just for solo developers\u2014it\u2019s designed to enhance team collaboration. Sharing code can be tricky without adding noise to your repository with extra commits or branches. GitLens simplifies this with Cloud Patches and Code Suggest, letting you share or propose changes to any file in the repository without committing or pushing to a remote.\n\n## Cloud Patches `Preview`\n\nPrivately and securely share code changes by creating a Cloud Patch from your work-in-progress, commit, or stash, and sharing a link with specific teammates and other developers. Cloud Patches enable early collaboration for feedback on direction and approach, reducing rework and streamlining your workflow, without adding noise to your repositories. [Learn more](https://gitkraken.com/solutions/cloud-patches?utm_source=gitlens-extension&utm_medium=in-app-links)\n\n## Code Suggest `Preview`\n\nBreak free from GitHub's limited, comment-only review feedback. With GitLens, you can suggest code changes directly from your IDE, just like editing a Google Doc. Provide feedback on any part of your project during a review\u2014not just the lines changed in a PR.
