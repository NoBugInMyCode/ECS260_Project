API Endpoint in [NodeJS](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-node-simple-http-endpoint), [Python](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-python-simple-http-endpoint), [Java](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-java-simple-http-endpoint), or [Golang](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-golang-simple-http-endpoint).\n\n## Examples\n\nEach example contains a `README.md` with an explanation about the service and it's use cases.\n\n**Have an example?** Submit a PR or [open an issue](https://github.com/serverless/examples/issues). \u26a1\ufe0f\n\nTo install any of these you can run:\n\n```bash\nserverless install -u
