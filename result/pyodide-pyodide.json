Any pure\nPython package with a wheel available on PyPi is supported. Many packages with C\nextensions have also been ported for use with Pyodide. These include many\ngeneral-purpose packages such as regex, PyYAML, lxml and scientific Python\npackages including NumPy, pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.\n\nPyodide comes with a robust Javascript \u27fa Python foreign function interface so\nthat you can freely mix these two languages in your code with minimal friction.\nThis includes full support for error handling, async/await, and much more.\n\nWhen used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.\n\n## Try Pyodide (no installation needed)\n\nTry Pyodide in a\n[REPL](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html) directly in\nyour browser. For further information, see the\n[documentation](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPyodide offers three different ways to get started depending on your needs and\ntechnical resources. These include:\n\n- Use a hosted distribution of Pyodide: see the [Getting\n  Started](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/quickstart.html) documentation.\n- Download a version of Pyodide from the [releases\n  page](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases/) and serve it\n  with a web server.\n- [Build Pyodide from source](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/building-from-sources.html)\n  - Build natively with `make`: primarily for Linux users who want to\n    experiment or contribute back to the project.\n  - [Use a Docker image](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/building-from-sources.html#using-docker):\n    recommended for Windows and macOS users and for Linux users who prefer a\n    Debian-based Docker image with the dependencies already installed.\n\n## History\n\nPyodide was created in 2018 by [Michael Droettboom](https://github.com/mdboom)\nat Mozilla as part of the [Iodide\nproject](https://github.com/iodide-project/iodide). Iodide is an experimental\nweb-based notebook environment for literate scientific computing and\ncommunication.\n\nIodide is no longer maintained. If you want to use Pyodide in an interactive\nclient-side notebook, see [Pyodide notebook\nenvironments](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/related-projects.html#notebook-environments-ides-repls).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease view the [contributing\nguide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/contributing.html) for tips\non filing issues, making changes, and submitting pull requests. Pyodide is an\nindependent and community-driven open-source project. The decision-making\nprocess is outlined in the [Project\ngovernance](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/governance.html).\n\n## Communication\n\n- Blog: [blog.pyodide.org](https://blog.pyodide.org/)\n- Mailing list: [mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pyodide.python.org/](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pyodide.python.org/)\n- Twitter: [twitter.com/pyodide](https://twitter.com/pyodide)\n- Stack Overflow: [stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pyodide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pyodide)\n- Discord: [Pyodide Discord](https://dsc.gg/pyodide)\n\n## License\n\nPyodide uses the [Mozilla Public License Version\n2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/).\n",
