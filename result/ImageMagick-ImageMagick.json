It can be used to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images, and supports a wide range of file [formats](https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php), including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and PDF.\n\n## What is ImageMagick?\n\nImageMagick is widely used in industries such as web development, graphic design, and video editing, as well as in scientific research, medical imaging, and astronomy. Its versatile and customizable nature, along with its robust image processing capabilities, make it a popular choice for a wide range of image-related tasks.\n\nImageMagick includes a command-line interface for executing complex image processing tasks, as well as APIs for integrating its features into software applications. It is written in C and can be used on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.\n\nThe main website for ImageMagick can be found at [https://imagemagick.org](https://imagemagick.org/). The source code for this software can be accessed through a [repository](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick). In addition, we maintain a legacy version of ImageMagick [version 6](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/).\n\nCreating a security policy that fits your specific local environment before making use of ImageMagick is highly advised. You can find guidance on setting up this [policy](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php). Also, it's important to verify your policy using the [validation tool](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php).\n\n## Features and Capabilities\n\nOne of the key features of ImageMagick is its support for scripting and automation. This allows users to create complex image manipulation pipelines that can be run automatically, without the need for manual intervention. This can be especially useful for tasks that require the processing of large numbers of images, or for tasks that need to be performed on a regular basis.\n\nIn addition to its core image manipulation capabilities, ImageMagick also includes a number of other features, such as support for animation, color management, and image rendering. These features make it a versatile tool for a wide range of image-related tasks, including graphic design, scientific visualization, and digital art.\n\nOverall, ImageMagick is a powerful and versatile software suite for displaying, converting, and editing image files. Its support for scripting and automation, along with its other features, make it a valuable tool for a wide range of image-related tasks.\n\nHere are just a few [examples](https://imagemagick.org/script/examples.php) of what ImageMagick can do:\n\n* [Animation](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#bilateral-blur): non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter.\n* [Bilateral Blur](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#bilateral-blur): non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter.\n* [Color management](https://imagemagick.org/script/color-management.php): accurate color management with color profiles or in lieu of-- built-in gamma compression or expansion as demanded by the colorspace.\n* [Color thresholding](https://imagemagick.org/script/color-management.php) force all pixels in the color range to white otherwise black.\n* [Command-line processing](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php) utilize ImageMagick from the command-line.\n* [Complex text layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_text_layout) bidirectional text support and shaping.\n* [Composite](https://imagemagick.org/script/composite.php): overlap one image over another.\n* [Connected component labeling](https://imagemagick.org/script/connected-components.php): uniquely label connected regions in an image.\n* [Convex hull](https://imagemagick.org/script/convex-hull.php) smallest area convex polygon containing the image foreground objects.

There are also several scripts available on the website called [Fred's ImageMagick Scripts](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/), which can be used to apply geometric transforms, blur and sharpen images, remove noise, and perform other operations. Additionally, there is a tool called [Magick.NET](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET) that allows users to access the functionality of ImageMagick without having to install the software on their own systems. Finally, the website also includes a [Cookbook](http://im.snibgo.com/) with tips and examples for using ImageMagick on Windows systems.\n\n## News\n\nCreating a security policy that fits your specific local environment before making use of ImageMagick is highly advised. You can find guidance on setting up this [policy](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php). Also, it's important to verify your policy using the [validation tool](https://imagemagick-secevaluator.doyensec.com/). As of ImageMagick version 7.1.1-16, you can choose and customize one of these [security policies](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php): Open, Limited, Secure, and Websafe.\n\nBy default, ImageMagick supports up to 32 channels. As of ImageMagick version 7.1.1-16, you can enable up to 64 channels by adding the **--enable-64bit-channel-masks** option to the Linux configure build script. For Windows this will be enabled automatically.\n\n\nWant more performance from ImageMagick? Try these options:\n\n* add more memory to your system, see the [pixel cache](https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#cache);\n* add more cores to your system, see [threads of execution support](https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#threads);\n* reduce lock contention with the [tcmalloc](http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html) memory allocation library;\n* push large images to a solid-state drive, see [large image support](https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#tera-pixel).\n\nIf these options are prohibitive, you can reduce the quality of the image results. The default build is Q16 HDRI. If you disable [HDRI](https://imagemagick.org/script/high-dynamic-range.php), you use half the memory and instead of predominantly floating point operations, you use the typically more efficient integer operations. The tradeoff is reduced precision and you cannot process out of range pixel values (e.g. negative). If you build the Q8 non-HDRI version of ImageMagick, you again reduce the memory requirements in half-- and once again there is a tradeoff, even less precision and no out of range pixel values. For a Q8 non-HDRI build of ImageMagick, use these configure script options: **--with-quantum-depth=8 --disable-hdri**.\n",
