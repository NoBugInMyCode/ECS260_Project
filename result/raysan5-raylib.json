You created your first window!\"` in the middle of the screen. Check this example [running live on web here](https://www.raylib.com/examples/core/loader.html?name=core_basic_window).\n```c\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    InitWindow(800, 450, \"raylib [core] example - basic window\");\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose())\n    {\n        BeginDrawing();\n            ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n            DrawText(\"Congrats!

There is no standard API documentation but there is a [**cheatsheet**](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html) containing all the functions available on the library a short description of each one of them, input parameters and result value names should be intuitive enough to understand how each function works. \n\nSome additional documentation about raylib design can be found in [raylib GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki). Here are the relevant links:\n\n - [raylib cheatsheet](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html)\n - [raylib architecture](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/raylib-architecture)\n - [raylib library design](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki)\n - [raylib examples collection](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/examples)\n - [raylib games collection](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib-games)\n\n\ncontact and networks\n---------------------\n\nraylib is present in several networks and raylib community is growing everyday.
