        "readme": "# Hey Monorepo\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or higher) - The backbone of our project, make sure you have this installed.\n- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) - Our trusty package manager, because who doesn't love faster installs?\n- [Postgres App](https://postgresapp.com/) - Our database of choice, because data needs a cozy home.\n- [Redis](https://redis.io/download) - The speedy in-memory data store, for when you need things done in a flash.\n\n## Installation\n\nWe harness the power of [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) to keep our monorepo running smoother than a freshly buttered pancake.\n\n### Clone the repository\n\nClone the Hey monorepo to your local machine:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:heyxyz/hey.git\n```\n\n### Install NVM (Node Version Manager) and pnpm\n\nRocking a macOS? You can grab both with Homebrew, like a true brew master:\n\n```bash\nbrew install nvm pnpm\n```\n\n### Install Node.js\n\nUse `nvm` to summon the magical version of Node.js you need:\n\n```bash\nnvm install\n```\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nTeleport yourself to the root of the repository and let pnpm sprinkle its dependency magic:\n\n```bash\npnpm install\n```\n\n### Create a `.env` file\n\nChannel your inner wizard and conjure up a `.env` file from the `.env.example` template for every package and app that needs it. Don't forget to sprinkle in the necessary environment variables!\n\n```bash\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\nDon't forget to play copycat and repeat this `.env` file creation for every package and app that needs it. Consistency is key!\n\n### Start the application\n\nWhen all the stars align and everything is in place, kick off the application in development mode:\n\n```bash\npnpm dev\n```\n\n## Build and Test\n\n### Build the application\n\nReady to build the application? Just run this command:\n\n```bash\npnpm build\n```\n\n### Test the application\n\nWant to run tests while you're developing? Here's how you do it:\n\n```bash\npnpm test\n```\n\n## Periodic Tasks\n\n### Remove unused exports and helpers\n\nWe use `ts-prune` to hunt down and eliminate unused exports and helpers lurking in our codebase. Just a heads-up: you'll need to run this task manually for each package and app. Happy pruning!\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web; npx ts-prune -i generated.ts\n```\n\n### Update dependencies\n\nTime to give our dependencies a makeover! We rely on the magical powers of `pnpm` to keep everything up-to-date and looking sharp.\n\n```bash\nscript/clean-branches\nscript/update-dependencies\n```\n\n### Update lock file\n\nWe trust `pnpm` to keep our lock file fresh and fabulous!\n\n```bash\nscript/clean-branches\nscript/update-lock-file\n```\n\n## Other tools you might like\n\n### Ripgrep\n\nWe use [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to search for text in the codebase. It's like `grep` and `ag` had a baby, and that baby grew up to be a speed demon!\n\nInstall it via Homebrew:\n\n```bash\nbrew install ripgrep\n```\n\nSearch for text in the codebase:\n\n```bash\nrg \"const Verified\"\n```\n\n### Bundle Analyzer\n\nIn `apps/web`, we've got a bundle analyzer that spills the beans on the size and contents of our production bundles. It's like having X-ray vision for your code!\n\nTo generate this output, run:\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web\nANALYZE=true pnpm build\n```\n\nFire up this command to build the `apps/web` project and watch as three browser windows magically pop open, each showcasing bundle details for node, edge, and client bundles. The client bundle is the superhero for page performance, while all bundles play a vital role in development and build performance.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nWe kindly ask all contributors and team members to follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Think of it as our community's golden rulebook - play nice and keep the good vibes flowing!\n\n## License\n\nThis project is open-sourced under the **AGPL-3.0** license. For all the nitty-gritty details, check out the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file. It's a real page-turner!\n\n## P.S\n\nWe \ud83d\udc96 you to the moon and back! Your support is like a never-ending supply of coffee for our code. Thank you for making Hey the most awesome place in the universe!\n\n\ud83c\udf38\n",
