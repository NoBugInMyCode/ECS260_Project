Run your apps in the terminal *or* a web browser.\n\nTextual's API combines modern Python with the best of developments from the web world, for a lean app development experience.\nDe-coupled components and an advanced [testing](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/testing/) framework ensure you can maintain your app for the long-term.\n\nWant some more examples? See the [examples](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/tree/main/examples) directory.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nAn App to show the current time.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nfrom textual.app import App, ComposeResult\nfrom textual.widgets import Digits\n\n\nclass ClockApp(App):\n    CSS = \"\"\"\n    Screen { align: center middle; }\n    Digits { width: auto; }\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:\n        yield Digits(\"\")\n\n    def on_ready(self) -> None:\n        self.update_clock()\n        self.set_interval(1, self.update_clock)\n\n    def update_clock(self) -> None:\n        clock = datetime.now().time()\n        self.query_one(Digits).update(f\"{clock:%T}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = ClockApp()\n    app.run()\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Textual is an asynchronous framework under the hood. Which means you can integrate your apps with async libraries &mdash; if you want to.\n> If you don't want or need to use async, Textual won't force it on you. \n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://img.spacergif.org/spacer.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"64\"/>\n\n## Widgets\n\nTextual's library of [widgets](https://textual.textualize.io/widget_gallery/) covers everything from buttons, tree controls, data tables, inputs, text areas, and more\u2026\nCombined with a flexible [layout](https://textual.textualize.io/how-to/design-a-layout/) system, you can realize any User Interface you need.\n\nPredefined themes ensure your apps will look good out of the box. \n\n\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n\n  <td>\n    \n  ![buttons](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ac26387-aaa3-41ed-bc00-7d488600343c)\n    \n  </td>\n\n  <td>\n    \n![tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61ccd6e9-97ea-4918-8eda-3ee0f0d3770e)\n    \n  </td>\n  \n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n\n  <td>\n    \n  ![datatables](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e1f9f7a-f965-4901-a114-3c188bd17695)\n    \n  </td>\n\n  <td>\n    \n![inputs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b02aa203-7c37-42da-a1bb-2cb244b7d0d3)\n    \n  </td>\n  \n</tr>\n<tr>\n\n<td>\n\n![listview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/963603bc-aa07-4688-bd24-379962ece871)\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\n![textarea](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd4ba787-5519-40e2-8d86-8224e1b7e506)\n  \n</td>\n\n  \n</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://img.spacergif.org/spacer.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"32\"/>\n\n## Installing\n\nInstall Textual via pip:\n\n```\npip install textual textual-dev\n```\n\nSee [getting started](https://textual.textualize.io/getting_started/) for details.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://img.spacergif.org/spacer.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"32\"/>\n\n## Demo\n\n\nRun the following command to see a little of what Textual can do:\n\n```\npython -m textual\n```\n\nOr try the [textual demo](https://github.com/textualize/textual-demo) *without* installing (requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):\n\n```bash\nuvx --python 3.12 textual-demo\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://img.spacergif.org/spacer.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"32\"/>\n\n## Dev Console\n\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"devtools\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12c60d65-e342-4b2f-9372-bae0459a7552\" />\n\n\nHow do you debug an app in the terminal that is also running in the terminal?\n\nThe `textual-dev` package supplies a dev console that connects to your application from another terminal.\nIn addition to system messages and events, your logged messages and print statements will appear in the dev console.\n\nSee [the guide](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/devtools/) for other helpful tools provided by the `textual-dev` package.\n\n<img src=\"https://img.spacergif.org/spacer.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"32\"/>\n\n## Command Palette\n\n\nTextual apps have a *fuzzy search* command palette.\nHit `ctrl+p` to open the command palette.\n\nIt is easy to extend the command palette with [custom commands](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/command_palette/) for your application.\n\n\n![Command Palette](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94d8ec5d-b668-4033-a5cb-bf820e1b8d60)\n\n<img src=\"https://img.spacergif.org/spacer.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"32\"/>\n\n# Textual \u2764\ufe0f Web\n\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"textual-serve\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a25820fb-87ae-433a-858b-ac3940169242\">\n\n\nTextual apps are equally at home in the browser as they are the terminal. Any Textual app may be served with `textual serve` &mdash; so you can share your creations on the web.\nHere's how to serve the demo app:\n\n```\ntextual serve \"python -m textual\"\n```\n\nIn addition to serving your apps locally, you can serve apps with [Textual Web](https://github.com/Textualize/textual-web).\n\nTextual Web's firewall-busting technology can serve an unlimited number of applications.\n\nSince Textual apps have low system requirements, you can install them anywhere Python also runs. Turning any device into a connected device.\nNo desktop required!\n\n\n<img src=\"https://img.spacergif.org/spacer.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"32\"/>\n\n\n## Join us on Discord\n\nJoin the Textual developers and community on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr).\n",
