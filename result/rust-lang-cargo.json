        "readme": "# Cargo\n\nCargo downloads your Rust project\u2019s dependencies and compiles your project.\n\n**To start using Cargo**, learn more at [The Cargo Book].\n\n**To start developing Cargo itself**, read the [Cargo Contributor Guide].\n\n[The Cargo Book]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/\n[Cargo Contributor Guide]: https://rust-lang.github.io/cargo/contrib/\n\n> The Cargo binary distributed through with Rust is maintained by the Cargo\n> team for use by the wider ecosystem.\n> For all other uses of this crate (as a binary or library) this is maintained\n> by the Cargo team, primarily for use by Cargo and not intended for external\n> use (except as a transitive dependency). This crate may make major changes to\n> its APIs.\n\n## Code Status\n\n[![CI](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=auto-cargo)](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml)\n\nCode documentation: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo/>\n\n## Compiling from Source\n\n### Requirements\n\nCargo requires the following tools and packages to build:\n\n* `cargo` and `rustc`\n* A C compiler [for your platform](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs#compile-time-requirements)\n* `git` (to clone this repository)\n\n**Other requirements:**\n\nThe following are optional based on your platform and needs.\n\n* `pkg-config` \u2014 This is used to help locate system packages, such as `libssl` headers/libraries. This may not be required in all cases, such as using vendored OpenSSL, or on Windows.\n* OpenSSL \u2014 Only needed on Unix-like systems and only if the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature is not used.\n\n  This requires the development headers, which can be obtained from the `libssl-dev` package on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` with apk or yum or the `openssl` package from Homebrew on macOS.\n\n  If using the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature, then a static copy of OpenSSL will be built from source instead of using the system OpenSSL.\n  This may require additional tools such as `perl` and `make`.\n\n  On macOS, common installation directories from Homebrew, MacPorts, or pkgsrc will be checked. Otherwise it will fall back to `pkg-config`.\n\n  On Windows, the system-provided Schannel will be used instead.\n\n  LibreSSL is also supported.\n\n**Optional system libraries:**\n\nThe build will automatically use vendored versions of the following libraries. However, if they are provided by the system and can be found with `pkg-config`, then the system libraries will be used instead:\n\n* [`libcurl`](https://curl.se/libcurl/) \u2014 Used for network transfers.\n* [`libgit2`](https://libgit2.org/) \u2014 Used for fetching git dependencies.\n* [`libssh2`](https://www.libssh2.org/) \u2014 Used for SSH access to git repositories.\n* [`libz`](https://zlib.net/) (aka zlib) \u2014 Used for data compression.\n\nIt is recommended to use the vendored versions as they are the versions that are tested to work with Cargo.\n\n### Compiling\n\nFirst, you'll want to check out this repository\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo.git\ncd cargo\n```\n\nWith `cargo` already installed, you can simply run:\n\n```\ncargo build --release\n```\n\n## Adding new subcommands to Cargo\n\nCargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify\nCargo itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and\na list of known community-developed subcommands.\n\n[third-party-subcommands]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/wiki/Third-party-cargo-subcommands\n\n\n## Releases\n\nCargo releases coincide with Rust releases.\nHigh level release notes are available as part of [Rust's release notes][rel].\nDetailed release notes are available in this repo at [CHANGELOG.md].\n\n[rel]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md\n[CHANGELOG.md]: CHANGELOG.md\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nFound a bug? We'd love to know about it!\n\nPlease report all issues on the GitHub [issue tracker][issues].\n\n[issues]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the **[Cargo Contributor Guide]** for a complete introduction\nto contributing to Cargo.\n\n## License\n\nCargo is primarily distributed under the terms of both the MIT license\nand the Apache License (Version 2.0).\n\nSee [LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) and [LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) for details.\n\n### Third party software\n\nThis product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project\nfor use in the OpenSSL Toolkit (https://www.openssl.org/).\n\nIn binary form, this product includes software that is licensed under the\nterms of the GNU General Public License, version 2, with a linking exception,\nwhich can be obtained from the [upstream repository][1].\n\nSee [LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY](LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY) for details.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2\n\n",
