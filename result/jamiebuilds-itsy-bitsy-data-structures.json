Click here](itsy-bitsy-data-structures.js)\n\nAlso be sure to check out my other code walkthrough:\n[The Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler)\n\n---\n\n### Why should I care?\n\nData Structures might not be the juiciest topic in the world, but they are\nhugely important to growing as an engineer. Knowing data structures don't just\nmake your programs faster and more efficient, but they help you organize your\ncode and your thoughts so that you can build more complicated programs without\na ton of mental overhead.\n\n### But data structures are scary!\n\nYeah, lots of computer science topics are intimidating, and that's largely a\nfault of how they are taught. In this we're going to do a high level pass over\na lot of the key things you need to know in order to dive into them deeper.\nIt's more about introducing you to the shared language of data structures.\n\n### Okay so where do I begin?\n\nAwesome! Head on over to the\n[itsy-bitsy-data-structures.js](itsy-bitsy-data-structures.js) file.\n\n### I'm back, that didn't make sense\n\nOuch, I'm really sorry. I'm planning on doing a lot more work on this to add\ninline annotations. If you want to come back when that's done, you can either\nwatch/star this repo or follow me on\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/thejameskyle) for updates.\n\n---\n\n[![cc-by-4.0](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by/4.0/80x15.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n",
