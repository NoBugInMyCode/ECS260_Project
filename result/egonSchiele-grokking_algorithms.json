These images are available for non-commercial use. If you use an image, please add \"copyright Manning Publications, drawn by adit.io\". You are welcome to use these images in any non-commercial materials (i.e. teaching materials, presentations, etc.)\n\n## Contributing\n\nThanks for wanting to contribute to this repo!\n\nIf you have found a mistake in the book or have a question, please email me as that will be the best way to get a response. My email is listed on my website, adit.io.\nIf you would like to make a change, please go ahead and open a PR with your suggested change. I am quicker at responding to those than I am to issues.\n\nIt takes me a long time to respond to PRs. It's something I'm trying to get better at, but I apologize in advance for how long it will take. I will eventually get to it.\n\nThe contributions that are most useful are:\n- fixing errors in existing code\n- adding examples to new languages\n- modernizing code as the language evolves\n- making code easier to read.\n\nI'm less likely to merge code that involves stylistic changes, and I'm very unlikely to merge PRs that add complex optimizations, as the main purpose of this repo is to have easy to read examples that help people understand concepts.\n\nThanks for contributing and I hope you're enjoying the book!",
