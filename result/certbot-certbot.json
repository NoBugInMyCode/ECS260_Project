Secure communication over the Web relies on HTTPS, which requires the use of a digital certificate that lets browsers verify the identity of web servers (e.g., is that really google.com?). Web servers obtain their certificates from trusted third parties called certificate authorities (CAs). Certbot is an easy-to-use client that fetches a certificate from Let\u2019s Encrypt\u2014an open certificate authority launched by the EFF, Mozilla, and others\u2014and deploys it to a web server.\n\nAnyone who has gone through the trouble of setting up a secure website knows what a hassle getting and maintaining a certificate is. Certbot and Let\u2019s Encrypt can automate away the pain and let you turn on and manage HTTPS with simple commands. Using Certbot and Let's Encrypt is free.\n\n.. _installation:\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\nThe best way to get started is to use our `interactive guide <https://certbot.eff.org>`_. It generates instructions based on your configuration settings. In most cases, you\u2019ll need `root or administrator access <https://certbot.eff.org/faq/#does-certbot-require-root-administrator-privileges>`_ to your web server to run Certbot.\n\nCertbot is meant to be run directly on your web server on the command line, not on your personal computer. If you\u2019re using a hosted service and don\u2019t have direct access to your web server, you might not be able to use Certbot. Check with your hosting provider for documentation about uploading certificates or using certificates issued by Let\u2019s Encrypt.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to this project please read `Developer Guide\n<https://certbot.eff.org/docs/contributing.html>`_.\n\nThis project is governed by `EFF's Public Projects Code of Conduct <https://www.eff.org/pages/eppcode>`_.\n\nLinks\n=====\n\n..
