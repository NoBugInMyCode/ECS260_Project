To scaffold a\nproject run the following:\n\n```sh\ndeno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev\n```\n\nThen navigate to the newly created project folder:\n\n```\ncd deno-fresh-demo\n```\n\nFrom within your project folder, start the development server using the\n`deno task` command:\n\n```\ndeno task start\n```\n\nNow open http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the page. You make\nchanges to the project source code and see them reflected in your browser.\n\nTo deploy the project to the live internet, you can use\n[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy):\n\n1. Push your project to GitHub.\n2. [Create a Deno Deploy project](https://dash.deno.com/new).\n3. [Link](https://deno.com/deploy/docs/projects#enabling) the Deno Deploy\n   project to the **`main.ts`** file in the root of the created repository.\n4. The project will be deployed to a public $project.deno.dev subdomain.\n\nFor a more in-depth getting started guide, visit the\n[Getting Started](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started) page in the Fresh\ndocs.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe appreciate your help! To contribute, please read our\n[contributing instructions](https://deno.com/manual/references/contributing#submitting-a-pr-to-fresh).\n\n## Adding your project to the showcase\n\nIf you feel that your project would be helpful to other Fresh users, please\nconsider putting your project on the\n[showcase](https://fresh.deno.dev/showcase). However, websites that are just for\npromotional purposes may not be listed.\n\nTo take a screenshot, run the following command.\n\n```sh\ndeno task screenshot [url] [your-app-name]\n```\n\nThen add your site to\n[showcase.json](https://github.com/denoland/fresh/blob/main/www/data/showcase.json),\npreferably with source code on GitHub, but not required.\n\n## Badges\n\n![Made with Fresh](./www/static/fresh-badge.svg)\n\n```md\n[![Made with Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/fresh-badge.svg)](https://fresh.deno.dev)\n```\n\n```html\n<a href=\"https://fresh.deno.dev\">\n  <img\n    width=\"197\"\n    height=\"37\"\n    src=\"https://fresh.deno.dev/fresh-badge.svg\"\n    alt=\"Made with Fresh\"\n  />\n</a>\n```\n\n![Made with Fresh(dark)](./www/static/fresh-badge-dark.svg)\n\n```md\n[![Made with Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/fresh-badge-dark.svg)](https://fresh.deno.dev)\n```\n\n```html\n<a href=\"https://fresh.deno.dev\">\n  <img\n    width=\"197\"\n    height=\"37\"\n    src=\"https://fresh.deno.dev/fresh-badge-dark.svg\"\n    alt=\"Made with Fresh\"\n  />\n</a>\n```\n\n## Hashtags\n\nUse the following hashtags in your social media posts that reference Fresh and\nas Topics in the About section of your GitHub repos that contain Fresh code. It\nwill assure maximum visibility for your posts and code, and promote Fresh\ndevelopment ecosystem visibility.\n\n- #denofresh\n- #deno\n\nGithub repo Topics will not include the hash symbol.\n",
