Please switch over to Gymnasium as soon as you're able to do so. If you'd like to read more about the story behind this switch, please check out [this blog post](https://farama.org/Announcing-The-Farama-Foundation).\n\n## Gym\n\nGym is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments compliant with that API. Since its release, Gym's API has become the field standard for doing this.\n\nGym documentation website is at [https://www.gymlibrary.dev/](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/), and you can propose fixes and changes to it [here](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/gym-docs).\n\nGym also has a discord server for development purposes that you can join here: https://discord.gg/nHg2JRN489\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the base Gym library, use `pip install gym`.\n\nThis does not include dependencies for all families of environments (there's a massive number, and some can be problematic to install on certain systems). You can install these dependencies for one family like `pip install gym[atari]` or use `pip install gym[all]` to install all dependencies.\n\nWe support Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 on Linux and macOS. We will accept PRs related to Windows, but do not officially support it.\n\n## API\n\nThe Gym API's API models environments as simple Python `env` classes. Creating environment instances and interacting with them is very simple- here's an example using the \"CartPole-v1\" environment:\n\n```python\nimport gym\nenv = gym.make(\"CartPole-v1\")\nobservation, info = env.reset(seed=42)\n\nfor _ in range(1000):\n    action = env.action_space.sample()\n    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\n\n    if terminated or truncated:\n        observation, info = env.reset()\nenv.close()\n```\n\n## Notable Related Libraries\n\nPlease note that this is an incomplete list, and just includes libraries that the maintainers most commonly point newcommers to when asked for recommendations.\n\n* [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) is a learning library based on the Gym API. It is designed to cater to newer people in the field and provides very good reference implementations.\n* [Tianshou](https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou) is a learning library that's geared towards very experienced users and is design to allow for ease in complex algorithm modifications.\n* [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html) is a learning library that allows for distributed training and inferencing and supports an extraordinarily large number of features throughout the reinforcement learning space.\n* [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) is like Gym, but for environments with multiple agents.\n\n## Environment Versioning\n\nGym keeps strict versioning for reproducibility reasons. All environments end in a suffix like \"\\_v0\".  When changes are made to environments that might impact learning results, the number is increased by one to prevent potential confusion.\n\n## MuJoCo Environments\n\nThe latest \"\\_v4\" and future versions of the MuJoCo environments will no longer depend on `mujoco-py`. Instead `mujoco` will be the required dependency for future gym MuJoCo environment versions. Old gym MuJoCo environment versions that depend on `mujoco-py` will still be kept but unmaintained.\nTo install the dependencies for the latest gym MuJoCo environments use `pip install gym[mujoco]`. Dependencies for old MuJoCo environments can still be installed by `pip install gym[mujoco_py]`. \n\n## Citation\n\nA whitepaper from when Gym just came out is available https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01540, and can be cited with the following bibtex entry:\n\n```\n@misc{1606.01540,\n  Author = {Greg Brockman and Vicki Cheung and Ludwig Pettersson and Jonas Schneider and John Schulman and Jie Tang and Wojciech Zaremba},\n  Title = {OpenAI Gym},\n  Year = {2016},\n  Eprint = {arXiv:1606.01540},\n}\n```\n\n## Release Notes\n\nThere used to be release notes for all the new Gym versions here. New release notes are being moved to [releases page](https://github.com/openai/gym/releases) on GitHub, like most other libraries do. Old notes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/31be35ecd460f670f0c4b653a14c9996b7facc6c/README.rst).\n",
