If you want a quick solution choose this.\n-  [words_dictionary.json](words_dictionary.json) contains all the words from words_alpha.txt as json format. \nIf you are using Python, you can easily load this file and use it as a dictionary for faster performance. All the words are assigned with 1 in the dictionary.\n\nSee [read_english_dictionary.py](read_english_dictionary.py) for example usage.\n",
