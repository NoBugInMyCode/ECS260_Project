It is one of the upstream projects for [Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-platform).\n\nTo install AWX, please view the [Install guide](./INSTALL.md).\n\nTo learn more about using AWX, view the [AWX docs site](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/awx/en/latest/).\n\nThe AWX Project Frequently Asked Questions can be found [here](https://www.ansible.com/awx-project-faq).\n\nThe AWX logos and branding assets are covered by [our trademark guidelines](https://github.com/ansible/awx-logos/blob/master/TRADEMARKS.md).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n- Refer to the [Contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started developing, testing, and building AWX.\n- All code submissions are made through pull requests against the `devel` branch.\n- All contributors must use `git commit --signoff` for any commit to be merged and agree that usage of `--signoff` constitutes agreement with the terms of [DCO 1.1](./DCO_1_1.md)\n- Take care to make sure no merge commits are in the submission, and use `git rebase` vs. `git merge` for this reason.\n- If submitting a large code change, it's a good idea to join discuss via the [Ansible Forum](https://forum.ansible.com/tag/awx). This helps everyone know what's going on, and it also helps save time and effort if the community decides some changes are needed.\n\nReporting Issues\n----------------\n\nIf you're experiencing a problem that you feel is a bug in AWX or have ideas for improving AWX, we encourage you to open an issue and share your feedback. But before opening a new issue, we ask that you please take a look at our [Issues guide](./ISSUES.md).\n\nCode of Conduct\n---------------\n\nWe require all of our community members and contributors to adhere to the [Ansible code of conduct](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html). If you have questions or need assistance, please reach out to our community team at [codeofconduct@ansible.com](mailto:codeofconduct@ansible.com)\n\nGet Involved\n------------\n\nWe welcome your feedback and ideas via the [Ansible Forum](https://forum.ansible.com/tag/awx).\n\nFor a full list of all the ways to talk with the Ansible Community, see the [AWX Communication guide](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/awx/en/latest/contributor/communication.html).\n",
