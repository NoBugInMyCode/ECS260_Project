Today [Marp team] is focusing into [Marp Next] project, the brand-new presentation ecosystem for the future.\n\n_[See more details in our blog post.](https://marp.app/blog/the-story-of-marp-next)_\n\n## Why?\n\nWe had kept publishing app for stuck users that are thinking Marp Next is too complex.\n\nBut recently, we received [a serious security report for outdated app](https://github.com/yhatt/marp/issues/276). **_By opening a malicious Markdown, an attacker can execute arbitrary code through remote._** We are responsible for saving users from malicious.\n\nIf you are currently using Marp app, **_please stop using as soon as possible_** and migrate into well-maintained Marp Next tools.\n\n## [Marp Next] tools\n\n[Marp Next] is not complex! Simply you can just use either one if you want to create slide deck.\n\n### [Marp for VS Code]&nbsp;(Recommended)\n\n**[Marp for VS Code]**, an extension for [Visual Studio Code], is the best alternative for desktop app users. There are key features inherited from the classic Marp app.\n\n- Live preview\n- Export to PDF, HTML, and PPTX (via [Marp CLI])\n- Support built-in 3 themes and custom theme CSS\n\n### [Marp CLI]\n\n**[Marp CLI]** is simple but powerful CLI converter from Marp Markdown into PDF, HTML, PPTX, and images. You can use it if you don't want GUI editor.\n\nI also have [an example repository](https://github.com/yhatt/marp-cli-example) to automate generating slide deck and serving through [Marp CLI] + [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/).\n\n## Migrate Markdown\n\nMarp Next is losing Markdown compatibility with classic app, but your slide would keep appearance as before just by some changes in most cases. Please see [our blog post](https://marp.app/blog/the-story-of-marp-next#migration-plan) for details.\n\n## Thanks\n\nThanks for a lot of users / contributors of desktop app. Marp has changed my life as developer without doubt, and I've learned a lot from many feedbacks.\n\nNow [Marp Next] project is evolving built on them. I hope you like it too.\n\n---\n\n_\u2014 Yuki Hattori ([@yhatt](https://github.com/yhatt))_\n\n[marp next]: https://marp.app/\n[marp team]: https://github.com/marp-team/\n[marp for vs code]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode\n[marp cli]: https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli\n[visual studio code]: https://code.visualstudio.com\n",
