The website is on the [Apktool docs branch](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/tree/docs).**\n\n[![CI](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/actions/workflows/test.yml)\n[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n\nApktool is a tool for reverse engineering third-party, closed, binary, Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after making some modifications; it makes it possible to debug smali code step-by-step. It also makes working with apps easier thanks to project-like file structure and automation of some repetitive tasks such as building apk, etc.\n\nApktool is **NOT** intended for piracy and other non-legal uses. It could be used for localizing and adding features, adding support for custom platforms, and other GOOD purposes. Just try to be fair with the authors of an app, that you use and probably like.\n\n#### Support\n- [Project Page](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)\n- [#apktool on libera.chat](https://web.libera.chat/)\n\n#### Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIf you discover a security vulnerability within Apktool, please send an e-mail to Connor Tumbleson at connor.tumbleson(at)gmail.com.
