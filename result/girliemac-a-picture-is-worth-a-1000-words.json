I am repeatedly asked where to get the original images, especially from people who saw some of my works out of context on some social media, so I decided to put them all together on one GitHub repo.\n\nHere are some of the latest digitally created hand-drawn doodles, as well as photos of analog ones.\n\nAll my doodles are under Creative a Commons license, so please share with attributions. And I definitely don't want you to NFT them without my permission (and I won't permit you because you don't own them. They are open-sourced to be freely available for educational purpose only!)\n\nEnjoy \ud83c\udf3a\n\n---\n## Generative AI\n[/generative-ai](/generative-ai)\n\n```\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1misc\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1png\n     \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4chatgpt.png\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4GenAI-doodle-youtube.png\n     \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4...\n```\n1.

Although this is *not* doodling, I thought it was worth mentioning here!\n\nAll HTTP Cats are now hosted at [HTTP.cat](https://http.cat) because the domain name is awesome.\n\nAll images (except a few) are originally created by me a decade ago!

I created the zine (as physical printed books) to be distributed at Slack-sponsored events and conferences but never got fully approved.
