        "readme": "# Cloud Functions for Firebase Sample Library\n\nThis repository contains a collection of samples showcasing some typical uses of [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/features/functions).\n\nSamples are available for the **Node** (2nd gen), **Python** (2nd gen), and Node (1st gen). \n\n> Note: Python support in Cloud Functions for Firebase is a public preview. This means that the functionality might change in backward-incompatible ways. A preview release is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy and may receive limited or no support.\n\n### What's Cloud Functions for Firebase?\n\nCloud Functions is a hosted, private, and scalable Node.js environment where you can run JavaScript or Python code. [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/features/functions) integrates the Firebase platform by letting you write code that responds to events and invokes functionality exposed by other Firebase features.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n> All samples require the Blaze pay-as-you-go billing plan to deploy. Learn more about [pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing#cloud-functions).\n\nTo learn how to get started with Cloud Functions for Firebase by having a look at the [Getting Started Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started), trying the [quickstart samples](/Node/quickstarts) and looking at [the documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).\n\n<a name=\"quickstarts\"></a>\n## Quickstarts\n\nMinimal samples for each Cloud Functions trigger type.\n\n### Quickstart: Uppercaser for Firestore\n\n- [Node 2nd gen](/Node/quickstarts/uppercase-firestore/)\n- [Python](/Python/quickstarts/uppercase-firestore/)\n- [Node 1st gen](/Node-1st-gen/quickstarts/uppercase-firestore/)\n\nThis quickstart sample demonstrates using **Cloud Functions** triggered by **Firestore events**. The function transforms message text written to Firestore to uppercase.\n\n### Quickstart: Add numbers and sanitize text with callable functions\n\n- [Node 2nd gen](/Node/quickstarts/callable-functions/)\n- [Python](/Python/quickstarts/callable-functions)\n- [Node 1st gen](/Node-1st-gen/quickstarts/callable-functions/)\n\n### HTTPS trigger quickstart: Time Server\n\n- [Node 2nd gen](/Node/quickstarts/https-time-server/)\n- [Python](/Python/quickstarts/https-time-server/)\n- [Node 1st gen](/Node-1st-gen/quickstarts/https-time-server/)\n\nThis quickstart sample demonstrates using **Cloud Functions** triggered by **HTTPS requests**. The function returns the current server time and allows for date time formatting.\n\n### Quickstart: Uppercaser for Realtime Database\n\n- [Node 2nd gen](/Node/quickstarts/uppercase-rtdb/)\n- [Python](/Python/quickstarts/uppercase-rtdb/)\n- [Node 1st gen](/Node-1st-gen/quickstarts/uppercase-rtdb/)\n\nThis quickstart sample demonstrates using **Cloud Functions** triggered by **Realtime Database events**. The function transforms message text written to Realtime Database to uppercase.\n\n### Hosting triggered HTTPS function quickstart: Big Ben\n\n- [Node 1st gen](/Node-1st-gen/quickstarts/big-ben/)\n\nThis quickstart demonstrates using **Cloud Functions** with an HTTPS trigger that's triggered through a Firebase Hosting URL.
