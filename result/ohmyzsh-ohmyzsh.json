If not pre-installed (run `zsh --version` to confirm), check the following wiki instructions here:\n  [Installing ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)\n- `curl` or `wget` should be installed\n- `git` should be installed (recommended v2.4.11 or higher)\n\n### Basic Installation\n\nOh My Zsh is installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the\ncommand-line with either `curl`, `wget` or another similar tool.\n\n| Method    | Command                                                                                           |\n| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **curl**  | `sh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"` |\n| **wget**  | `sh -c \"$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"`   |\n| **fetch** | `sh -c \"$(fetch -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"` |\n\nAlternatively, the installer is also mirrored outside GitHub. Using this URL instead may be required if you're\nin a country like China or India (for certain ISPs), that blocks `raw.githubusercontent.com`:\n\n| Method    | Command                                           |\n| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------ |\n| **curl**  | `sh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://install.ohmyz.sh/)\"` |\n| **wget**  | `sh -c \"$(wget -O- https://install.ohmyz.sh/)\"`   |\n| **fetch** | `sh -c \"$(fetch -o - https://install.ohmyz.sh/)\"` |\n\n_Note that any previous `.zshrc` will be renamed to `.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh`. After installation, you can move\nthe configuration you want to preserve into the new `.zshrc`._\n\n#### Manual Inspection\n\nIt's a good idea to inspect the install script from projects you don't yet know. You can do that by\ndownloading the install script first, looking through it so everything looks normal, then running it:\n\n```sh\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh\nsh install.sh\n```\n\nIf the above URL times out or otherwise fails, you may have to substitute the URL for\n`https://install.ohmyz.sh` to be able to get the script.\n\n## Using Oh My Zsh\n\n### Plugins\n\nOh My Zsh comes with a shitload of plugins for you to take advantage of. You can take a look in the\n[plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins) directory and/or the\n[wiki](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins) to see what's currently available.\n\n#### Enabling Plugins\n\nOnce you spot a plugin (or several) that you'd like to use with Oh My Zsh, you'll need to enable them in the\n`.zshrc` file. You'll find the zshrc file in your `$HOME` directory. Open it with your favorite text editor\nand you'll see a spot to list all the plugins you want to load.\n\n```sh\nvi ~/.zshrc\n```\n\nFor example, this might begin to look like this:\n\n```sh\nplugins=(\n  git\n  bundler\n  dotenv\n  macos\n  rake\n  rbenv\n  ruby\n)\n```\n\n_Note that the plugins are separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, new lines...). **Do not** use commas between\nthem or it will break._\n\n#### Using Plugins\n\nEach built-in plugin includes a **README**, documenting it. This README should show the aliases (if the plugin\nadds any) and extra goodies that are included in that particular plugin.\n\n### Themes\n\nWe'll admit it. Early in the Oh My Zsh world, we may have gotten a bit too theme happy. We have over one\nhundred and fifty themes now bundled. Most of them have\n[screenshots](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes) on the wiki (We are working on updating this!).\nCheck them out!\n\n#### Selecting A Theme\n\n_Robby's theme is the default one. It's not the fanciest one. It's not the simplest one. It's just the right\none (for him)._\n\nOnce you find a theme that you'd like to use, you will need to edit the `~/.zshrc` file. You'll see an\nenvironment variable (all caps) in there that looks like:\n\n```sh\nZSH_THEME=\"robbyrussell\"\n```\n\nTo use a different theme, simply change the value to match the name of your desired theme. For example:\n\n```sh\nZSH_THEME=\"agnoster\" # (this is one of the fancy ones)\n# see https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster\n```\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n> [!NOTE]\n> You will many times see screenshots for a zsh theme, and try it out, and find that it doesn't look the same for you.\n>\n> This is because many themes require installing a [Powerline Font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) or a\n> [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) in order to render properly. Without them, these themes\n> will render weird prompt symbols. Check out\n> [the FAQ](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/FAQ#i-have-a-weird-character-in-my-prompt) for more\n> information.\n>\n> Also, beware that themes only control what your prompt looks like. This is, the text you see before or after\n> your cursor, where you'll type your commands. Themes don't control things such as the colors of your\n> terminal window (known as _color scheme_) or the font of your terminal. These are settings that you can\n> change in your terminal emulator. For more information, see\n> [what is a zsh theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/FAQ#what-is-a-zsh-theme).\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\nOpen up a new terminal window and your prompt should look something like this:\n\n![Agnoster theme](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/6316862/70f58fb6-ba03-11e4-82c9-c083bf9a6574.png)\n\nIn case you did not find a suitable theme for your needs, please have a look at the wiki for\n[more of them](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/External-themes).\n\nIf you're feeling feisty, you can let the computer select one randomly for you each time you open a new\nterminal window.\n\n```sh\nZSH_THEME=\"random\" # (...please let it be pie... please be some pie..)\n```\n\nAnd if you want to pick random theme from a list of your favorite themes:\n\n```sh\nZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=(\n  \"robbyrussell\"\n  \"agnoster\"\n)\n```\n\nIf you only know which themes you don't like, you can add them similarly to an ignored list:\n\n```sh\nZSH_THEME_RANDOM_IGNORED=(pygmalion tjkirch_mod)\n```\n\n### FAQ\n\nIf you have some more questions or issues, you might find a solution in our\n[FAQ](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/FAQ).\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\nIf you're the type that likes to get their hands dirty, these sections might resonate.\n\n### Advanced Installation\n\nSome users may want to manually install Oh My Zsh, or change the default path or other settings that the\ninstaller accepts (these settings are also documented at the top of the install script).\n\n#### Custom Directory\n\nThe default location is `~/.oh-my-zsh` (hidden in your home directory, you can access it with\n`cd ~/.oh-my-zsh`)\n\nIf you'd like to change the install directory with the `ZSH` environment variable, either by running\n`export ZSH=/your/path` before installing, or by setting it before the end of the install pipeline like this:\n\n```sh\nZSH=\"$HOME/.dotfiles/oh-my-zsh\" sh install.sh\n```\n\n#### Unattended Install\n\nIf you're running the Oh My Zsh install script as part of an automated install, you can pass the\n`--unattended` flag to the `install.sh` script. This will have the effect of not trying to change the default\nshell, and it also won't run `zsh` when the installation has finished.\n\n```sh\nsh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)\" \"\" --unattended\n```\n\nIf you're in China, India, or another country that blocks `raw.githubusercontent.com`, you may have to\nsubstitute the URL for `https://install.ohmyz.sh` for it to install.\n\n#### Installing From A Forked Repository\n\nThe install script also accepts these variables to allow the installation of a different repository:\n\n- `REPO` (default: `ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh`): this takes the form of `owner/repository`. If you set this variable,\n  the installer will look for a repository at `https://github.com/{owner}/{repository}`.\n\n- `REMOTE` (default: `https://github.com/${REPO}.git`): this is the full URL of the git repository clone. You\n  can use this setting if you want to install from a fork that is not on GitHub (GitLab, Bitbucket...) or if\n  you want to clone with SSH instead of HTTPS (`git@github.com:user/project.git`).\n\n  _NOTE: it's incompatible with setting the `REPO` variable. This setting will take precedence._\n\n- `BRANCH` (default: `master`): you can use this setting if you want to change the default branch to be\n  checked out when cloning the repository. This might be useful for testing a Pull Request, or if you want to\n  use a branch other than `master`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```sh\nREPO=apjanke/oh-my-zsh BRANCH=edge sh install.sh\n```\n\n#### Manual Installation\n\n##### 1. Clone The Repository <!-- omit in toc -->\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh\n```\n\n##### 2. _Optionally_, Backup Your Existing `~/.zshrc` File <!-- omit in toc -->\n\n```sh\ncp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig\n```\n\n##### 3. Create A New Zsh Configuration File <!-- omit in toc -->\n\nYou can create a new zsh config file by copying the template that we have included for you.\n\n```sh\ncp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n##### 4. Change Your Default Shell <!-- omit in toc -->\n\n```sh\nchsh -s $(which zsh)\n```\n\nYou must log out from your user session and log back in to see this change.\n\n##### 5. Initialize Your New Zsh Configuration <!-- omit in toc -->\n\nOnce you open up a new terminal window, it should load zsh with Oh My Zsh's configuration.\n\n### Installation Problems\n\nIf you have any hiccups installing, here are a few common fixes.\n\n- You _might_ need to modify your `PATH` in `~/.zshrc` if you're not able to find some commands after\n  switching to `oh-my-zsh`.\n- If you installed manually or changed the install location, check the `ZSH` environment variable in\n  `~/.zshrc`.\n\n### Custom Plugins And Themes\n\nIf you want to override any of the default behaviors, just add a new file (ending in `.zsh`) in the `custom/`\ndirectory.\n\nIf you have many functions that go well together, you can put them as a `XYZ.plugin.zsh` file in the\n`custom/plugins/` directory and then enable this plugin.\n\nIf you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with Oh My Zsh, create a plugin of the\nsame name in the `custom/plugins/` directory and it will be loaded instead of the one in `plugins/`.\n\n### Enable GNU ls In macOS And freeBSD Systems\n\n<a name=\"enable-gnu-ls\"></a>\n\nThe default behaviour in Oh My Zsh is to use BSD `ls` in macOS and FreeBSD systems. If GNU `ls` is installed\n(as `gls` command), you can choose to use it instead. To do it, you can use zstyle-based config before\nsourcing `oh-my-zsh.sh`:\n\n```zsh\nzstyle ':omz:lib:theme-and-appearance' gnu-ls yes\n```\n\n_Note: this is not compatible with `DISABLE_LS_COLORS=true`_\n\n### Skip Aliases\n\n<a name=\"remove-directories-aliases\"></a>\n\nIf you want to skip default Oh My Zsh aliases (those defined in `lib/*` files) or plugin aliases, you can use\nthe settings below in your `~/.zshrc` file, **before Oh My Zsh is loaded**. Note that there are many different\nways to skip aliases, depending on your needs.\n\n```sh\n# Skip all aliases, in lib files and enabled plugins\nzstyle ':omz:*' aliases no\n\n# Skip all aliases in lib files\nzstyle ':omz:lib:*' aliases no\n# Skip only aliases defined in the directories.zsh lib file\nzstyle ':omz:lib:directories' aliases no\n\n# Skip all plugin aliases\nzstyle ':omz:plugins:*' aliases no\n# Skip only the aliases from the git plugin\nzstyle ':omz:plugins:git' aliases no\n```\n\nYou can combine these in other ways taking into account that more specific scopes take precedence:\n\n```sh\n# Skip all plugin aliases, except for the git plugin\nzstyle ':omz:plugins:*' aliases no\nzstyle ':omz:plugins:git' aliases yes\n```\n\nA previous version of this feature was using the setting below, which has been removed:\n\n```sh\nzstyle ':omz:directories' aliases no\n```\n\nInstead, you can now use the following:\n\n```sh\nzstyle ':omz:lib:directories' aliases no\n```\n\n#### Notice <!-- omit in toc -->\n\n> This feature is currently in a testing phase and it may be subject to change in the future. It is also not\n> currently compatible with plugin managers such as zpm or zinit, which don't source the init script\n> (`oh-my-zsh.sh`) where this feature is implemented in.\n\n> It is also not currently aware of \"aliases\" that are defined as functions. Example of such are `gccd`,\n> `ggf`, or `ggl` functions from the git plugin.\n\n### Async git prompt\n\nAsync prompt functions are an experimental feature (included on April 3, 2024) that allows Oh My Zsh to render\nprompt information asynchronously. This can improve prompt rendering performance, but it might not work well\nwith some setups. We hope that's not an issue, but if you're seeing problems with this new feature, you can\nturn it off by setting the following in your .zshrc file, before Oh My Zsh is sourced:\n\n```sh\nzstyle ':omz:alpha:lib:git' async-prompt no\n```\n\nIf your problem is that the git prompt just stopped appearing, you can try to force it setting the following\nconfiguration before `oh-my-zsh.sh` is sourced. If it still does not work, please open an issue with your\ncase.\n\n```sh\nzstyle ':omz:alpha:lib:git' async-prompt force\n```\n\n## Getting Updates\n\nBy default, you will be prompted to check for updates every 2 weeks. You can choose other update modes by\nadding a line to your `~/.zshrc` file, **before Oh My Zsh is loaded**:\n\n1. Automatic update without confirmation prompt:\n\n   ```sh\n   zstyle ':omz:update' mode auto\n   ```\n\n2. Just offer a reminder every few days, if there are updates available:\n\n   ```sh\n   zstyle ':omz:update' mode reminder\n   ```\n\n3. To disable automatic updates entirely:\n\n   ```sh\n   zstyle ':omz:update' mode disabled\n   ```\n\nNOTE: you can control how often Oh My Zsh checks for updates with the following setting:\n\n```sh\n# This will check for updates every 7 days\nzstyle ':omz:update' frequency 7\n# This will check for updates every time you open the terminal (not recommended)\nzstyle ':omz:update' frequency 0\n```\n\n### Updates Verbosity\n\nYou can also limit the update verbosity with the following settings:\n\n```sh\nzstyle ':omz:update' verbose default # default update prompt\n\nzstyle ':omz:update' verbose minimal # only few lines\n\nzstyle ':omz:update' verbose silent # only errors\n```\n\n### Manual Updates\n\nIf you'd like to update at any point in time (maybe someone just released a new plugin and you don't want to\nwait a week?) you just need to run:\n\n```sh\nomz update\n```\n\nMagic! \ud83c\udf89\n\n## Uninstalling Oh My Zsh\n\nOh My Zsh isn't for everyone. We'll miss you, but we want to make this an easy breakup.\n\nIf you want to uninstall `oh-my-zsh`, just run `uninstall_oh_my_zsh` from the command-line. It will remove\nitself and revert your previous `bash` or `zsh` configuration.\n\n## How Do I Contribute To Oh My Zsh?\n\nBefore you participate in our delightful community, please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nI'm far from being a [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) expert and suspect there are many ways to improve \u2013 if you\nhave ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send\npull requests!\n\nWe also need people to test out pull requests.
