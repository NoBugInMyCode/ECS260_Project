There are hundreds of nice charting libraries already\nout there, but they are either:\n\n- use the wrong technologies for illustration (canvas) \n- weighs hundreds of kilobytes\n- are not flexible enough while keeping the configuration simple\n- are not friendly to designers\n- more annoying things\n\nThat's why we started Chartist and our goal is to solve all of the above issues.\n\n<hr />\n<a href=\"#quickstart\">Quickstart</a>\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n<a href=\"#what-is-it-made-for\">What is it made for?</a>\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n<a href=\"https://chartist.dev/docs/whats-new-in-v1\">What's new in v1?</a>\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n<a href=\"https://chartist.dev/\">Docs</a>\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n<a href=\"https://chartist.dev/examples\">Examples</a>\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n<a href=\"#contribution\">Contribution</a>\n<hr />\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstall this library using your favorite package manager:\n\n```sh\npnpm add chartist\n# or\nyarn add chartist\n# or\nnpm i chartist\n```\n\nThen, just import chart you want and use it:\n\n```js\nimport { BarChart } from 'chartist';\n\nnew BarChart('#chart', {\n  labels: ['W1', 'W2', 'W3', 'W4', 'W5', 'W6', 'W7', 'W8', 'W9', 'W10'],\n  series: [\n    [1, 2, 4, 8, 6, -2, -1, -4, -6, -2]\n  ]\n}, {\n  high: 10,\n  low: -10,\n  axisX: {\n    labelInterpolationFnc: (value, index) => (index % 2 === 0 ? value : null)\n  }\n});\n```\n\n<br />\n\nNeed an API to fetch data? Consider [Cube](https://cube.dev/?ref=eco-chartist), an open-source API for data apps.\n\n<br />\n\n[![supported by Cube](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/986756/154330861-d79ab8ec-aacb-4af8-9e17-1b28f1eccb01.svg)](https://cube.dev/?ref=eco-chartist)\n\n## What is it made for?\n\nChartist's goal is to provide a simple, lightweight and unintrusive library to responsively craft charts on your website. \nIt's important to understand that one of the main intentions of Chartist is to rely on standards rather than providing \nit's own solution to a problem which is already solved by those standards. We need to leverage the power of browsers \ntoday and say good bye to the idea of solving all problems ourselves.\n\nChartist works with inline-SVG and therefore leverages the power of the DOM to provide parts of its functionality. This \nalso means that Chartist does not provide it's own event handling, labels, behaviors or anything else that can just be \ndone with plain HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The single and only responsibility of Chartist is to help you drawing \"Simple \nresponsive Charts\" using inline-SVG in the DOM, CSS to style and JavaScript to provide an API for configuring your charts.\n\n## Plugins\n\nComing soon.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>For v0.11</summary>\n\nSome features aren't right for the core product\nbut there is a great set of plugins available\nwhich add features like:\n\n* [Axis labels](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/plugins.html#axis-title-plugin)\n* [Tooltips at data points](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/plugins.html#tooltip-plugin)\n* [Coloring above/below a threshold](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/plugins.html#threshold-plugin)\n\nand more.\n\nSee all the plugins [here](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/plugins.html).\n\n</details>\n\n## Contribution\n\nWe are looking for people who share the idea of having a simple, flexible charting library that is responsive and uses\nmodern and future-proof technologies. The goal of this project is to create a responsive charting library where developers\nhave their joy in using it and designers love it because of the designing flexibility they have. Please contribute\nto the project if you like the idea and the concept and help us to bring nice looking responsive open-source charts\nto the masses.\n\nContribute if you like the Chartist Guy!\n",
