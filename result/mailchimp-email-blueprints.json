They include template language elements that make them customizable when imported into a MailChimp account, as well as merge tags that will generate dynamic content when sent through MailChimp. Not a MailChimp user? You can [sign up free](http://www.mailchimp.com/signup) or simply strip out merge tags and use these templates to send through any system.\n\nFor clarification on the coding practices shown in these emails, or for general HTML email knowledge, visit MailChimp's [HTML Email Reference](http://templates.mailchimp.com).\n\nContents\n--------\n\n**/modular-template-patterns** contains a single template built out of modular blocks of common design patterns.\n\n**/responsive-templates** contains a collection of responsive / mobile-friendly email templates with various layouts.\n\n**/templates** contains a collection of fixed-width email templates with various layouts.\n\nResponsive Templates & CSS Inlining\n-----------------------------------\n\nWhen inlining the CSS in the responsive templates, be sure **not** to include the styles within the media query; they should remain in the head element of the email. The MailChimp app and [external CSS inliner](http://beaker.mailchimp.com/inline-css) both inline the CSS correctly, but many services may not.\n\n![Bitdeli](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/mailchimp/Email-Blueprints/trend.png)\n",
