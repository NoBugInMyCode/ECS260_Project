Designers can create stunning designs, interactive prototypes, design systems at scale, while developers enjoy ready-to-use code and make their workflow easy and fast. And all of this with no handoff drama.\n\nPenpot is available on browser and [self host](https://penpot.app/self-host). It\u2019s web-based and works with open standards (SVG, CSS and HTML). And last but not least, it\u2019s free! \n\nPenpot\u2019s latest [huge release 2.0](https://penpot.app/dev-diaries), takes the platform to a whole new level. This update introduces the ground-breaking [CSS Grid Layout feature](https://penpot.app/penpot-2.0), a complete UI redesign, a new Components system, and much more. Plus, it's faster and more accessible. \n\n\n\ud83c\udf87 **Penpot Fest** is our design, code & Open Source event. Check out the highlights from [Penpot Fest 2023 edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOpLZaK5mDc)!\n\n## Table of contents ##\n\n- [Why Penpot](#why-penpot)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Community](#community)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Resources](#resources)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Why Penpot ##\n\nPenpot expresses designs as code. Designers can do their best work and see it will be beautifully implemented by developers in a two-way collaboration.\n\n### Plugin system ###\n[Penpot plugins](https://penpot.app/penpothub/plugins) let you expand the platform's capabilities, give you the flexibility to integrate it with other apps, and design custom solutions. \n\n### Designed for developers ###\nPenpot was built to serve both designers and developers and create a fluid design-code process. You have the choice to enjoy real-time collaboration or play \"solo\".\n\n### Inspect mode ###\nWork with ready-to-use code and make your workflow easy and fast. The inspect tab gives instant access to SVG, CSS and HTML code.\n\n### Self host your own instance ###\nProvide your team or organization with a completely owned collaborative design tool. Use Penpot's cloud service or deploy your own Penpot server.\n\n### Integrations ###\nPenpot offers integration into the development toolchain, thanks to its support for webhooks and an API accessible through access tokens.\n\n### What\u2019s great for design ###\nWith Penpot you can design libraries to share and reuse; turn design elements into components and tokens to allow reusability and scalability; and build realistic user flows and interactions.\n\n<br />\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://img.plasmic.app/img-optimizer/v1/img?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.plasmic.app%2Fimg-optimizer%2Fv1%2Fimg%2F9dd677c36afb477e9666ccd1d3f009ad.png\" alt=\"Open Source\" style=\"width: 65%;\">\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n## Getting started ##\n\n### Install with Elestio ###\nPenpot is the only design & prototype platform that is deployment agnostic. You can use it or deploy it anywhere.\n\nLearn how to install it with Elestio and Docker, or other options on [our website](https://penpot.app/self-host).\n<br />\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://site-assets.plasmic.app/2168cf524dd543caeff32384eb9ea0a1.svg\" alt=\"Open Source\" style=\"width: 65%;\">\n</p>\n<br />\n\n## Community ##\n\nWe love the Open Source software community.
