When you build the documentation, it will be placed in the `docs/build` folder.\nIt is written in a combination of [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) and [MyST Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/).\n\n## Build the documentation locally\n\nThere are a few ways to build the documentation; see below for instructions:\n\n### Build the documentation automatically with `nox`\n\nThe easiest way to build the documentation locally is by using the [`nox` command line tool](https://nox.thea.codes/). This tool makes it easy to automate commands in a repository, and we have included a `docs` command to quickly install the dependencies and build the documentation.\n\nTo build and preview the site locally, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clone this repository**.\n\n   ```console\n   $ git clone https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter\n   $ cd jupyter\n   ```\n2. **Install `nox`**\n\n   ```console\n   $ pip install nox\n   ```\n3. **Run the `docs` command**\n\n   ```console\n   $ nox -s docs\n   ```\n\nThis will install the needed dependencies in a virtual environment using `pip`.\nIt will then place the documentation in the `docs/build/html` folder.\nYou may explore these HTML files in order to preview the site.\n\n#### Create a live server to automatically preview changes\n\nThere is another `nox` command that will do the above, and also create a live server that watches your source files for changes, and auto-builds the website any time a change is made.\n\nTo start this live server, use the following `nox` command:\n\n```console\n$ nox -s docs-live\n```\n\nWhen the build is finished, go to the URL that is displayed. It should show a live preview of your documentation.\n\nTo stop serving the website, press **`Ctrl`**-`C` in your terminal\n\n### Build the documentation manually\n\nTo build the documentation manually, follow these steps:\n\nFirst, install [the `miniconda` Python distribution](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).\n\nNext, navigate to the `/docs` directory and create a `conda` environment:\n\n```bash\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n```\n\nActivate the environment:\n\n```bash\nsource activate jupyter_docs\n```\n\n**Build the docs** using Sphinx with the following commands:\n\n```bash\nmake clean\nmake html\n```\n\nThe docs will be built in `build/html`. They can be viewed by opening `build/html/index.html` or starting an HTTP server and navigating to `0.0.0.0:8000` in your web browser.\n\n```bash\npython3 -m http.server\n```\n\n## Releasing the jupyter metapackage\n\nAnyone with push access to this repo can make a release\nof the Jupyter metapackage (this happens very rarely).\nWe use [tbump][] to publish releases.\n\ntbump updates version numbers and publishes the `git tag` of the version.\n[Our GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/actions)\nthen build the releases and publish them to PyPI.\n\nThe steps involved:\n\n1. Install tbump: `pip install tbump`\n2. Tag and publish the release `tbump $NEW_VERSION`.\n\nThat's it!\n\n[tbump]: https://github.com/your-tools/tbump\n",
