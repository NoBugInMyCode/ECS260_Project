If your system\ndoes not have OpenSSL, please get it from <https://www.openssl.org> or\nanother source. You do not have to build OpenSSL yourself - a binary\ndistribution is fine. For example, via Debian APT:\n\n```\n$ apt-get install openssl libssl-dev\n```\n\nOn macOS, the easiest way to install OpenSSL is via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):\n\n```\n$ brew install openssl\n```\n\nThe easiest way to install OpenSSL on Windows is to use a binary\n(prebuild) release, for example the one from Shining Light\nProductions that comes with a\n[Windows installer](https://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).\nOpenSSL can also be installed via the `vcpkg` package manager.\n\nOn Windows, POCO can also use the native Windows TLS APIs (SChannel).\n\n### Installing All Dependencies (Linux and macOS)\n\nAll dependencies can be installed with the following commands:\n\n#### Debian Linux (including Ubuntu and Raspbian)\n\n```\n$ sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y install git g++ make cmake libssl-dev libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev\n```\n\n#### RedHat Linux\n\n```\n$ sudo yum install -y git gcc-c++ make cmake3 openssl-devel mysql-devel postgresql-devel \n```\n\n#### macOS (with Homebrew)\n\n```\n$ brew install cmake openssl mysql-client libpq\n```\n\n### Building with CMake (Linux, macOS, Windows)\n\n[CMake](https://cmake.org) (version 3.15 or newer) is the recommended build system for\nbuilding the POCO C++ Libraries.\n\n```\n$ git clone -b main https://github.com/pocoproject/poco.git\n$ cd poco\n$ mkdir cmake-build\n$ cd cmake-build\n$ cmake ..\n$ cmake --build . --config Release\n```\n\nOn macOS, it's necessary to tell CMake where to find the OpenSSL headers\nand libraries by setting the `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` CMake variable.\nFor example, if OpenSSL has been installed with Homebrew,\nthe `cmake` invocation becomes:\n\n```\n$ cmake .. -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3\n```\n\nSimilarly, the locations of other external libraries can be specified:\n\n```\n$ cmake .. -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3 -DMYSQL_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client -DPostgreSQL_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq\n```\n\nOther common ways of building with CMake (e.g., `cmake-gui`) will also work.\n\nThere are also a number of project-specific CMake variables that can be changed.\n\n\n#### Cross-Compiling\n\nWith a proper CMake toolchain file (specified via the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` CMake variable),\nthe POCO C++ Libraries can be cross-compiled for embedded Linux systems:\n\n```\n$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/mytoolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/target\n```\n\n\n#### Installing\n\nThe POCO C++ Libraries headers and libraries can be optionally be installed by building the `install` target.\n\n```\n$ sudo cmake --build . --target install\n```\n\nThe default install location is `/usr/local/` on Linux and macOS and\n`C:\\Program Files (x64)\\` on Windows and can be overridden by setting\nthe `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` CMake variable.\n\n\n#### Building and Installing - Using vcpkg\n\nYou can download and install poco using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git\n$ cd vcpkg\n$ ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\n$ ./vcpkg integrate install\n$ ./vcpkg install poco\n```\nThe poco port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors.\nIf the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)\non the vcpkg repository.\n\n\n#### Building and Installing - Using Conan\n\nYou can download and install poco using the Conan(https://github.com/conan-io/conan)\npackage manager. It needed to be installed first(https://conan.io/downloads.html):\n\nYou can install Poco libraries from Conan Center(https://conan.io/center.html):\n\n    $ conan install -r conancenter poco/1.12.0@\n\nOr, you can download Poco recipe and build locally:\n\n    $ conan install -r conancenter poco/1.12.0@ --build=poco\n\nThe Poco recipe and packages in Conan Center are kept up to date by Conan team members and community contributors.\nIf the version is out of date, or you detect any wrong behavior, please create an issue or pull request(https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index)\non the Conan Center Index repository.\n\n\n### Building Without CMake\n\nIf you do not want to or cannot use CMake, POCO can also be built with Visual Studio\n(project and solution files included) or GNU Make (Linux, macOS and other supported Unix platforms).\n\nPlease refer to the [documentation](https://pocoproject.org/docs) for more information.\n\n\n### Getting POCO via a Package Manager\n\nPOCO can also be obtained via different [package managers](https://pocoproject.org/download.html).\n\n\n## Community and Contributing\n\nPOCO has an active user and contributing community, please visit our [website](https://pocoproject.org) and [blog](https://pocoproject.org/blog).\nAnswers to POCO-related questions can also be found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/poco-libraries).\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for submitting contributions, bugs reports, feature requests or security issues.\n\n### POCO vs. Boost\n\nIn regards to Boost, in spite of some functional overlapping,\nPOCO is best thought of as a Boost complement (rather than replacement).\nSide-by-side use of Boost and POCO is a very common occurrence.\n\n[overview]: doc/images/overview.png \"Poco Overview\"\n[logo]: doc/images/logo.png \"Poco Logo\"\n",
