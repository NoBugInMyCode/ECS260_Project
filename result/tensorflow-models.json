We aim to demonstrate the best practices for modeling so that\nTensorFlow users can take full advantage of TensorFlow for their research and\nproduct development.\n\nTo improve the transparency and reproducibility of our models, training logs on\n[TensorBoard.dev](https://tensorboard.dev) are also provided for models to the\nextent possible though not all models are suitable.\n\n| Directory | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| [official](official) | \u2022 A collection of example implementations for SOTA models using the latest TensorFlow 2's high-level APIs<br />\u2022 Officially maintained, supported, and kept up to date with the latest TensorFlow 2 APIs by TensorFlow<br />\u2022 Reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read<br /> For more details on the capabilities, check the guide on the [Model-garden](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfmodels)|\n| [research](research) | \u2022 A collection of research model implementations in TensorFlow 1 or 2 by researchers<br />\u2022 Maintained and supported by researchers |\n| [community](community) | \u2022 A curated list of the GitHub repositories with machine learning models and implementations powered by TensorFlow 2 |\n| [orbit](orbit) | \u2022 A flexible and lightweight library that users can easily use or fork when writing customized training loop code in TensorFlow 2.x. It seamlessly integrates with `tf.distribute` and supports running on different device types (CPU, GPU, and TPU). |\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the current release of tensorflow-models, please follow any one of the methods described below.\n\n#### Method 1: Install the TensorFlow Model Garden pip package\n\n<details>\n\n**tf-models-official** is the stable Model Garden package. Please check out the [releases](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/releases) to see what are available modules.\n\npip3 will install all models and dependencies automatically.\n\n```shell\npip3 install tf-models-official\n```\n\nPlease check out our examples:\n  - [basic library import](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tensorflow_models/tensorflow_models_pypi.ipynb)\n  - [nlp model building](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/docs/nlp/index.ipynb)\nto learn how to use a PIP package.\n\nNote that **tf-models-official** may not include the latest changes in the master branch of this\ngithub repo. To include latest changes, you may install **tf-models-nightly**,\nwhich is the nightly Model Garden package created daily automatically.\n\n```shell\npip3 install tf-models-nightly\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n#### Method 2: Clone the source\n\n<details>\n\n1. Clone the GitHub repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git\n```\n\n2. Add the top-level ***/models*** folder to the Python path.\n\n```shell\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/models\n```\n\nIf you are using in a Windows environment, you may need to use the following command with PowerShell:\n```shell\n$env:PYTHONPATH += \":\\path\\to\\models\"\n```\n\nIf you are using a Colab notebook, please set the Python path with os.environ.\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['PYTHONPATH'] += \":/path/to/models\"\n```\n\n3. Install other dependencies\n\n```shell\npip3 install --user -r models/official/requirements.txt\n```\n\nFinally, if you are using nlp packages, please also install\n**tensorflow-text-nightly**:\n\n```shell\npip3 install tensorflow-text-nightly\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n## Announcements\n\nPlease check [this page](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/wiki/Announcements) for recent announcements.\n\n## Contributions\n\n[![help wanted:paper implementation](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tensorflow/models/help%20wanted%3Apaper%20implementation)](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/labels/help%20wanted%3Apaper%20implementation)\n\nIf you want to contribute, please review the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/wiki/How-to-contribute).\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License 2.0](LICENSE)\n\n## Citing TensorFlow Model Garden\n\nIf you use TensorFlow Model Garden in your research, please cite this repository.\n\n```\n@misc{tensorflowmodelgarden2020,\n  author = {Hongkun Yu and Chen Chen and Xianzhi Du and Yeqing Li and Abdullah Rashwan and Le Hou and Pengchong Jin and Fan Yang\n            and Frederick Liu and Jaeyoun Kim and Jing Li},\n  title = {{TensorFlow Model Garden}},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/tensorflow/models}},\n  year = {2020}\n}\n```\n",
