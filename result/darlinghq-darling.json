        "readme": "# Darling\n\n![Darling logo](https://darlinghq.org/img/darling250.png)\n\nDarling is a runtime environment for macOS applications.\n\nPlease note that most GUI applications will not run at the moment.\n\n## Download\n\nPackages for some distributions are available for download\nunder [releases](https://github.com/darlinghq/darling/releases).\n\n## Build Instructions\n\nFor build instructions, visit [Darling Docs](https://docs.darlinghq.org/build-instructions.html).\n\n### Prefixes\n\nDarling has support for DPREFIXes, which are very similar to WINEPREFIXes. They are virtual \u201cchroot\u201d environments with an macOS-like filesystem structure, where you can install software safely. The default DPREFIX location is `~/.darling`, but this can be changed by exporting an identically named environment variable. A prefix is automatically created and initialized on first use.\n\nPlease note that we use `overlayfs` for creating prefixes, and so we cannot support putting prefix on a filesystem like NFS or eCryptfs. In particular, the default prefix location won't work if you have an encrypted home directory.\n\n### Hello world\n\nLet's start with a Hello world:\n\n````\n$ darling shell echo Hello world\nHello world\n````\n\nCongratulations, you have printed Hello world through Darling's OS X system call emulation and runtime libraries.\n\n### Installing software\n\nYou can install `.pkg` packages with the installer tool available inside shell. It is a somewhat limited cousin of OS X's installer:\n\n````\n$ darling shell\nDarling [~]$ installer -pkg mc-4.8.7-0.pkg -target /\n````\n\nThe Midnight Commander package from the above example is [available for download](https://darling-misc.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/mc-4.8.7-0.pkg).\n\nYou can uninstall and list packages with the `uninstaller` command.\n\n### Working with DMG images\n\nDMG images can be attached and detached from inside `darling shell` with `hdiutil`. This is how you can install Xcode along with its toolchain and SDKs (note that Xcode itself doesn't run yet):\n\n````\nDarling [~]$ hdiutil attach Xcode_7.2.dmg\n/Volumes/Xcode_7.2\nDarling [~]$ cp -r /Volumes/Xcode_7.2/Xcode.app /Applications\nDarling [~]$ export SDKROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk\nDarling [~]$ echo 'void main() { puts(\"Hello world\"); }' > helloworld.c\nDarling [~]$ /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang helloworld.c -o helloworld\nDarling [~]$ ./helloworld\nHello world\n````\n\nCongratulations, you have just compiled and run your own Hello world application with Apple's toolchain.\n\n### Working with XIP archives\n\nXcode is now distributed in `.xip` files. These can be installed using `unxip`:\n\n```\ncd /Applications\nunxip Xcode_11.3.xip\n```\n",
