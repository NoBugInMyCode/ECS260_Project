        "readme": "# react.dev\n\nThis repo contains the source code and documentation powering [react.dev](https://react.dev/).\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Git\n1. Node: any version starting with v16.8.0 or greater\n1. Yarn: See [Yarn website for installation instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)\n1. A fork of the repo (for any contributions)\n1. A clone of the [react.dev repo](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev) on your local machine\n\n### Installation\n\n1. `cd react.dev` to go into the project root\n3. `yarn` to install the website's npm dependencies\n\n### Running locally\n\n1. `yarn dev` to start the development server (powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/))\n1. `open http://localhost:3000` to open the site in your favorite browser\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Guidelines\n\nThe documentation is divided into several sections with a different tone and purpose. If you plan to write more than a few sentences, you might find it helpful to get familiar with the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines-for-text) for the appropriate sections.\n\n### Create a branch\n\n1. `git checkout main` from any folder in your local `react.dev` repository\n1. `git pull origin main` to ensure you have the latest main code\n1. `git checkout -b the-name-of-my-branch` (replacing `the-name-of-my-branch` with a suitable name) to create a branch\n\n### Make the change\n\n1. Follow the [\"Running locally\"](#running-locally) instructions\n1. Save the files and check in the browser\n  1. Changes to React components in `src` will hot-reload\n  1. Changes to markdown files in `content` will hot-reload\n  1. If working with plugins, you may need to remove the `.cache` directory and restart the server\n\n### Test the change\n\n1. If possible, test any visual changes in all latest versions of common browsers, on both desktop and mobile.\n2. Run `yarn check-all`. (This will run Prettier, ESLint and validate types.)\n\n### Push it\n\n1. `git add -A && git commit -m \"My message\"` (replacing `My message` with a commit message, such as `Fix header logo on Android`) to stage and commit your changes\n1. `git push my-fork-name the-name-of-my-branch`\n1. Go to the [react.dev repo](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev) and you should see recently pushed branches.\n1. Follow GitHub's instructions.\n1. If possible, include screenshots of visual changes. A preview build is triggered after your changes are pushed to GitHub.\n\n## Translation\n\nIf you are interested in translating `react.dev`, please see the current translation efforts [here](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/issues/4135).\n\n## License\nContent submitted to [react.dev](https://react.dev/) is CC-BY-4.0 licensed, as found in the [LICENSE-DOCS.md](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/LICENSE-DOCS.md) file.\n",
