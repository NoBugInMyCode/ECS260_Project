It is designed to close the gap between the\nproductivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends.\nTVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end to end compilation to different backends.\n\nLicense\n-------\nTVM is licensed under the [Apache-2.0](LICENSE) license.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\nCheck out the [TVM Documentation](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/) site for installation instructions, tutorials, examples, and more.\nThe [Getting Started with TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorial/introduction.html) tutorial is a great\nplace to start.\n\nContribute to TVM\n-----------------\nTVM adopts apache committer model, we aim to create an open source project that is maintained and owned by the community.\nCheck out the [Contributor Guide](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/contribute/).\n\nAcknowledgement\n---------------\nWe learned a lot from the following projects when building TVM.\n- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): Part of TVM's TIR and arithmetic simplification module\n  originates from Halide. We also learned and adapted some part of lowering pipeline from Halide.\n- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.\n- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence.\n",
