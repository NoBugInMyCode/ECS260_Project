Additionally, we have a core project team composed of:\n\n#### [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani) - Founder/Lead\n\n<img align=\"left\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110953?v=4&s=40\">\n  Addy is a Software Engineer at Google who originally created TodoMVC.

Whilst we hope that this project can offer assistance in deciding what frameworks are worth spending more time looking at, remember that the Todo application offers a limited view of a framework's potential capability.\n\nIt is meant to be used as a gateway to reviewing how a basic application using a framework may be structured, and we heavily recommend investing time researching a solution in more depth before opting to use it.\n\nAlso, please keep in mind that TodoMVC is not the perfect way to compare the size of different frameworks. We intentionally use the unminified versions to make reading the source code easier.\n\n\n## Getting Involved\n\nWhilst we enjoy implementing and improving existing Todo apps, we're always interested in speaking to framework authors (and users) wishing to share Todo app implementations in their framework/solution of choice.\n\nCheck out our [contribution docs](contributing.md) for more info.\n\n\n## License\n\nEverything in this repo is MIT License unless otherwise specified.\n\n[MIT](license.md) \u00a9 Addy Osmani, Sindre Sorhus, Pascal Hartig, Stephen Sawchuk.\n",
