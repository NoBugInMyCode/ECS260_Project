We recommend using more sophisticated alternatives like [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/), [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/), [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), or [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/facebookarchive/flux/blob/main/website/static/img/flux-logo-color.svg\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"20%\" />\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n  Flux\n</h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  An application architecture for React utilizing a unidirectional data flow.<br>\n\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/flux/blob/master/LICENSE\">\n    <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%20-blue.svg\" alt=\"Licence Badge\" />\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/flux\">\n    <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/flux.svg?style=flat\" alt=\"Current npm package version.\" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<img src=\"./img/flux-diagram-white-background.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\n\n## Getting Started\n\nStart by looking through the [guides and examples](./examples) on Github. For more resources and API docs check out [facebook.github.io/flux](https://facebookarchive.github.io/flux).\n\n## How Flux works\n\nFor more information on how Flux works check out the [Flux Concepts](./examples/flux-concepts) guide, or the [In Depth Overview](https://facebookarchive.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview).\n\n## Requirements\n\nFlux is more of a pattern than a framework, and does not have any hard dependencies. However, we often use [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) as a basis for `Stores` and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for our `Views`. The one piece of Flux not readily available elsewhere is the `Dispatcher`. This module, along with some other utilities, is available here to complete your Flux toolbox.\n\n## Installing Flux\n\nFlux is available as a [npm module](https://www.npmjs.org/package/flux), so you can add it to your package.json file or run `npm install flux`. The dispatcher will be available as `Flux.Dispatcher` and can be required like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst Dispatcher = require('flux').Dispatcher;\n```\n\nTake a look at the [dispatcher API and some examples](https://facebookarchive.github.io/flux/docs/dispatcher).\n\n## Flux Utils\n\nWe have also provided some basic utility classes to help get you started with Flux. These base classes are a solid foundation for a simple Flux application, but they are **not** a feature-complete framework that will handle all use cases. There are many other great Flux frameworks out there if these utilities do not fulfill your needs.\n\n```js\nimport {ReduceStore} from 'flux/utils';\n\nclass CounterStore extends ReduceStore<number> {\n  getInitialState(): number {\n    return 0;\n  }\n\n  reduce(state: number, action: Object): number {\n    switch (action.type) {\n      case 'increment':\n        return state + 1;\n\n      case 'square':\n        return state * state;\n\n      default:\n        return state;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCheck out the [examples](./examples) and [documentation](https://facebookarchive.github.io/flux/docs/flux-utils) for more information.\n\n## Building Flux from a Cloned Repo\n\nClone the repo and navigate into the resulting `flux` directory. Then run `npm install`.\n\nThis will run [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)-based build tasks automatically and produce the file Flux.js, which you can then require as a module.\n\nYou could then require the Dispatcher like so:\n\n```javascript\nconst Dispatcher = require('path/to/this/directory/Flux').Dispatcher;\n```\n\nThe build process also produces de-sugared versions of the `Dispatcher` and `invariant` modules in a `lib` directory, and you can require those modules directly, copying them into whatever directory is most convenient for you. The `flux-todomvc` and `flux-chat` example applications both do this.\n\n## License\n\nFlux is BSD-licensed. We also provide an additional patent grant.\n",
