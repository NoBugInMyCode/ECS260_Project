Also uses ViewModels and LiveData.\n\n* **[PersistenceContentProviderSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/master/PersistenceContentProviderSample)** - Shows how to expose data via a Content Provider using Room.\n\n* **[GithubBrowserSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/master/GithubBrowserSample)** - An **advanced**  sample that uses the Architecture components, Dagger and the Github API, in Kotlin.\n\n* **[BasicRxJavaSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/master/BasicRxJavaSample)** - Shows how to use Room with RxJava 2. Also uses ViewModels.\n\n* **[PersistenceMigrationsSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/master/PersistenceMigrationsSample)** - Shows how to implement migrations in Room.\n\n* **[BasicRxJavaKotlinSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/master/BasicRxJavaSampleKotlin)** - Shows\nhow to use ViewModels and Room together with RxJava, in Kotlin.\n\n * **[PagingSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/PagingSample)** - Shows\n  how to use the Paging library with Room, in Kotlin.\n\n * **[PagingNetworkSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/PagingWithNetworkSample)** - Shows\n  how to use the Paging library with a backend API via Retrofit, in Kotlin.\n\n* **[NavigationBasicSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/NavigationBasicSample)** - Shows\n  how to use Navigation to perform navigation and deep linking in Kotlin.\n\n* **[NavigationAdvancedSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/NavigationAdvancedSample)** - Shows\n  how to handle multiple back stacks with Navigation and a BottomNavigationView.\n\n* **[LiveDataSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/LiveDataSample)** - Shows\n  how to integrate Kotlin coroutines with Architecture Components such as `LiveData`.\n\n* **[ViewBindingSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/ViewBindingSample)** - Shows how to use view bindings in an activity and in fragments.\n\n* **[WorkManagerSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/WorkManagerSample)** - Shows\n  how to use WorkManager to do background work, in Kotlin.\n\n* **[WorkManagerMultiprocessSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/WorkManagerMultiprocessSample)** - Shows how to use WorkManager in apps that manage multiple processes.\n\n\n### Reporting Issues\n\nYou can report an [Issue](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/issues) on the samples using this repository.
