Whiteboards are not bad \u2013 CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode _probably_ fall into a similar category.\n\nThe companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) [our recommendations](RECOMMENDATIONS.md) for ways to conduct better interviews.\n\n### tl;dr\n\n- Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is \ud83d\udc4d\n- Solving CS trivia, technical puzzles, riddles, brainteasers (with or without whiteboard) is \ud83d\udc4e\n\nPlease open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to be added.\n\n### Duds\n\nIf you've been through an interview with one of these companies recently, and your experience suggests otherwise from their description, please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to remove them from this list.\n\n### I want to search/sort/filter/group by X!\n\nCheck out our [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shr3eGPDm3wGjT2gA)!\n\nAdditions to this document that are properly formatted will automatically be pushed and added to Airtable.
