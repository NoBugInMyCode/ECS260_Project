It has been integrating tremendous efforts from many people. However, we have seen many high-quality repos emerged in the last years, such as:\n\n* [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark)\n* [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)\n* [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)\n\n**At this point, I think this repo is out-of-data in terms of the pipeline and coding style, and will not maintain actively. Though you can still use this repo as a playground, I highly recommend you move to the above repos to delve into west world of object detection!**\n\n## Introduction\n\n### :boom: Good news! This repo supports pytorch-1.0 now!!! We borrowed some code and techniques from [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark). Just go to pytorch-1.0 branch!\n\nThis project is a *faster* pytorch implementation of faster R-CNN, aimed to accelerating the training of faster R-CNN object detection models. Recently, there are a number of good implementations:\n\n* [rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn), developed based on Pycaffe + Numpy\n\n* [longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch](https://github.com/longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch), developed based on Pytorch + Numpy\n\n* [endernewton/tf-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/endernewton/tf-faster-rcnn), developed based on TensorFlow + Numpy\n\n* [ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn), developed based on Pytorch + TensorFlow + Numpy\n\nDuring our implementing, we referred the above implementations, especailly [longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch](https://github.com/longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch). However, our implementation has several unique and new features compared with the above implementations:\n\n* **It is pure Pytorch code**. We convert all the numpy implementations to pytorch!\n\n* **It supports multi-image batch training**. We revise all the layers, including dataloader, rpn, roi-pooling, etc., to support multiple images in each minibatch.\n\n* **It supports multiple GPUs training**. We use a multiple GPU wrapper (nn.DataParallel here) to make it flexible to use one or more GPUs, as a merit of the above two features.\n\n* **It supports three pooling methods**. We integrate three pooling methods: roi pooing, roi align and roi crop. More importantly, we modify all of them to support multi-image batch training.\n\n* **It is memory efficient**. We limit the image aspect ratio, and group images with similar aspect ratios into a minibatch. As such, we can train resnet101 and VGG16 with batchsize = 4 (4 images) on a single Titan X (12 GB). When training with 8 GPU, the maximum batchsize for each GPU is 3 (Res101), totaling 24.\n\n* **It is faster**. Based on the above modifications, the training is much faster. We report the training speed on NVIDIA TITAN Xp in the tables below.\n\n### What we are doing and going to do\n\n- [x] Support both python2 and python3 (great thanks to [cclauss](https://github.com/cclauss)).\n- [x] Add deformable pooling layer (mainly supported by [Xander](https://github.com/xanderchf)).\n- [x] Support pytorch-0.4.0 (this branch).\n- [x] Support tensorboardX.\n- [x] Support pytorch-1.0 (go to pytorch-1.0 branch).\n\n## Other Implementations\n\n* [Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)](https://github.com/jwyang/fpn.pytorch)\n\n* [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/roytseng-tw/mask-rcnn.pytorch) (~~ongoing~~ already implemented by [roytseng-tw](https://github.com/roytseng-tw))\n\n* [Graph R-CNN](https://github.com/jwyang/graph-rcnn.pytorch) (extension to scene graph generation)\n\n## Tutorial\n\n* [Blog](http://www.telesens.co/2018/03/11/object-detection-and-classification-using-r-cnns/) by [ankur6ue](https://github.com/ankur6ue)\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nWe benchmark our code thoroughly on three datasets: pascal voc, coco and visual genome, using two different network architectures: vgg16 and resnet101.

Actually, you can refer to any others. After downloading the data, create softlinks in the folder data/.\n\n* **COCO**: Please also follow the instructions in [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn#beyond-the-demo-installation-for-training-and-testing-models) to prepare the data.\n\n* **Visual Genome**: Please follow the instructions in [bottom-up-attention](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) to prepare Visual Genome dataset. You need to download the images and object annotation files first, and then perform proprecessing to obtain the vocabulary and cleansed annotations based on the scripts provided in this repository.\n\n### Pretrained Model\n\nWe used two pretrained models in our experiments, VGG and ResNet101. You can download these two models from:\n\n* VGG16: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s3brpk0bdq60nyb/vgg16_caffe.pth?dl=0), [VT Server](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jw2yang/faster-rcnn/pretrained-base-models/vgg16_caffe.pth)\n\n* ResNet101: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iev3tkbz5wyyuz9/resnet101_caffe.pth?dl=0), [VT Server](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jw2yang/faster-rcnn/pretrained-base-models/resnet101_caffe.pth)\n\nDownload them and put them into the data/pretrained_model/.\n\n**NOTE**. We compare the pretrained models from Pytorch and Caffe, and surprisingly find Caffe pretrained models have slightly better performance than Pytorch pretrained. We would suggest to use Caffe pretrained models from the above link to reproduce our results.\n\n**If you want to use pytorch pre-trained models, please remember to transpose images from BGR to RGB, and also use the same data transformer (minus mean and normalize) as used in pretrained model.**\n\n### Compilation\n\nAs pointed out by [ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn), choose the right `-arch` in `make.sh` file, to compile the cuda code:\n\n  | GPU model  | Architecture |\n  | ------------- | ------------- |\n  | TitanX (Maxwell/Pascal) | sm_52 |\n  | GTX 960M | sm_50 |\n  | GTX 1080 (Ti) | sm_61 |\n  | Grid K520 (AWS g2.2xlarge) | sm_30 |\n  | Tesla K80 (AWS p2.xlarge) | sm_37 |\n\nMore details about setting the architecture can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) or [here](http://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/)\n\nInstall all the python dependencies using pip:\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nCompile the cuda dependencies using following simple commands:\n\n```\ncd lib\nsh make.sh\n```\n\nIt will compile all the modules you need, including NMS, ROI_Pooing, ROI_Align and ROI_Crop. The default version is compiled with Python 2.7, please compile by yourself if you are using a different python version.\n\n**As pointed out in this [issue](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch/issues/16), if you encounter some error during the compilation, you might miss to export the CUDA paths to your environment.**\n\n## Train\n\nBefore training, set the right directory to save and load the trained models. Change the arguments \"save_dir\" and \"load_dir\" in trainval_net.py and test_net.py to adapt to your environment.\n\nTo train a faster R-CNN model with vgg16 on pascal_voc, simply run:\n```\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU_ID python trainval_net.py \\\n                   --dataset pascal_voc --net vgg16 \\\n                   --bs $BATCH_SIZE --nw $WORKER_NUMBER \\\n                   --lr $LEARNING_RATE --lr_decay_step $DECAY_STEP \\\n                   --cuda\n```\nwhere 'bs' is the batch size with default 1. Alternatively, to train with resnet101 on pascal_voc, simple run:\n```\n CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU_ID python trainval_net.py \\\n                    --dataset pascal_voc --net res101 \\\n                    --bs $BATCH_SIZE --nw $WORKER_NUMBER \\\n                    --lr $LEARNING_RATE --lr_decay_step $DECAY_STEP \\\n                    --cuda\n```\nAbove, BATCH_SIZE and WORKER_NUMBER can be set adaptively according to your GPU memory size. **On Titan Xp with 12G memory, it can be up to 4**.\n\nIf you have multiple (say 8) Titan Xp GPUs, then just use them all! Try:\n```\npython trainval_net.py --dataset pascal_voc --net vgg16 \\\n                       --bs 24 --nw 8 \\\n                       --lr $LEARNING_RATE --lr_decay_step $DECAY_STEP \\\n                       --cuda --mGPUs\n\n```\n\nChange dataset to \"coco\" or 'vg' if you want to train on COCO or Visual Genome.\n\n## Test\n\nIf you want to evaluate the detection performance of a pre-trained vgg16 model on pascal_voc test set, simply run\n```\npython test_net.py --dataset pascal_voc --net vgg16 \\\n                   --checksession $SESSION --checkepoch $EPOCH --checkpoint $CHECKPOINT \\\n                   --cuda\n```\nSpecify the specific model session, checkepoch and checkpoint, e.g., SESSION=1, EPOCH=6, CHECKPOINT=416.\n\n## Demo\n\nIf you want to run detection on your own images with a pre-trained model, download the pretrained model listed in above tables or train your own models at first, then add images to folder $ROOT/images, and then run\n```\npython demo.py --net vgg16 \\\n               --checksession $SESSION --checkepoch $EPOCH --checkpoint $CHECKPOINT \\\n               --cuda --load_dir path/to/model/directoy\n```\n\nThen you will find the detection results in folder $ROOT/images.\n\n**Note the default demo.py merely support pascal_voc categories. You need to change the [line](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch/blob/530f3fdccaa60d05fa068bc2148695211586bd88/demo.py#L156) to adapt your own model.**\n\nBelow are some detection results:\n\n<div style=\"color:#0000FF\" align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/img3_det_res101.jpg\" width=\"430\"/> <img src=\"images/img4_det_res101.jpg\" width=\"430\"/>\n</div>\n\n## Webcam Demo\n\nYou can use a webcam in a real-time demo by running\n```\npython demo.py --net vgg16 \\\n               --checksession $SESSION --checkepoch $EPOCH --checkpoint $CHECKPOINT \\\n               --cuda --load_dir path/to/model/directoy \\\n               --webcam $WEBCAM_ID\n```\nThe demo is stopped by clicking the image window and then pressing the 'q' key.\n\n## Authorship\n\nThis project is equally contributed by [Jianwei Yang](https://github.com/jwyang) and [Jiasen Lu](https://github.com/jiasenlu), and many others (thanks to them!).\n\n## Citation\n\n    @article{jjfaster2rcnn,\n        Author = {Jianwei Yang and Jiasen Lu and Dhruv Batra and Devi Parikh},\n        Title = {A Faster Pytorch Implementation of Faster R-CNN},\n        Journal = {https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch},\n        Year = {2017}\n    }\n\n    @inproceedings{renNIPS15fasterrcnn,\n        Author = {Shaoqing Ren and Kaiming He and Ross Girshick and Jian Sun},\n        Title = {Faster {R-CNN}: Towards Real-Time Object Detection\n                 with Region Proposal Networks},\n        Booktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems ({NIPS})},\n        Year = {2015}\n    }\n",
