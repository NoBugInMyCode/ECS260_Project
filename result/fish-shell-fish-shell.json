A few\nimportant differences can be found at\nhttps://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html by searching for the\nmagic phrase \u201cunlike other shells\u201d.\n\nDetailed user documentation is available by running ``help`` within\nfish, and also at https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html\n\nGetting fish\n------------\n\nmacOS\n~~~~~\n\nfish can be installed:\n\n-  using `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__: ``brew install fish``\n-  using `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org/>`__:\n   ``sudo port install fish``\n-  using the `installer from fishshell.com <https://fishshell.com/>`__\n-  as a `standalone app from fishshell.com <https://fishshell.com/>`__\n\nNote: The minimum supported macOS version is 10.10 \"Yosemite\".\n\nPackages for Linux\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPackages for Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux/CentOS are available from the `openSUSE Build\nService <https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=shells%3Afish&package=fish>`__.\n\nPackages for Ubuntu are available from the `fish\nPPA <https://launchpad.net/~fish-shell/+archive/ubuntu/release-3>`__,\nand can be installed using the following commands:\n\n::\n\n   sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt install fish\n\nInstructions for other distributions may be found at\n`fishshell.com <https://fishshell.com>`__.\n\nWindows\n~~~~~~~\n\n-  On Windows 10/11, fish can be installed under the WSL Windows Subsystem\n   for Linux with the instructions for the appropriate distribution\n   listed above under \u201cPackages for Linux\u201d, or from source with the\n   instructions below.\n-  fish (4.0 on and onwards) cannot be installed in Cygwin, due to a lack of Rust support.\n\nBuilding from source\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf packages are not available for your platform, GPG-signed tarballs are\navailable from `fishshell.com <https://fishshell.com/>`__ and\n`fish-shell on\nGitHub <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases>`__. See the\n`Building <#building>`__ section for instructions.\n\nRunning fish\n------------\n\nOnce installed, run ``fish`` from your current shell to try fish out!\n\nDependencies\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRunning fish requires:\n\n-  A terminfo database, typically from curses or ncurses (preinstalled on most \\*nix systems) - this needs to be the directory tree format, not the \"hashed\" database.\n   If this is unavailable, fish uses an included xterm-256color definition.\n-  some common \\*nix system utilities (currently ``mktemp``), in\n   addition to the basic POSIX utilities (``cat``, ``cut``, ``dirname``,\n   ``file``, ``ls``, ``mkdir``, ``mkfifo``, ``rm``, ``sort``, ``tee``, ``tr``,\n   ``uname`` and ``sed`` at least, but the full coreutils plus ``find`` and\n   ``awk`` is preferred)\n-  The gettext library, if compiled with\n   translation support\n\nThe following optional features also have specific requirements:\n\n-  builtin commands that have the ``--help`` option or print usage\n   messages require ``nroff`` or ``mandoc`` for\n   display\n-  automated completion generation from manual pages requires Python 3.5+\n-  the ``fish_config`` web configuration tool requires Python 3.5+ and a web browser\n-  system clipboard integration (with the default Ctrl-V and Ctrl-X\n   bindings) require either the ``xsel``, ``xclip``,\n   ``wl-copy``/``wl-paste`` or ``pbcopy``/``pbpaste`` utilities\n-  full completions for ``yarn`` and ``npm`` require the\n   ``all-the-package-names`` NPM module\n-  ``colorls`` is used, if installed, to add color when running ``ls`` on platforms\n   that do not have color support (such as OpenBSD)\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\n.. _dependencies-1:\n\nDependencies\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCompiling fish requires:\n\n-  Rust (version 1.70 or later)\n-  CMake (version 3.15 or later)\n-  a C compiler (for system feature detection and the test helper binary)\n-  PCRE2 (headers and libraries) - optional, this will be downloaded if missing\n-  gettext (headers and libraries) - optional, for translation support\n-  an Internet connection, as other dependencies will be downloaded automatically\n\nSphinx is also optionally required to build the documentation from a\ncloned git repository.\n\nAdditionally, running the full test suite requires Python 3, tmux, and the pexpect package.\n\nBuilding from source with CMake\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRather than building from source, consider using a packaged build for your platform. Using the\nsteps below makes fish difficult to uninstall or upgrade. Release packages are available from the\nlinks above, and up-to-date `development builds of fish are available for many platforms\n<https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/wiki/Development-builds>`__\n\nTo install into ``/usr/local``, run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   mkdir build; cd build\n   cmake ..\n   cmake --build .\n   sudo cmake --install .\n\nThe install directory can be changed using the\n``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` parameter for ``cmake``.\n\nCMake Build options\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn addition to the normal CMake build options (like ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``), fish's CMake build has some other options available to customize it.\n\n- BUILD_DOCS=ON|OFF - whether to build the documentation. This is automatically set to OFF when Sphinx isn't installed.\n- INSTALL_DOCS=ON|OFF - whether to install the docs. This is automatically set to on when BUILD_DOCS is or prebuilt documentation is available (like when building in-tree from a tarball).\n- FISH_USE_SYSTEM_PCRE2=ON|OFF - whether to use an installed pcre2. This is normally autodetected.\n- MAC_CODESIGN_ID=String|OFF - the codesign ID to use on Mac, or \"OFF\" to disable codesigning.\n- WITH_GETTEXT=ON|OFF - whether to build with gettext support for translations.\n- extra_functionsdir, extra_completionsdir and extra_confdir - to compile in an additional directory to be searched for functions, completions and configuration snippets\n\nBuilding fish as self-installable (experimental)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can also build fish as a self-installing binary.\n\nThis will include all the datafiles like the included functions or web configuration tool in the main ``fish`` binary.\n\nOn the first interactive run, and whenever it notices they are out of date, it will extract the datafiles to ~/.local/share/fish/install/ (currently, subject to change). You can do this manually by running ``fish --install``.\n\nTo install fish as self-installable, just use ``cargo``, like::\n\n   cargo install --path /path/to/fish # if you have a git clone\n   cargo install --git https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell --tag 4.0 # to build from git once 4.0 is released\n   cargo install --git https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell # to build the current development snapshot without cloning\n\nThis will place the binaries in ``~/.cargo/bin/``, but you can place them wherever you want.\n\nThis build won't have the HTML docs (``help`` will open the online version) or translations.\n\nIt will try to build the man pages with sphinx-build. If that is not available and you would like to include man pages, you need to install it and retrigger the build script, e.g. by setting FISH_BUILD_DOCS=1::\n\n  FISH_BUILD_DOCS=1 cargo install --path .\n\nSetting it to \"0\" disables the inclusion of man pages.\n\nYou can also link this build statically (but not against glibc) and move it to other computers.\n\nContributing Changes to the Code\n--------------------------------\n\nSee the `Guide for Developers <CONTRIBUTING.rst>`__.\n\nContact Us\n----------\n\nQuestions, comments, rants and raves can be posted to the official fish\nmailing list at https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fish-users\nor join us on our `matrix\nchannel <https://matrix.to/#/#fish-shell:matrix.org>`__. Or use the `fish tag\non Unix & Linux Stackexchange <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fish>`__.\nThere is also a fish tag on Stackoverflow, but it is typically a poor fit.\n\nFound a bug? Have an awesome idea? Please `open an\nissue <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/new>`__.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/workflows/make%20test/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/actions\n",
