For example, the plugins will be checked passively but their version with a mixed detection mode (passively + aggressively). Potential config backup files will also be checked, along with other interesting findings.\n\nIf a more stealthy approach is required, then ```wpscan --stealthy --url blog.tld``` can be used.\nAs a result, when using the ```--enumerate``` option, don't forget to set the ```--plugins-detection``` accordingly, as its default is 'passive'.\n\nFor more options, open a terminal and type ```wpscan --help``` (if you built wpscan from the source, you should type the command outside of the git repo)\n\nThe DB is located at ~/.wpscan/db\n\n## Optional: WordPress Vulnerability Database API\n\nThe WPScan CLI tool uses the [WordPress Vulnerability Database API](https://wpscan.com/api) to retrieve WordPress vulnerability data in real time. For WPScan to retrieve the vulnerability data an API token must be supplied via the `--api-token` option, or via a configuration file, as discussed below. An API token can be obtained by registering an account on [WPScan.com](https://wpscan.com/register).\n\nUp to **25** API requests per day are given free of charge, that should be suitable to scan most WordPress websites at least once per day. When the daily 25 API requests are exhausted, WPScan will continue to work as normal but without any vulnerability data.\n\n### How many API requests do you need?\n\n- Our WordPress scanner makes one API request for the WordPress version, one request per installed plugin and one request per installed theme.\n- On average, a WordPress website has 22 installed plugins.\n\n## Load CLI options from file/s\n\nWPScan can load all options (including the --url) from configuration files, the following locations are checked (order: first to last):\n\n- ~/.wpscan/scan.json\n- ~/.wpscan/scan.yml\n- pwd/.wpscan/scan.json\n- pwd/.wpscan/scan.yml\n\nIf those files exist, options from the `cli_options` key will be loaded and overridden if found twice.\n\ne.g:\n\n~/.wpscan/scan.yml:\n\n```yml\ncli_options:\n  proxy: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'\n  verbose: true\n```\n\npwd/.wpscan/scan.yml:\n\n```yml\ncli_options:\n  proxy: 'socks5://127.0.0.1:9090'\n  url: 'http://target.tld'\n```\n\nRunning ```wpscan``` in the current directory (pwd), is the same as ```wpscan -v --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9090 --url http://target.tld```\n\n## Save API Token in a file\n\nThe feature mentioned above is useful to keep the API Token in a config file and not have to supply it via the CLI each time. To do so, create the ~/.wpscan/scan.yml file containing the below:\n\n```yml\ncli_options:\n  api_token: 'YOUR_API_TOKEN'\n```\n\n## Load API Token From ENV (since v3.7.10)\n\nThe API Token will be automatically loaded from the ENV variable `WPSCAN_API_TOKEN` if present. If the `--api-token` CLI option is also provided, the value from the CLI will be used.\n\n\n## Enumerating usernames\n\n```shell\nwpscan --url https://target.tld/ --enumerate u\n```\n\nEnumerating a range of usernames\n\n```shell\nwpscan --url https://target.tld/ --enumerate u1-100\n```\n\n** replace u1-100 with a range of your choice.\n\n# LICENSE\n\n## WPScan Public Source License\n\nThe WPScan software (henceforth referred to simply as \"WPScan\") is dual-licensed - Copyright 2011-2019 WPScan Team.\n\nCases that include commercialization of WPScan require a commercial, non-free license.
