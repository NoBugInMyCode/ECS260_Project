Widescreen can also be disabled if preferred.)*</sub>\n\n# What is DevilutionX\n\nDevilutionX is a port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game while providing engine improvements, bug fixes, and some optional quality of life features.\n\nCheck out the [manual](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki) for available features and how to take advantage of them.\n\nFor a full list of changes, see our [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n# How to Install\n\nNote: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD, you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo) or Battle.net. Alternatively, you can use `spawn.mpq` from the [shareware](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/latest/download/spawn.mpq) [[2]](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/demos/diablosw.exe) version, in place of `DIABDAT.MPQ`, to play the shareware portion of the game.\n\nDownload the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases/latest) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing or [build from source](#building-from-source).\n\n- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or Diablo installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)) to the DevilutionX folder.\n- To run the Diablo: Hellfire expansion, you will also need to copy `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, and `hfvoice.mpq`.\n\nFor more detailed instructions: [Installation Instructions](./docs/installing.md).\n\n# Contributing\n\nWe are always looking for more people to help with [coding](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md), [documentation](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki), [testing the latest builds](#test-builds), spreading the word, or simply just hanging out on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/devilutionx).\n\n# Mods\n\nWe hope to provide a good starting point for mods. In addition to the full Devilution source code, we also provide modding tools. Check out the list of known [mods based on DevilutionX](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Mods).\n\n# Test Builds\n\nIf you want to help test the latest development version (make sure to back up your files, as these may contain bugs), you can fetch the test build artifact from one of the build servers:\n\n*Note: You must be logged into GitHub to download the attachments!*\n\n[![Linux x86_64](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Linux_x86_64.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Linux_x86_64.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![Linux AArch64](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Linux_aarch64.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Linux_aarch64.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![Linux x86](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Linux_x86.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Linux_x86.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![Linux x86_64 SDL1](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Linux_x86_64_SDL1.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Linux_x86_64_SDL1.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![macOS x86_64](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/macOS_x86_64.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/macOS_x86_64.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![Windows MSVC x64](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Windows_MSVC_x64.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Windows_MSVC_x64.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![Windows MinGW x64](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Windows_MinGW_x64.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Windows_MinGW_x64.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![Windows MinGW x86](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Windows_MinGW_x86.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Windows_MinGW_x86.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![Android](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Android.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/Android.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![iOS](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/iOS.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/iOS.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![PS4](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/PS4.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/PS4.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![Original Xbox](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/xbox_nxdk.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/xbox_nxdk.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![Xbox One/Series](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/xbox_one.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/xbox_one.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n[![Nintendo Switch](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/switch.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/switch.yml)\n[![Sony PlayStation Vita](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/vita.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/vita.yml)\n[![Nintendo 3DS](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/3ds.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/3ds.yml)\n[![Amiga M68K](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/amiga-m68k.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/actions/workflows/amiga-m68k.yml)\n\n# Building from Source\n\nWant to compile the program by yourself?
