Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your\nblog to the most popular websites in the world. PHP is distributed under the\n[PHP License v3.01](LICENSE).\n\n[![Push](https://github.com/php/php-src/actions/workflows/push.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/php/php-src/actions/workflows/push.yml)\n[![Fuzzing Status](https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/badges/php.svg)](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?sort=-opened&can=1&q=proj:php)\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe PHP manual is available at [php.net/docs](https://www.php.net/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prebuilt packages and binaries\n\nPrebuilt packages and binaries can be used to get up and running fast with PHP.\n\nFor Windows, the PHP binaries can be obtained from\n[windows.php.net](https://windows.php.net). After extracting the archive the\n`*.exe` files are ready to use.\n\nFor other systems, see the [installation chapter](https://www.php.net/install).\n\n### Building PHP source code\n\n*For Windows, see [Build your own PHP on Windows](https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild_sdk_2).*\n\nFor a minimal PHP build from Git, you will need autoconf, bison, and re2c. For\na default build, you will additionally need libxml2 and libsqlite3.\n\nOn Ubuntu, you can install these using:\n\n    sudo apt install -y pkg-config build-essential autoconf bison re2c \\\n                        libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev\n\nOn Fedora, you can install these using:\n\n    sudo dnf install re2c bison autoconf make libtool ccache libxml2-devel sqlite-devel\n\nGenerate configure:\n\n    ./buildconf\n\nConfigure your build. `--enable-debug` is recommended for development, see\n`./configure --help` for a full list of options.\n\n    # For development\n    ./configure --enable-debug\n    # For production\n    ./configure\n\nBuild PHP. To speed up the build, specify the maximum number of jobs using `-j`:\n\n    make -j4\n\nThe number of jobs should usually match the number of available cores, which\ncan be determined using `nproc`.\n\n## Testing PHP source code\n\nPHP ships with an extensive test suite, the command `make test` is used after\nsuccessful compilation of the sources to run this test suite.\n\nIt is possible to run tests using multiple cores by setting `-jN` in\n`TEST_PHP_ARGS`:\n\n    make TEST_PHP_ARGS=-j4 test\n\nShall run `make test` with a maximum of 4 concurrent jobs: Generally the maximum\nnumber of jobs should not exceed the number of cores available.\n\nThe [qa.php.net](https://qa.php.net) site provides more detailed info about\ntesting and quality assurance.\n\n## Installing PHP built from source\n\nAfter a successful build (and test), PHP may be installed with:\n\n    make install\n\nDepending on your permissions and prefix, `make install` may need super user\npermissions.\n\n## PHP extensions\n\nExtensions provide additional functionality on top of PHP. PHP consists of many\nessential bundled extensions. Additional extensions can be found in the PHP\nExtension Community Library - [PECL](https://pecl.php.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe PHP source code is located in the Git repository at\n[github.com/php/php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src). Contributions are most\nwelcome by forking the repository and sending a pull request.\n\nDiscussions are done on GitHub, but depending on the topic can also be relayed\nto the official PHP developer mailing list internals@lists.php.net.\n\nNew features require an RFC and must be accepted by the developers. See\n[Request for comments - RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc) and\n[Voting on PHP features](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting) for more information\non the process.\n\nBug fixes don't require an RFC. If the bug has a GitHub issue, reference it in\nthe commit message using `GH-NNNNNN`. Use `#NNNNNN` for tickets in the old\n[bugs.php.net](https://bugs.php.net) bug tracker.\n\n    Fix GH-7815: php_uname doesn't recognise latest Windows versions\n    Fix #55371: get_magic_quotes_gpc() throws deprecation warning\n\nSee [Git workflow](https://wiki.php.net/vcs/gitworkflow) for details on how pull\nrequests are merged.\n\n### Guidelines for contributors\n\nSee further documents in the repository for more information on how to\ncontribute:\n\n- [Contributing to PHP](/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [PHP coding standards](/CODING_STANDARDS.md)\n- [Internal documentation](https://php.github.io/php-src/)\n- [Mailing list rules](/docs/mailinglist-rules.md)\n- [PHP release process](/docs/release-process.md)\n\n## Credits\n\nFor the list of people who've put work into PHP, please see the\n[PHP credits page](https://www.php.net/credits.php).\n",
