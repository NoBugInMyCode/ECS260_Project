(https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n**WARNING:** I do **NOT** take responsibility for what may happen to your system! Run scripts at your own risk!\nAlso, other variants of this repo are not technically \"new\" versions of this, but they are different in their own respective ways. There are some sites saying that other projects are \"new\" versions of this, but that is inaccurate. \n\n## How To Run the Windows10Debloater.ps1 and the Windows10DebloaterGUI.ps1 files\n\nThere are different methods of running the PowerShell script. The methods are as follows:\n\n### First Method\n\n1) Download the .zip file on the main page of the GitHub and extract the .zip file to your desired location\n2) Once extracted, open [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-5.1) (or [PowerShell ISE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/ise/introducing-the-windows-powershell-ise?view=powershell-7)) as an Administrator\n3) Enable PowerShell execution\n<code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force</code>\n4) On the prompt, change to the directory where you extracted the files:\n\u00a0 e.g. - `cd c:\\temp`\n5) Next, to run either script, enter in the following:\n\u00a0 e.g. - `.\\Windows10DebloaterGUI.ps1`\n\n### Second Method\n\n1) Download the .zip file on the main page of the GitHub and extract the .zip file to your desired location\n2) Right-click the PowerShell file that you'd like to run and click on \"Run With PowerShell\"\n3) This will allow the script to run without having to do the above steps but Powershell will ask if you're sure you want to run this script.\n\nRemember this script **NEEDS** to be run as admin in order to function properly.\n\n## How To Run the Windows10SysPrepDebloater.ps1 file\n\nFor the WindowsSysPrepDebloater.ps1 file, there are a couple of parameters that you can run so that you can specify which functions are used. The parameters are:\n`-SysPrep`, `-Debloat` and `-Privacy`.\n\nTo run this with parameters, do the following:\n\n1) Download the .zip file on the main page of the GitHub and extract the .zip file to your desired location\n2) Once extracted, open [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-5.1) (or [PowerShell ISE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/ise/introducing-the-windows-powershell-ise?view=powershell-7)) as an Administrator\n3) On the prompt, change to the directory where you extracted the files:\n\u00a0 e.g. - `cd c:\\temp`\n4) Next, to run either script, enter in the following:\n\n  e.g. - `.\\Windows10SysPrepDebloater.ps1 -Sysprep -Debloat -Privacy`\n\n\n## Sysprep, Interactive, and GUI Application\n\nThere are now 3 versions of **Windows10Debloater** - There is an interactive version, a GUI app version, and a pure silent version.\n\n- **`Windows10SysPrepDebloater.ps1`** -> The silent version now utilizes the switch parameters: -Sysprep, -Debloat -Privacy. The silent version can be useful for deploying MDT Images/sysprepping or any other way you deploy Windows 10. This will work to remove the bloatware during the deployment process.\n\n- **`Windows10Debloater.ps1`** -> This interactive version is what it implies - a Windows10Debloater script with interactive prompts. This one should not be used for deployments that require a silent script with optional parameters. This script gives you choices with prompts as it runs so that you can make the choices of what the script does.\n\n- **`Windows10DebloaterGUI.ps1`** -> There is now a GUI Application named Windows10DebloaterGUI.ps1 with buttons to perform all of the functions that the scripts do. This is better for the average user who does not want to work with code, or if you'd prefer to just see an application screen. \n\n## Switch Parameters\n\nThere are 3 switch parameters in the `Windows10SysPrepDebloater.ps1` script.\n\n- **`-SysPrep`**, which runs the command within a function: get-appxpackage | remove-appxpackage. This is useful since some administrators need that command to run first in order for machines to be able to properly provision the apps for removal.\n\n- **`-Debloat`**, switch parameter which does as it suggests. It runs the following functions: Start-Debloat, Remove-Keys, and Protect-Privacy.\nRemove-Keys removes registry keys leftover that are associated with the bloatware apps listed above, but not removed during the Start-Debloat function.\n\n- **`-Privacy`**, adds and/or changes registry keys to stop some telemetry functions, stops Cortana from being used as your Search Index, disables \"unnecessary\" scheduled tasks, and more.\n\n***This script will remove the bloatware from Windows 10 when using Remove-AppXPackage/Remove-AppXProvisionedPackage, and then delete specific registry keys that are were not removed beforehand. For best results, this script should be run before a user profile is configured, otherwise, you will likely see that apps that should have been removed will remain, and if they are removed you will find broken tiles on the start menu.***\n\n## These registry keys are\n\nEclipseManager,\nActiproSoftwareLLC,\nMicrosoft.PPIProjection,\nMicrosoft.XboxGameCallableUI\n\nYou can choose to either 'Debloat' or 'Revert'. Depending on your choice, either one will run specific code to either debloat your Windows 10 machine.\n\n## The Debloat switch choice runs the following functions\n\nDebloat,\nRemove-Keys,\nProtect-Privacy,\nStop-EdgePDF (If chosen)\n\n## The Revert switch choice runs the following functions\n\nRevert-Changes,\nEnable-EdgePDF\n\nThe Revert option reinstalls the bloatware and changes your registry keys back to default. \n\n## The scheduled tasks that are disabled are\n\nXblGameSaveTaskLogon,\nXblGameSaveTask,\nConsolidator,\nUsbCeip,\nDmClient\n\nThese scheduled tasks that are disabled have absolutely no impact on the function of the OS.\n\n## Bloatware that is removed\n\n[3DBuilder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/3d-builder/9wzdncrfj3t6),\n[ActiproSoftware](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/actipro-universal-windows-controls/9wzdncrdlvzp),\n[Alarms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-alarms-clock/9wzdncrfj3pr?activetab=pivot:overviewtab),\n[Appconnector](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/connector/9wzdncrdjmlj?activetab=pivot:overviewtab),\n[Asphalt8](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/asphalt-8-racing-game-drive-drift-at-real-speed/9wzdncrfj26j?activetab=pivot:overviewtab),\n[Autodesk SketchBook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/autodesk-sketchbook/9nblggh4vzw5),\n[MSN Money](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/msn-money/9wzdncrfhv4v?activetab=pivot:overviewtab),\n[Food And Drink](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/food-and-drink/9nblggh0jhqg),\n[Health And Fitness](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/health-fitness-free/9wzdncrcwcdp),\n[Microsoft News](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-news/9wzdncrfhvfw#activetab=pivot:overviewtab),\n[MSN Sports](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/msn-sports/9wzdncrfhvh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab),\n[MSN Travel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/msn-travel/9wzdncrfj3ft?activetab=pivot:overviewtab),\n[MSN Weather](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/msn-weather/9wzdncrfj3q2?activetab=pivot:overviewtab),\nBioEnrollment,\n[Windows Camera](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-camera/9wzdncrfjbbg#activetab=pivot:overviewtab),\nCandyCrush,\nCandyCrushSoda,\nCaesars Slots Free Casino,\nContactSupport,\nCyberLink MediaSuite Essentials,\nDrawboardPDF,\nDuolingo,\nEclipseManager,\nFacebook,\nFarmVille 2 Country Escape,\nFlipboard,\nFresh Paint,\nGet started,\niHeartRadio,\nKing apps,\nMaps,\nMarch of Empires,\nMessaging,\nMicrosoft Office Hub,\nMicrosoft Solitaire Collection,\nMicrosoft Sticky Notes,\nMinecraft,\nNetflix,\nNetwork Speed Test,\nNYT Crossword,\nOffice Sway,\nOneNote,\nOneConnect,\nPandora,\nPeople,\nPhone,\nPhototastic Collage,\nPicsArt-PhotoStudio,\nPowerBI,\nRoyal Revolt 2,\nShazam,\nSkype for Desktop,\nSoundRecorder,\nTuneInRadio,\nTwitter,\nWindows communications apps,\nWindows Feedback,\nWindows Feedback Hub,\nWindows Reading List,\nXboxApp,\nXbox Game CallableUI,\nXbox Identity Provider,\nZune Music,\nZune Video.\n\n## Quick download link\n\n`iwr -useb https://git.io/debloat|iex`\n\n## Allowlist and Blocklist\nThere may be some confusion, but when using the Allowlist/Blocklist, the checkmark means it is on the blocklist, and that it will be removed.\n\n## Credits\n\nThank you to [a60wattfish](https://github.com/a60wattfish), [abulgatz](abulgatz), [xsisbest](https://github.com/xsisbest), [Damian](https://github.com/Damian), [Vikingat-RAGE](https://github.com/Vikingat-RAGE), Reddit user [/u/GavinEke](https://github.com/GavinEke), and all of the contributors (https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater/graphs/contributors) for the suggestions, code, changes, and fixes that you have all graciously worked hard on and shared!
