        "readme": "Highcharts JS is a JavaScript charting library based on SVG and some canvas/WebGL.\n\n* Official website: [www.highcharts.com](http://www.highcharts.com)\n* Download page: [www.highcharts.com/download](http://www.highcharts.com/download)\n* Licensing: [shop.highcharts.com](https://shop.highcharts.com/)\n* Support: [www.highcharts.com/support](http://www.highcharts.com/support)\n* [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [Repo guidelines](repo-guidelines.md)\n\nHighcharts is a [source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) product. Please refer to [shop.highcharts.com](https://shop.highcharts.com/) for details on licensing.\n\n## Installing and using Highcharts\nThis is the *working repo* for Highcharts code. If you simply want to include Highcharts into a project, use the [distribution package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts) instead, or read the [download page](http://www.highcharts.com/download).\n\nPlease note that there are several ways to use Highcharts. For general installation instructions, see [the docs](http://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/installation).\n\n### Use our CDN\nInstead of downloading, you can use our CDN to access files directly. See [code.highcharts.com](https://code.highcharts.com) for details.\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Install from npm\nSee [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) on how to get started with npm.\n```\nnpm install --save highcharts\n```\n\n### ES6 modules, AMD, CommonJS and others\nFor other ways to use Highcharts in your projects, please refer to our [installation docs](http://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/installation).\n\n## Create your own custom build of Highcharts\nTo reduce file size, or combine modules into one file to reduce latency, you may\nwant to create your own build of the Highcharts modules. See [Creating custom\nHighcharts files](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/how-to-create-custom-highcharts-packages)\nfor more information.\n\n## Build and debug\nIf you want to do modifications to Highcharts or fix issues, you may build your own files. Highcharts uses Gulp as the build system. After `npm install` in the root folder, run `gulp`, which will set up a watch task for the JavaScript and CSS files. Now any changes in the files of the `/js` or `/css` folders will result in new files being built and saved in the `code` folder. Other tasks are also available, like `gulp lint`.\n\n```\nnpm install\ngulp\n```\n\n### Node setup for Apple Mx CPU\n\nWhen running Node natively on ARM64 MacOS, some Node packages like [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#compiling) with integrated compiling might fail. Install additional tools to resolve the problem:\n\n- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run `brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman`\n\n## Generate API docs\nRun in this `highcharts` repository the doc generator with\n`npx gulp jsdoc-watch`, which also starts a new server with the generated API\ndocumentation.\n",
