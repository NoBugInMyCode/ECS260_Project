It focuses on **privacy**, **longevity**, and [**user control**](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). Logseq offers a range of **powerful tools** for **knowledge management**, **collaboration**, **PDF annotation**, and **task management** with support for multiple file formats, including **Markdown** and **Org-mode**, and **various features** for organizing and structuring your notes.\n\nLogseq's **Whiteboard** feature lets you organize your knowledge and ideas using a spatial **canvas** with **shapes**, **drawings**, **website embeds**, and **connectors**. You can **visually group** and **link** your **notes** and external media (such as **videos** and **images**), enabling visual thinkers to compose, remix, **annotate**, and connect content from their knowledge base and emerging thoughts in a new way.\n\nIn addition to its core features, Logseq has a growing ecosystem of **plugins** and **themes** that enable a wide range of workflows and **customization** options. **Mobile apps** are also available, providing access to most of the features of the desktop application. Whether you're a student, a professional, or anyone who values a clear and organized approach to managing your ideas and notes, Logseq is an excellent choice for anyone looking to improve their productivity and streamline their workflow.\n\n![logseq-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25513724/221387376-4dc419c2-0d0a-460c-a920-2d211e78b456.gif)\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/logseq/logseq/releases/latest/\">\n        <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Download_Logseq-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=flatpak&logoColor=white&labelColor=002b36&color=85c8c8\"\n            align=\"right\"\n            alt=\"Download Logseq\"/></a>\n\n## \ud83d\udc40 How can I use it?\n\nTo start using Logseq, follow these simple steps:\n\n1.
