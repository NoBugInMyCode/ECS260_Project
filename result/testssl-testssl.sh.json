No gems, CPAN, pip or the like.\n* Works out of the box: Linux, OSX/Darwin, FreeBSD, NetBSD, MSYS2/Cygwin, WSL (bash on Windows). Only OpenBSD needs bash.\n* A Dockerfile is provided, there's also an official container build @ dockerhub.\n* Flexibility: You can test any SSL/TLS enabled and STARTTLS service, not only web servers at port 443.\n* Toolbox: Several command line options help you to run *your* test and configure *your* output.\n* Reliability: features are tested thoroughly.\n* Privacy: It's only you who sees the result, not a third party.\n* Freedom: It's 100% open source. You can look at the code, see what's going on.\n* The development is open (GitHub) and participation is welcome.\n\n### License\n\nThis software is free. You can use it under the terms of GPLv2, see LICENSE.\n\nAttribution is important for the future of this project -- also in the\ninternet. Thus if you're offering a scanner based on testssl.sh as a public and/or\npaid service in the internet you are strongly encouraged to mention to your audience\nthat you're using this program and where to get this program from. That helps us\nto get bugfixes, other feedback and more contributions.\n\n### Compatibility\n\nTestssl.sh is working on every Linux/BSD distribution out of the box. Latest by 2.9dev\nmost of the limitations of disabled features from the openssl client are gone\ndue to bash-socket-based checks. As a result you can also use e.g. LibreSSL or OpenSSL >=\n1.1.1 . testssl.sh also works on other unixoid systems out of the box, supposed they have\n`/bin/bash` >= version 3.2 and standard tools like sed and awk installed. An implicit\n(silent) check for binaries is done when you start testssl.sh . System V needs probably\nto have GNU grep installed. MacOS X and Windows (using MSYS2, Cygwin or WSL) work too.\n\nUpdate notification here or @ [mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@testssl or [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/testssl.bsky.social). Please note the [twitter](https://twitter.com/drwetter) account is not being used anymore.\n\n### Installation\n\nYou can download testssl.sh branch 3.2 just by cloning this git repository:\n\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh.git\n\n3.2 is now the latest branch which evolved from 3.1dev. It's in the release candidate phase and considered as stable.\nFor the former stable version named oldstable please help yourself by downloading the [ZIP](https://codeload.github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/zip/v3.0.9) or [tar.gz](https://codeload.github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/tar.gz/v3.0.9) archive. Just ``cd`` to the directory created (=INSTALLDIR) and run it off there.\n\n#### Docker\n\nTestssl.sh has minimal requirements. As stated you don't have to install or build anything. You can just run it from the pulled/cloned directory. Still if you don't want to pull the GitHub repo to your directory of choice you can pull a container from dockerhub and run it:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -ti  drwetter/testssl.sh <your_cmd_line>\n```\n\nOr if you have cloned this repo you also can just ``cd`` to the INSTALLDIR and run\n```\ndocker build . -t imagefoo && docker run --rm -t imagefoo example.com\n```\n\nFor more please consult [Dockerfile.md](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/3.2/Dockerfile.md).\n\n### No Warranty\n\nUsage of the program is without any warranty. Use it at your own risk.\n\nTestssl.sh is intended to be used as a standalone CLI tool. While we tried to apply best practise security measures, we can't guarantee that the program is without any vulnerabilities. Running as a service may pose security risks and you're recommended to apply additional security measures.\n\n### Status\n\nWe're currently in the release candidate phase for version 3.2. You should use it despite the label \"RC\". Bigger features will be developed in a separate branch before merged into a 3.3dev to avoid hiccups or inconsistencies.\n\nVersion 3.0.X receives bugfixes, labeled as 3.0.1, 3.0.2 and so on. This will happen until 3.2 is finally released.\n\nSupport for 2.9.5 has been dropped. Supported is >= 3.0.x only.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* .. it is there for reading. Please do so :-) -- at least before asking questions. See man page in groff, html and markdown format in `~/doc/`.\n* [https://testssl.sh/](https://testssl.sh/) will help to get you started.\n* For the (older) version 2.8, Will Hunt provides a longer [description](https://www.4armed.com/blog/doing-your-own-ssl-tls-testing/), including useful background information.\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/3.2/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details. Please also have a look at the [Coding Convention](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/3.2/Coding_Convention.md). A lot of contributors already helped to push the project where it currently is, see [CREDITS.md](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/3.2/CREDITS.md). We still you use your help now. A start would be look for issues which are labeled as [good first issue](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), [for grabs](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22for+grabs%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). The latter is more advanced.\n\nIn general there's some maintenance burden, like maintaining handshakes and CA stores, writing unit tests, improving github actions. If you believe you can contribute, speak up.\n\n\n### Bug reports\n\nBug reports are important. It makes this project more robust.\n\nPlease file bugs in the issue tracker @ GitHub. Do not forget to provide detailed information, see template for issue, and further details @\nhttps://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/wiki/Bug-reporting. Nobody can read your thoughts -- yet. And only agencies your screen ;-)\n\nYou can also debug yourself, see [here](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/wiki/Findings-and-HowTo-Fix-them).\n\n----\n\n### External/related projects\n\nPlease address questions not specifically to the code of testssl.sh to the respective projects below.\n\n#### Web frontend\n* https://github.com/johannesschaefer/webnettools\n* https://github.com/TKCERT/testssl.sh-webfrontend\n\n#### Free to use Web frontend + commercial API\n* https://inspect.rapydblok.com (see also https://inspect.rapydblok.com/about)\n\n#### Mass scanner w parallel scans and elastic searching the results\n* https://github.com/TKCERT/testssl.sh-masscan\n\n#### Privacy checker using testssl.sh\n* https://privacyscore.org\n\n#### Nagios / Icinga Plugins\n* https://github.com/dnmvisser/nagios-testssl (Python 3)\n* https://gitgud.malvager.net/Wazakindjes/icinga2_plugins/src/master/check_testssl.sh (Shell)\n\n#### Brew package\n\n* see [#233](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/issues/233) and\n  [https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew)\n\n#### Daemon for batch execution of testssl.sh command files\n* https://github.com/bitsofinfo/testssl.sh-processor\n\n#### Daemon for batch processing of testssl.sh JSON result files for sending Slack alerts, reactive copying etc\n* https://github.com/bitsofinfo/testssl.sh-alerts\n\n#### GitHub Actions\n* https://github.com/marketplace/actions/testssl-sh-scan\n",
