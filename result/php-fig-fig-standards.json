        "readme": "PHP Framework Interoperability Group\n====================================\n\nThe idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the\ncommonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together. Our main\naudience is each other, but we\u2019re very aware that the rest of the PHP community\nis watching. If other folks want to adopt what we\u2019re doing they are welcome to\ndo so, but that is not the aim.\n\nProposing a Standard Recommendation\n------------------------------------\n\nTo propose a PHP Standard Recommendation (PSR):\n\n- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, add the PSR in\n  `proposed/`, push the branch to GitHub, and send a pull request; or,\n\n- create a ticket to start a discussion on GitHub; or,\n\n- start a conversation on the [mailing list][].\n\n[mailing list]: http://groups.google.com/group/php-fig/\n\nGitHub usage\n------------\n\nAll discussion regarding a PSR happens on the [mailing list][]. Issues filed\nin GitHub are rarely monitored, and PRs are likely to be missed unless a message\nis sent to the mailing list regarding them.  Reviews of a proposed PSR should be\nconducted on the mailing list, not through PR comments for the same reason.\n\nPlease do not simply file an issue or PR and walk-away.  The most likely outcome\nis that it will never get seen or addressed.\n\nRequesting Membership\n---------------------\n\nYou **do not** need to be a voting member to participate in discussion on\nthe [mailing list][].\n\nTo become a voting member, you must send an email to the [mailing list][].\n\n- The subject line should read: `Membership Request: {$your_name} ({$project_name})`\n\n- The body should include your name, the name of (and link to) the project you\n  represent, and other details you feel are relevant.\n\n- Current members will vote on your request.\n\nDo not combine separate membership requests in a single thread; one request\nper thread, please.\n\nLanguage & Translations\n-----------------------\n\nAll PSRs are written in British English or American English (Different specifications\nmay vary, but it is consistent within the same specification). The PHP FIG does not\noffer official translations into other languages but other external entities are free\nto translate the specifications in accordance with the license.\n\nVoting Members\n--------------\n\nThe current list of voting members is available on the [project website][].\n\n[project website]: https://www.php-fig.org/\n",
