This material can be used as a reference manual for developers, or you can refresh specific topics before an interview. Also, you can find ideas to solve problems more efficiently.\n\n<!-- (Check out the Time Complexity Cheatsheet) -->\n\n\n<!--\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/amejiarosario/dsa.js-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-javascript.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/amejiarosario/dsa.js-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-javascript)\n[![Code Style Airbnb](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-Airbnb-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)\n[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](http://makeapullrequest.com)\n[![ProductHunt](https://img.shields.io/badge/product%20hunt-vote-orange.svg)](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dsa-js)\nhttps://bundlephobia.com/result?p=dsa.js\nhttps://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/dsa.js.svg - 16.7kB\nhttps://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/amejiarosario/dsa.js.svg - 98.1 MB\n-->\n\n![Interactive Data Structures](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/418605/46118890-ba721180-c1d6-11e8-82bc-6a671428b422.png)\n<!-- [](https://embed.kumu.io/85f1a4de5fb8430a10a1bf9c5118e015) -->\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [What's Inside](#whats-inside)\n  - [\ud83d\udcc8 Algorithms Analysis](#-algorithms-analysis)\n  - [\ud83e\udd5e Linear Data Structures](#-linear-data-structures)\n  - [\ud83c\udf32 Non-Linear Data Structures](#-non-linear-data-structures)\n  - [\u2692 Algorithms Techniques](#%E2%9A%92-algorithms-techniques)\n- [Book](#book)\n- [FAQ](#faq)\n- [Support](#support)\n- [License](#license)\n\n\n<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can clone the repo or install the code from NPM:\n\n```sh\nnpm install dsa.js\n```\n\nand then you can import it into your programs or CLI\n\n```js\nconst { LinkedList, Queue, Stack } = require('dsa.js');\n```\n\nFor a list of all available data structures and algorithms, [see index.js](src/index.js).\n\n\n## Features\n\nAlgorithms are an essential toolbox for every programmer.\n\nYou will need to mind algorithms runtime when you have to sort data, search for a value in a big dataset, transform data, scale your code to many users, to name a few.\nAlgorithms are just the step you follow to solve a problem, while data structures are where you store the data for later manipulation. Both combined create programs.\n\n> Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.\n\nMost programming languages and libraries indeed provide implementations for basic data structures and algorithms.\nHowever, to make use of data structures properly, you have to know the tradeoffs to choose the best tool for the job.\n\nThis material is going to teach you to:\n\n- \ud83d\udee0 Apply strategies to tackle algorithm questions. Never to get stuck again. Ace those interviews!\n- \u2702\ufe0f Construct efficient algorithms. Learn how to break down problems into manageable pieces.\n- \ud83e\udde0 Improve your problem-solving skills and become a well-rounded developer by understanding fundamental computer science concepts.\n- \ud83e\udd13 Cover essential topics, such as big O time, data structures, and must-know algorithms. Implement 10+ data structures from scratch.\n\n## What's Inside\n\nAll the code and explanations are available on this repo. You can dig through the links and code examples from the ([src folder](src)). However, the inline code examples are not expanded (because of Github's asciidoc limitations), but you can follow the path and see the implementation.\n\n_Note: If you prefer to consume the information more linearly, then the [book format](https://books.adrianmejia.com/dsajs-data-structures-algorithms-javascript/) would be more appropriate for you._\n\nThe topics are divided into four main categories, as you can see below:\n\n\n### \ud83d\udcc8 [Algorithms Analysis](book/part01-algorithms-analysis.asc)\n\n<!-- - Computer Science nuggets without all the mumbo-jumbo.\n- Learn how to compare algorithms using Big O notation.\n- 8 examples to explain with code how to calculate time complexity. -->\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    Computer Science nuggets without all the mumbo-jumbo. <i>(Click to expand)</i>\n  </summary>\n\n---\n\n### [Computer Science nuggets without all the mumbo-jumbo](book/content/part01/algorithms-analysis.asc)\n\n#### Learn to calculate run time from code examples\n\n![Translating lines of code to an approximate number of operations](book/images/image4.png)\n\n---\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    Learn how to compare algorithms using Big O notation. <i>(Click to expand)</i>\n  </summary>\n\n---\n\n### [Learn how to compare algorithms using Big O notation.](book/content/part01/big-o-examples.asc#finding-if-an-array-is-empty)\n\n#### Comparing algorithms using Big O notation\n\nLet's say you want to find the duplicates on an array.\nUsing Big O notation, we can compare different solutions that solve the same problem but has a massive difference in how long it takes to do it.\n\n- [Optimal solution using a map](book/content/part01/big-o-examples.asc#linear-example)\n- [Finding duplicates in an array (na\u00efve approach)](book/content/part01/big-o-examples.asc#quadratic-example)\n\n---\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    8 examples to explain with code how to calculate time complexity. <i>(Click to expand)</i>\n  </summary>\n\n---\n\n[8 examples to explain with code how to calculate time complexity](book/content/part01/big-o-examples.asc#summary)\n\n#### Most common time complexities\n\n[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/418605/59617342-2a715080-90f4-11e9-9de9-9315fb0133f9.png)](book/content/part01/big-o-examples.asc#summary)\n\n<!-- - Constant time: _O(1)_\n- Logarithmic time: _O(log n)_\n- Linear time: _O(n)_\n- Linearithmic time: _O(n log n)_\n- Quadratic time: _O(n^2^)_\n- Cubic time: _O(n^3^)_\n- Exponential time: _O(2^n^)_\n- Factorial time: _O(n!)_ -->\n\n#### Time complexity graph\n\n![Most common time complexities](book/images/image5.png)\n\n---\n\n</details>\n</blockquote>\n\n### \ud83e\udd5e [Linear Data Structures](book/part02-linear-data-structures.asc)\n\n<!-- - Understand the ins and outs of the most common data structures.\n- When to use an Array or Linked List.
