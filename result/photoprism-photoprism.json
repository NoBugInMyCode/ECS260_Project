It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.\n\nThe [stable releases](https://docs.photoprism.app/release-notes/) and [development preview](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/updates/#development-preview) are available as a [multi-arch image](https://link.photoprism.app/docker-hub) for 64-bit AMD, Intel, and ARM processors.\nThat means, [Raspberry Pi](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/) and Apple Silicon users enjoy the exact same functionality and can follow the same [installation steps](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/).\n\nSee our [Getting Started FAQ](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-install-photoprism-without-docker) for alternative installation methods, for example using the [*tar.gz* packages](https://dl.photoprism.app/pkg/linux/README.html) we provide.\n\n## Support Our Mission \ud83d\udc8e ##\n\n**PhotoPrism is 100% self-funded and independent.** Your [continued support](https://link.photoprism.app/membership) helps us [provide more features to the public](https://www.photoprism.app/oss/faq#what-functionality-is-generally-available), release [regular updates](https://docs.photoprism.app/release-notes/), and remain independent!\n\nOur members [enjoy additional features](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/personal), including access to [interactive world maps](https://try.photoprism.app/library/places), and can join our private chat room to [connect with our team](https://www.photoprism.app/about/team).

It provides additional motivation to keep going.\n\n**A big thank you to all current and past sponsors, whose generous support has been and continues to be essential to the success of the project!**\n\n[View Sponsors \u203a](SPONSORS.md)\u2003[View Credits \u203a](https://docs.photoprism.app/credits/)\n\n## Getting Support ##\n\nVisit [docs.photoprism.app/user-guide](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/) to learn how to [sync](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/sync/webdav/), [organize](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/library/), and [share](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/share/) your pictures. If you need help installing our software at home, you are welcome to post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) or ask in our [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat).\nCommon problems can be quickly diagnosed and solved using our [Troubleshooting Checklists](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/). Eligible [members](https://link.photoprism.app/membership) are also welcome to email us for technical support and advice.\n\n## Upcoming Features and Enhancements ##\n\nOur [Project Roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap) shows what tasks are in progress and what features will be implemented next. You are invited to give ideas you like a thumbs-up, so we know what's most popular.\n\nBe aware that we have a zero-bug policy and do our best to help users when they need support or have other questions. This comes at a price though, as we can't give exact release dates for new features. Our team receives many more requests than can be implemented, so we want to emphasize that we are in no way obligated to implement the features, enhancements, or other changes you request. We do, however, appreciate your feedback and carefully consider all requests.\n\n**Because sustained funding is key to quickly releasing new features, we encourage you to support our mission by [signing up as a sponsor](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsor) or purchasing a [commercial license](https://www.photoprism.app/teams). Ultimately, that's what's best for the product and the community.**\n\n## GitHub Issues \u26a0\ufe0f ##\n\nWe kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in the app. Thank you for your careful consideration!\n\n- When browsing issues, please note that **our team and all issue subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub whenever a new comment is added, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for [discussions, questions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions), or [expressing personal opinions](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct)\n- In order for us to investigate [new bug reports](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs), they must include **a complete list of steps to reproduce the problem**, the software versions used and information about the environment in which the problem occurred, such as [browser type, browser version, browser plug-ins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, [storage type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#storage), [processor type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#server-cpu), and [memory size](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#memory)\n- [Contact us](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) or [a community member](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works\n- This gives us the opportunity to [improve our documentation](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support instead of dealing with unclear/duplicate bug reports or triggering a flood of notifications by replying to comments\n\n## Connect with the Community ##\n\nFollow us on [Mastodon](https://floss.social/@photoprism), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/photoprism.app), or join the [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat) to get regular updates, connect with other users, and discuss your ideas. Our [Code of Conduct](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct) explains the \"dos and don\u2019ts\" when interacting with other community members.\n\nAs a [contributor](CONTRIBUTING.md), you are also welcome to [contact us directly](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) if you have something on your mind that you don't want to discuss publicly. Please note, however, that due to the high volume of emails we receive, our team may be unable to get back to you immediately. We do our best to respond within five business days or less.\n\n## Every Contribution Makes a Difference ##\n\nWe welcome [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) of any kind, including blog posts, tutorials, translations, testing, writing documentation, and pull requests. Our [Developer Guide](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/) contains all the information necessary for you to get started.\n\n----\n\n*PhotoPrism\u00ae is a [registered trademark](https://www.photoprism.app/trademark).
