This project is a monorepo, and the packages (including the demos) require the packages to first be built.\n\n\nTake a look at the [diagram demos](https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams/tree/master/diagrams-demo-gallery/demos)\n\n**or**\n\nTake a look at the [demo project](https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams/tree/master/diagrams-demo-project) which contains an example for ES6 as well as Typescript\n\n**or**\n\n[Checkout the docs](https://projectstorm.gitbook.io/react-diagrams/)\n\n## Run the demos\n\nAfter running `pnpm install` and `pnpm build`, you must then run: `cd diagrams-demo-gallery && pnpm run start`\n\n## Building from source\n\nSimply run `pnpm` then `pnpm build` or `pnpm build:prod` in the root directory and it will spit out the transpiled code and typescript definitions into the dist directory as a single file.\n\n## Built with react-diagrams\n\n> Do you have an interesting project built with *react-diagrams*? PR it into this section for others to see.\n",
