The only PHP function that supports this directly is [`mail()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php). However, it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as encryption, authentication, HTML messages, and attachments.\n\nFormatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad overlapping (and conflicting) standards, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules \u2013 the vast majority of code that you'll find online that uses the `mail()` function directly is just plain wrong, if not unsafe!\n\nThe PHP `mail()` function usually sends via a local mail server, typically fronted by a `sendmail` binary on Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms, however, Windows usually doesn't include a local mail server; PHPMailer's integrated SMTP client allows email sending on all platforms without needing a local mail server. Be aware though, that the `mail()` function should be avoided when possible; it's both faster and [safer](https://exploitbox.io/paper/Pwning-PHP-Mail-Function-For-Fun-And-RCE.html) to use SMTP to localhost.\n\n*Please* don't be tempted to do it yourself \u2013 if you don't use PHPMailer, there are many other excellent libraries that\nyou should look at before rolling your own. Try [SwiftMailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/)\n, [Laminas/Mail](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-mail/), [ZetaComponents](https://github.com/zetacomponents/Mail), etc.\n\n## License\nThis software is distributed under the [LGPL 2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html) license, along with the [GPL Cooperation Commitment](https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/). Please read [LICENSE](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/LICENSE) for information on the software availability and distribution.\n\n## Installation & loading\nPHPMailer is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpmailer/phpmailer) (using semantic versioning), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install PHPMailer. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:\n\n```json\n\"phpmailer/phpmailer\": \"^6.9.2\"\n```\n\nor run\n\n```sh\ncomposer require phpmailer/phpmailer\n```\n\nNote that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of PHPMailer.\n\nIf you want to use XOAUTH2 authentication, you will also need to add a dependency on the `league/oauth2-client` and appropriate service adapters package in your `composer.json`, or take a look at\nby @decomplexity's [SendOauth2 wrapper](https://github.com/decomplexity/SendOauth2), especially if you're using Microsoft services.\n\nAlternatively, if you're not using Composer, you\ncan [download PHPMailer as a zip file](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), (note that docs and examples are not included in the zip file), then copy the contents of the PHPMailer folder into one of the `include_path` directories specified in your PHP configuration and load each class file manually:\n\n```php\n<?php\nuse PHPMailer\\PHPMailer\\PHPMailer;\nuse PHPMailer\\PHPMailer\\Exception;\n\nrequire 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/Exception.php';\nrequire 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/PHPMailer.php';\nrequire 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/SMTP.php';\n```\n\nIf you're not using the `SMTP` class explicitly (you're probably not), you don't need a `use` line for the SMTP class. Even if you're not using exceptions, you do still need to load the `Exception` class as it is used internally.\n\n## Legacy versions\nPHPMailer 5.2 (which is compatible with PHP 5.0 \u2014 7.0) is no longer supported, even for security updates. You will find the latest version of 5.2 in the [5.2-stable branch](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/5.2-stable). If you're using PHP 5.5 or later (which you should be), switch to the 6.x releases.\n\n### Upgrading from 5.2\nThe biggest changes are that source files are now in the `src/` folder, and PHPMailer now declares the namespace `PHPMailer\\PHPMailer`. This has several important effects \u2013 [read the upgrade guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/UPGRADING.md) for more details.\n\n### Minimal installation\nWhile installing the entire package manually or with Composer is simple, convenient, and reliable, you may want to include only vital files in your project. At the very least you will need [src/PHPMailer.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/PHPMailer.php). If you're using SMTP, you'll need [src/SMTP.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/SMTP.php), and if you're using POP-before SMTP (*very* unlikely!), you'll need [src/POP3.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/POP3.php). You can skip the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder if you're not showing errors to users and can make do with English-only errors. If you're using XOAUTH2 you will need [src/OAuth.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/OAuth.php) as well as the Composer dependencies for the services you wish to authenticate with. Really, it's much easier to use Composer!\n\n## A Simple Example\n\n```php\n<?php\n//Import PHPMailer classes into the global namespace\n//These must be at the top of your script, not inside a function\nuse PHPMailer\\PHPMailer\\PHPMailer;\nuse PHPMailer\\PHPMailer\\SMTP;\nuse PHPMailer\\PHPMailer\\Exception;\n\n//Load Composer's autoloader\nrequire 'vendor/autoload.php';\n\n//Create an instance; passing `true` enables exceptions\n$mail = new PHPMailer(true);\n\ntry {\n    //Server settings\n    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER;                      //Enable verbose debug output\n    $mail->isSMTP();                                            //Send using SMTP\n    $mail->Host       = 'smtp.example.com';                     //Set the SMTP server to send through\n    $mail->SMTPAuth   = true;                                   //Enable SMTP authentication\n    $mail->Username   = 'user@example.com';                     //SMTP username\n    $mail->Password   = 'secret';                               //SMTP password\n    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS;            //Enable implicit TLS encryption\n    $mail->Port       = 465;                                    //TCP port to connect to; use 587 if you have set `SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS`\n\n    //Recipients\n    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');\n    $mail->addAddress('joe@example.net', 'Joe User');     //Add a recipient\n    $mail->addAddress('ellen@example.com');               //Name is optional\n    $mail->addReplyTo('info@example.com', 'Information');\n    $mail->addCC('cc@example.com');\n    $mail->addBCC('bcc@example.com');\n\n    //Attachments\n    $mail->addAttachment('/var/tmp/file.tar.gz');         //Add attachments\n    $mail->addAttachment('/tmp/image.jpg', 'new.jpg');    //Optional name\n\n    //Content\n    $mail->isHTML(true);                                  //Set email format to HTML\n    $mail->Subject = 'Here is the subject';\n    $mail->Body    = 'This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>';\n    $mail->AltBody = 'This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients';\n\n    $mail->send();\n    echo 'Message has been sent';\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    echo \"Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}\";\n}\n```\n\nYou'll find plenty to play with in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder, which covers many common scenarios including sending through Gmail, building contact forms, sending to mailing lists, and more.\n\nIf you are re-using the instance (e.g. when sending to a mailing list), you may need to clear the recipient list to avoid sending duplicate messages. See [the mailing list example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/examples/mailing_list.phps) for further guidance.\n\nThat's it. You should now be ready to use PHPMailer!\n\n## Localization\nPHPMailer defaults to English, but in the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder, you'll find many translations for PHPMailer error messages that you may encounter. Their filenames contain [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code for the translations, for example `fr` for French. To specify a language, you need to tell PHPMailer which one to use, like this:\n\n```php\n//To load the French version\n$mail->setLanguage('fr', '/optional/path/to/language/directory/');\n```\n\nWe welcome corrections and new languages \u2013 if you're looking for corrections, run the [Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php) script in the tests folder and it will show any missing translations.\n\n## Documentation\nStart reading at the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki). If you're having trouble, head for [the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting) as it's frequently updated.\n\nExamples of how to use PHPMailer for common scenarios can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder. If you're looking for a good starting point, we recommend you start with [the Gmail example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples/gmail.phps).\n\nTo reduce PHPMailer's deployed code footprint, examples are not included if you load PHPMailer via Composer or via [GitHub's zip file download](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), so you'll need to either clone the git repository or use the above links to get to the examples directly.\n\nComplete generated API documentation is [available online](https://phpmailer.github.io/PHPMailer/).\n\nYou can generate complete API-level documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder, and documentation will appear in the `docs` folder, though you'll need to have [PHPDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org) installed. You may find [the unit tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/PHPMailer/PHPMailerTest.php) a good reference for how to do various operations such as encryption.\n\nIf the documentation doesn't cover what you need, search the [many questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpmailer), and before you ask a question about \"SMTP Error: Could not connect to SMTP host.\", [read the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting).\n\n## Tests\n[PHPMailer tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/test/) use PHPUnit 9, with [a polyfill](https://github.com/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills) to let 9-style tests run on older PHPUnit and PHP versions.\n\n[![Test status](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/actions)\n\nIf this isn't passing, is there something you can do to help?\n\n## Security\nPlease disclose any vulnerabilities found responsibly \u2013 report security issues to the maintainers privately.\n\nSee [SECURITY](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/SECURITY.md) and [PHPMailer's security advisories on GitHub](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/security). \n\n## Contributing\nPlease submit bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/issues).\n\nWe're particularly interested in fixing edge cases, expanding test coverage, and updating translations.\n\nIf you found a mistake in the docs, or want to add something, go ahead and amend the wiki \u2013 anyone can edit it.\n\nIf you have git clones from prior to the move to the PHPMailer GitHub organisation, you'll need to update any remote URLs referencing the old GitHub location with a command like this from within your clone:\n\n```sh\ngit remote set-url upstream https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer.git\n```\n\nPlease *don't* use the SourceForge or Google Code projects any more; they are obsolete and no longer maintained.\n\n## Sponsorship\nDevelopment time and resources for PHPMailer are provided by [Smartmessages.net](https://info.smartmessages.net/), the world's only privacy-first email marketing system.\n\n<a href=\"https://info.smartmessages.net/\"><img src=\"https://www.smartmessages.net/img/smartmessages-logo.svg\" width=\"550\" alt=\"Smartmessages.net privacy-first email marketing logo\"></a>\n\nDonations are very welcome, whether in beer \ud83c\udf7a, T-shirts \ud83d\udc55, or cold, hard cash \ud83d\udcb0.
