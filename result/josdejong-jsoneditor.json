It has various modes such as a tree editor, a code editor, and a plain text editor. The editor can be used as a component in your own web application. It can be loaded as CommonJS module, AMD module, or as a regular javascript file.\n\nThe library was originally developed as core component of the popular web application https://jsoneditoronline.org and has been open sourced since then.\n\nSupported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.\n\n<img alt=\"json editor\" src=\"https://raw.github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/master/misc/jsoneditor.png\"> &nbsp; <img alt=\"code editor\" src=\"https://raw.github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/master/misc/codeeditor.png\">\n\nCross browser testing for JSONEditor is generously provided by <a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com\" target=\"_blank\">BrowserStack</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"BrowserStack\" src=\"https://raw.github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/master/misc/browserstack.png\"></a>\n\n## Successor: svelte-jsoneditor\n\nThis library [`jsoneditor`](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor) has a successor: [`svelte-jsoneditor`](https://github.com/josdejong/svelte-jsoneditor). The new editor is not a one-to-one replacement, so there may be reasons to stick with `jsoneditor`. \nThe main differences between the two [are described here](https://github.com/josdejong/svelte-jsoneditor#differences-between-josdejongsvelte-jsoneditor-and-josdejongjsoneditor).\n\n## Features\n\nJSONEditor has various modes, with the following features.\n\n### Tree mode\n\n- Change, add, move, remove, and duplicate fields and values.\n- Sort arrays and objects.\n- Transform JSON using [JMESPath](http://jmespath.org/) queries.\n- Colorized code.\n- Color picker.\n- Search & highlight text in the tree view.\n- Undo and redo all actions.\n- JSON schema validation (powered by [ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv)).\n\n### Code mode\n\n- Colorized code (powered by [Ace](https://ace.c9.io)).\n- Inspect JSON (powered by [Ace](https://ace.c9.io)).\n- Format and compact JSON.\n- Repair JSON.\n- JSON schema validation (powered by [ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv)).\n\n### Text mode\n\n- Format and compact JSON.\n- Repair JSON.\n- JSON schema validation (powered by [ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv)).\n\n### Preview mode\n\n- Handle large JSON documents up to 500 MiB.\n- Transform JSON using [JMESPath](http://jmespath.org/) queries.\n- Format and compact JSON.\n- Repair JSON.\n- JSON schema validation (powered by [ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv)).\n\n## Documentation\n\n- Documentation:\n  - [API](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/tree/master/docs/api.md)\n  - [Usage](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/tree/master/docs/usage.md)\n  - [Shortcut keys](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/tree/master/docs/shortcut_keys.md)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/tree/master/examples)\n- [Source](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor)\n- [History](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/blob/master/HISTORY.md)\n\n\n## Install\n\nwith npm (recommended):\n\n    npm install jsoneditor\n\nAlternatively, you can use another JavaScript package manager like https://yarnpkg.com/, or a CDN such as https://cdnjs.com/ or https://www.jsdelivr.com/.\n\n## Use\n\n> Note that in the following example, you'll have to change the urls `jsoneditor/dist/jsoneditor.min.js` and `jsoneditor/dist/jsoneditor.min.css` to match the place where you've downloaded the library, or fill in the URL of the CDN you're using.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <!-- when using the mode \"code\", it's important to specify charset utf-8 -->\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n\n    <link href=\"jsoneditor/dist/jsoneditor.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n    <script src=\"jsoneditor/dist/jsoneditor.min.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"jsoneditor\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 400px;\"></div>\n\n    <script>\n        // create the editor\n        const container = document.getElementById(\"jsoneditor\")\n        const options = {}\n        const editor = new JSONEditor(container, options)\n\n        // set json\n        const initialJson = {\n            \"Array\": [1, 2, 3],\n            \"Boolean\": true,\n            \"Null\": null,\n            \"Number\": 123,\n            \"Object\": {\"a\": \"b\", \"c\": \"d\"},\n            \"String\": \"Hello World\"\n        }\n        editor.set(initialJson)\n\n        // get json\n        const updatedJson = editor.get()\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n## Build\n\nThe code of the JSON Editor is located in the folder `./src`. To build \njsoneditor:\n\n- Install dependencies:\n\n  ```\n  npm install\n  ```\n\n- Build JSON Editor:\n\n  ```\n  npm run build\n  ```\n\n  This will generate the files `./jsoneditor.js`, `./jsoneditor.css`, and  \n  minified versions in the dist of the project.\n\n- To automatically build when a source file has changed:\n\n  ```\n  npm start\n  ```\n\n  This will update `./jsoneditor.js` and `./jsoneditor.css` in the dist folder\n  on every change, but it will **NOT** update the minified versions as that's\n  an expensive operation.\n\n\n## Test\n\nRun unit tests:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nRun code linting ([JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/)):\n\n```\nnpm run lint\n```\n\n\n## Custom builds\n\nThe source code of JSONEditor consists of CommonJS modules. JSONEditor can be bundled in a customized way using a module bundler like [browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/). First, install all dependencies of jsoneditor:\n\n    npm install\n\nTo create a custom bundle of the source code using browserify:\n\n    browserify ./index.js -o ./jsoneditor.custom.js -s JSONEditor\n\nThe Ace editor, used in mode `code`, accounts for about one third of the total\nsize of the library. To exclude the Ace editor from the bundle:\n\n    browserify ./index.js -o ./jsoneditor.custom.js -s JSONEditor -x brace -x brace/mode/json -x brace/ext/searchbox\n\nTo minify the generated bundle, use [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2):\n\n    uglifyjs ./jsoneditor.custom.js -o ./jsoneditor.custom.min.js -m -c\n\n\n## License\n\n`jsoneditor` is released as open source under the permissive the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.md).\n\n**If you are using jsoneditor commercially, there is a _social_ (but no legal) expectation that you help fund its maintenance.
