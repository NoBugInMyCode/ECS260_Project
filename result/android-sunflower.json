        "readme": "# Android Sunflower with Compose\n\nWarning: The Sunflower repository is no longer under maintenance, We are prioritizing https://github.com/android/compose-samples as the up-to-date source of truth for Compose best practises. Please use that repository and sample set to continue learning about Jetpack Compose. If you'd like to continue using Sunflower, we encourage you to maintain your own fork of the sample. \n\nA gardening app illustrating Android development best practices with migrating a View-based app to\nJetpack Compose. To learn about how Sunflower was migrated to Compose, see the \n[migration journey](https://github.com/android/sunflower/blob/main/docs/MigrationJourney.md) document.\n\n> [!Note]\n> To see the original View implementation of Sunflower, checkout the [`views`](https://github.com/android/sunflower/tree/views) branch.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<img src=\"screenshots/SunflowerM3Screenshots.png\"/>\n\n## Features\n\nThis sample showcases how to migrate an existing View-based app (Material 2) to Compose (Material 3). \nSee the linked migration journey doc above to learn more.\n\n> [!Note]\n> As Compose cannot render HTML code in `Text` yet. The \n> `AndroidViewBinding` API is used to embed a `TextView` in Compose. See the \n> `PlantDescription` composable in the\n> [PlantDetailView file](app/src/main/java/com/google/samples/apps/sunflower/compose/plantdetail/PlantDetailView.kt).\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Unsplash API key\n\nSunflower uses the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to load pictures on the gallery\nscreen. To use the API, you will need to obtain a free developer API key. See the\n[Unsplash API Documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation) for instructions.\n\nOnce you have the key, add this line to the `gradle.properties` file, either in your user home\ndirectory (usually `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` on Linux and Mac) or in the project's root folder:\n\n```\nunsplash_access_key=<your Unsplash access key>\n```\n\nThe app is still usable without an API key, though you won't be able to navigate to the gallery screen.\n\nAndroid Studio IDE setup\n------------------------\nFor development, the latest version of Android Studio is required. The latest version can be\ndownloaded from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/).\n\nSunflower uses [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) to enforce Kotlin coding styles.\nHere's how to configure it for use with Android Studio (instructions adapted\nfrom the ktlint [README](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md)):\n\n- Close Android Studio if it's open\n\n- Download ktlint using these [installation instructions](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/blob/master/README.md#installation)\n\n- Apply ktlint settings to Android Studio using these [instructions](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/blob/master/README.md#-with-intellij-idea)\n\n- Start Android Studio\n\nAdditional resources\n--------------------\nCheck out these Wiki pages to learn more about Android Sunflower:\n\n- [Notable Community Contributions](https://github.com/android/sunflower/wiki/Notable-Community-Contributions)\n\n- [Publications](https://github.com/android/sunflower/wiki/Sunflower-Publications)\n\nNon-Goals\n---------\nPreviously, this sample app was focused on demonstrating best practices for\nmultiple Jetpack libraries. However, this is no longer the case and development\nwill instead be focused on how to adopt Compose in an existing View-based app.\nSo, there are no plans to implement features outside of this scope. Keep this\nin mind when making contributions to this library.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\n- Stack Overflow:\n  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android-jetpack-compose\n\nIf you've found an error in this sample, please file an issue:\nhttps://github.com/android/sunflower/issues\n\nPatches are encouraged, and may be submitted by forking this project and submitting a pull request\nthrough GitHub.\n\nThird Party Content\n-------------------\nSelect text used for describing the plants (in `plants.json`) are used from Wikipedia via CC BY-SA 3.0 US (license in `ASSETS_LICENSE`).\n\n\"[seed](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=seed&i=1585971)\" by [Aisyah](https://thenounproject.com/aisyahalmasyira/) is licensed under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/legalcode)\n",
