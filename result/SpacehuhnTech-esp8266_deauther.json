It's also a great project for learning about WiFi, microcontrollers, Arduino, hacking and electronics/programming in general.  \n\nThe deauthentication attack is the main feature, which can be used to disconnect devices from their WiFi network.  \nAlthough this denial-of-service attack is nothing new, a lot of devices are still vulnerable to it. Luckily this is slowly changing with more WiFi 6 enabled devices being used. But a lot of outdated WiFi devices remain in place, for example in cheap IoT hardware.\nWith an ESP8266 Deauther, you can easily test this attack on your 2.4GHz WiFi network/devices and see whether it's successful or not. And if it is, you know you should upgrade your network.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis project is a proof of concept for testing and educational purposes.  \nNeither the ESP8266, nor its SDK was meant or built for such purposes. **Bugs can occur!**  \n\n**Use it only against your own networks and devices!**  \nPlease check the legal regulations in your country before using it.  \nWe don't take any responsibility for what you do with this program.
