The Front-End Performance Checklist is an exhaustive list of elements you should check or at least be aware of, as a Front-End developer and apply to your project (personal and professional).\n\n> One simple rule: \"Design and code with performance in mind\"\n\n**Other Checklists:**\n\n- [\ud83d\uddc2 Front-End Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist#front-end-checklist)\n- [\ud83d\udc8e Front-End Design Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Design-Checklist#front-end-design-checklist)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> \u2b50\ufe0f I've recently launched [UX Patterns for Devs](https://git.new/uxpatterns) and a [curated list for indie developers](https://git.new/indiedevtoolkit), feel free to check it out! \u2b50\ufe0f\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Table of Contents\n\n- [How to use?](#how-to-use)\n- [HTML](#html)\n- [CSS](#css)\n- [Fonts](#fonts)\n- [Images](#images)\n- [JavaScript](#javascript)\n- [Performance Tools](#performance-tools)\n- [References](#references)\n\n## How to use?\n\nFor each rule, you will have a paragraph explaining _why_ this rule is important and _how_ you can fix it. For more deep information, you should find links that will point to \ud83d\udee0 tools, \ud83d\udcd6 articles or \ud83d\udcf9 medias that can complete the checklist.\n\nAll items in the **Front-End Performance Checklist** are essentials to achieve the highest performance score but you would find an indicator to help you to eventually prioritised some rules amount others. There are 3 levels of priority:\n\n- ![Low][low] means that the item has a **low** priority.\n- ![Medium][medium] means that the item has a **medium** priority. You shouldn't avoid tackling that item.\n- ![High][high] means that the item has a **high** priority. You can't avoid following that rule and implement the corrections recommended.\n\n### Performance tools\n\nList of the tools you can use to test or monitor your website or application:\n\n- \ud83d\udee0 [WebPagetest - Website Performance and Optimization Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 \u2606 [Dareboost: Website Speed Test and Website Analysis](https://www.dareboost.com/) (use the coupon WPCDD20 for -20%)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Treo: Page Speed Monitoring](https://treo.sh/?ref=perfchecklist)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [GTmetrix | Website Speed and Performance Optimization](https://gtmetrix.com/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Web.dev](https://web.dev/measure)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Pingdom Website Speed Test](https://tools.pingdom.com)\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [Make the Web Faster\u00a0| Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/speed/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Sitespeed.io - Welcome to the wonderful world of Web Performance](https://www.sitespeed.io/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Website Speed Test | Check Web Performance &raquo; Dotcom-Tools](https://www.dotcom-tools.com/website-speed-test.aspx)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Website and Server Uptime Monitoring - Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/product/uptime-monitoring/) ([Free Signup Link](https://www.pingdom.com/free))\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [SpeedCurve: Monitor front-end performance](https://speedcurve.com)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [PWMetrics - CLI tool and lib to gather performance metrics](https://github.com/paulirish/pwmetrics)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Lighthouse - Google](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#devtools)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Checkbot browser extension - Checks for web performance best practices](https://www.checkbot.io/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Yellow Lab Tools | Online test to help speeding up heavy web pages](https://yellowlab.tools/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Speedrank - Web Performance Monitoring](https://speedrank.app/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [DebugBear - Monitor website performance and Lighthouse scores](https://www.debugbear.com/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [packtracker.io - Check your webpack bundle size on every pull request.](https://packtracker.io/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Exthouse - Analyze the impact of a browser extension on web performance](https://github.com/treosh/exthouse)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [LogRocket - Measure front-end performance in production apps](https://logrocket.com)\n\n### References\n\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [The Cost Of JavaScript](https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4)\n- [AddyOsmani.com - Start Performance Budgeting](https://addyosmani.com/blog/performance-budgets/)\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [Get Started With Analyzing Runtime Performance \u00a0|\u00a0 Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/)\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [State of the Web | 2018_01_01](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web?start=2018_01_01)\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [Page Weight Doesn't Matter](https://www.speedshop.co/2015/11/05/page-weight-doesnt-matter.html)\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [Front-End Performance Checklist 2021 [PDF, Apple Pages, MS Word]](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/front-end-performance-2021-free-pdf-checklist/)\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [Designing for Performance Weighing Aesthetics and Speed - By Lara Callender Hogan [eBook, Print]](http://designingforperformance.com/index.html)\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [fabkrum/web-performance-resources: Up to date collection of valuable web performance resources](https://github.com/fabkrum/web-performance-resources)\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [Checkbot - Web Speed Best Practices](https://www.checkbot.io/guide/speed/)\n- \ud83d\udee0 [Progressive Tooling - A list of community-built, third-party tools that can be used to improve page performance](https://progressivetooling.com/)\n\n## HTML\n\n![html]\n\n- [ ] **Minified HTML:** ![medium] The HTML code is minified, comments, white spaces and new lines are removed from production files.\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > Removing all unnecessary spaces, comments and attributes will reduce the size of your HTML and speed up your site's page load times and obviously lighten the download for your user.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > Most of the frameworks have plugins to facilitate the minification of the webpages. You can use a bunch of NPM modules that can do the job for you automatically.\n\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [HTML minifier | Minify Code](http://minifycode.com/html-minifier/)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [Online HTML Compressor](http://refresh-sf.com)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Experimenting with HTML minifier \u2014 Perfection Kills](http://perfectionkills.com/experimenting-with-html-minifier/#use_short_doctype)\n\n- [ ] **Place CSS tags always before JavaScript tags:** ![high] Ensure that your CSS is always loaded before having JavaScript code.\n\n  ```html\n  <!-- Not recommended -->\n  <script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"foo.js\"></script>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"foo.css\" />\n\n  <!-- Recommended -->\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"foo.css\" />\n  <script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"foo.js\"></script>\n  ```\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > Having your CSS tags before any JavaScript enables better, parallel download which speed up browser rendering time.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > \u2043 Ensure that `<link>` and `<style>` in your `<head>` are always before your `<script>`.\n\n- [ ] **Minimize the number of iframes:** ![high] Use iframes only if you don't have any other technical possibility. Try to avoid iframes as much as you can.\n\n- [ ] **Pre-load optimization with prefetch, dns-prefetch and prerender:** ![low] Popular browsers can use directive on `<link>` tag and \"rel\" attribute with certain keywords to pre-load specific URLs.\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > Prefetching allows a browser to silently fetch the necessary resources needed to display content that a user might access in the near future. The browser is able to store these resources in its cache and speed up the way web pages load when they are using different domains for page resources. When a web page has finished loading and the idle time has passed, the browser begins downloading other resources. When a user go in a particular link (already prefetched), the content will be instantly served.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > \u2043 Ensure that `<link>` is in your `<head>` section.\n\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [What Is Prefetching and Why Use It](https://www.keycdn.com/support/prefetching)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Prefetching, preloading, prebrowsing](https://css-tricks.com/prefetching-preloading-prebrowsing/)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [What is Preload, Prefetch, and Preconnect](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/resource-hints)\n\n**[\u2b06 back to top](#-table-of-contents)**\n\n## CSS\n\n![css]\n\n- [ ] **Minification:** ![high] All CSS files are minified, comments, white spaces and new lines are removed from production files.\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > When CSS files are minified, the content is loaded faster and less data is sent to the client. It's important to always minify CSS files in production. It is beneficial for the user as it is for any business who wants to lower bandwidth costs and lower resource usage.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > \u2043 Use tools to minify your files automatically before or during your build or your deployment.\n\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [cssnano: A modular minifier based on the PostCSS ecosystem. - cssnano](https://cssnano.github.io/cssnano/)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [CSS minifier](https://goonlinetools.com/css-minifier/)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [@neutrinojs/style-minify - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neutrinojs/style-minify)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [Online CSS Compressor](http://refresh-sf.com)\n\n- [ ] **Concatenation:** ![medium] CSS files are concatenated in a single file _(Not always valid for HTTP/2)_.\n\n  ```html\n  <!-- Not recommended -->\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"foo.css\" />\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bar.css\" />\n\n  <!-- Recommended -->\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"foobar.css\" />\n  ```\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > If you are still using HTTP/1, you may need to still concatenate your files, it's less true if your server use HTTP/2 (tests should be made).\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > \u2043 Use online tool or any plugin before or during your build or your deployment to concatenate your files. <br>\n  > \u2043 Ensure, of course, that concatenation does not break your project.\n\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [HTTP: Optimizing Application Delivery - High Performance Browser Networking (O'Reilly)](https://hpbn.co/optimizing-application-delivery/#optimizing-for-http2)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Performance Best Practices in the HTTP/2 Era](https://deliciousbrains.com/performance-best-practices-http2/)\n\n- [ ] **Non-blocking:** ![high] CSS files need to be non-blocking to prevent the DOM from taking time to load.\n\n  ```html\n  <link\n    rel=\"preload\"\n    href=\"global.min.css\"\n    as=\"style\"\n    onload=\"this.rel='stylesheet'\"\n  />\n  <noscript><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"global.min.css\" /></noscript>\n  ```\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > CSS files can block the page load and delay the rendering of your page. Using `preload` can actually load the CSS files before the browser starts showing the content of the page.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > \u2043 You need to add the `rel` attribute with the `preload` value and add `as=\"style\"` on the `<link>` element.\n\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [loadCSS by filament group](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Example of preload CSS using loadCSS](https://gist.github.com/thedaviddias/c24763b82b9991e53928e66a0bafc9bf)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Preloading content with rel=\"preload\"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Preload: What Is It Good For? \u2014 Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/preload-what-is-it-good-for/)\n\n- [ ] **Unused CSS:** ![medium] Remove unused CSS selectors.\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > Removing unused CSS selectors can reduce the size of your files and then speed up the load of your assets.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > \u2043 \u26a0\ufe0f Always check if the framework CSS you want to use don't already has a reset / normalize code included. Sometimes you may not need everything that is inside your reset / normalize file.\n\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [UnCSS Online](https://uncss-online.com/)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [PurifyCSS](https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [PurgeCSS](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [Chrome DevTools Coverage](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/devtools-release-notes#coverage)\n\n- [ ] **CSS Critical:** ![high] The CSS critical (or \"above the fold\") collects all the CSS used to render the visible portion of the page. It is embedded before your principal CSS call and between `<style></style>` in a single line (minified if possible).\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > Inlining critical CSS help to speed up the rendering of the web pages reducing the number of requests to the server.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > Generate the CSS critical with online tools or using a plugin like the one that Addy Osmani developed.\n\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Understanding Critical CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/understanding-critical-css/)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [Critical by Addy Osmani on GitHub](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical) automates this.\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Inlining critical CSS for better web performance | Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/inlining-critical-css-for-better-web-performance/)\n    - \ud83d\udee0 [Critical Path CSS Generator - Prioritize above the fold content :: SiteLocity](https://www.sitelocity.com/critical-path-css-generator)\n    - \ud83d\udcd6 [Reduce the size of the above-the-fold content](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/PrioritizeVisibleContent)\n\n- [ ] **Embedded or inline CSS:** ![high] Avoid using embed or inline CSS inside your `<body>` \\_(Not valid for HTTP/2)\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > One of the first reason it's because it's a good practice to **separate content from design**. It also helps you have a more maintainable code and keep your site accessible. But regarding performance, it's simply because it decreases the file-size of your HTML pages and the load time.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > Always use external stylesheets or embed CSS in your `<head>` (and follow the others CSS performance rules)\n\n- [ ] **Analyse stylesheets complexity:** ![high] Analyzing your stylesheets can help you to flag issues, redundancies and duplicate CSS selectors.\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > Sometimes you may have redundancies or validation errors in your CSS, analysing your CSS files and removed these complexities can help you to speed up your CSS files (because your browser will read them faster)\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > Your CSS should be organized, using a CSS preprocessor can help you with that.

It's then good to use WOFF 2.0, WOFF 1.0 as a fallback and TTF.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > Check before buying your new font that the provider gives you the WOFF2 format. If you are using a free font, you can always use Font Squirrel to generate all the formats you need.\n\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [WOFF 2.0 \u2013 Learn more about the next generation Web Font Format and convert TTF to WOFF2](https://gist.github.com/sergejmueller/cf6b4f2133bcb3e2f64a)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [Create Your Own @font-face Kits \u00bb Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [IcoMoon App - Icon Font, SVG, PDF & PNG Generator](https://icomoon.io/app/)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Using @font-face | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/?ref=frontendchecklist)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Can I use...

Your browser had to contact a DNS server and wait for the lookup complete before fetching the resource (fonts, CSS files...). Prefetches and preconnects allow the browser to lookup the DNS information and start establishing a TCP connection to the server hosting the font file. This provides a performance boost because by the time the browser gets around to parsing the css file with the font information and discovering it needs to request a font file from the server, it will already have pre-resolved the DNS information and have an open connection to the server ready in its connection pool.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > \u2043 Before prefetching your webfonts, use webpagetest to evaluate your website <br>\n  > \u2043 Look for teal colored DNS lookups and note the host that are being requested <br>\n  > \u2043 Prefetch your webfonts in your `<head>` and add eventually these hostnames that you should prefetch too\n\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Faster Google Fonts with Preconnect - CDN Planet](https://www.cdnplanet.com/blog/faster-google-webfonts-preconnect/)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Make Your Site Faster with Preconnect Hints | Viget](https://www.viget.com/articles/make-your-site-faster-with-preconnect-hints/)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Ultimate Guide to Browser Hints: Preload, Prefetch, and Preconnect - MachMetrics Speed Blog](https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/guide-to-browser-hints-preload-preconnect-prefetch/)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [A Comprehensive Guide to Font Loading Strategies\u2014zachleat.com](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/#font-face)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [typekit/webfontloader: Web Font Loader gives you added control when using linked fonts via @font-face.](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader)\n\n- [ ] **Webfont size:** ![medium] Webfont sizes don't exceed 300kb (all variants included)\n\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [Font Bytes - Page Weight](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight#bytesFont)\n\n- [ ] **Prevent Flash or Invisible Text:** ![medium] Avoid transparent text until the Webfont is loaded\n\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [`font-display` for the Masses](https://css-tricks.com/font-display-masses/)\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [CSS font-display: The Future of Font Rendering on the Web](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-font-display-future-font-rendering-web/)\n\n**[\u2b06 back to top](#-table-of-contents)**\n\n## Images\n\n![images]\n\n- \ud83d\udcd6 [Image Bytes in 2018](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight#bytesImg)\n\n- [ ] **Images optimization:** ![high] Your images are optimized, compressed without direct impact to the end user.\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > Optimized images load faster in your browser and consume less data.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > \u2043 Try using CSS3 effects when it's possible (instead of a small image) <br>\n  > \u2043 When it's possible, use fonts instead of text encoded in your images <br>\n  > \u2043 Use SVG <br>\n  > \u2043 Use a tool and specify a level compression under 85.\n\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Image Optimization | Web Fundamentals | Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Essential Image Optimization - An eBook by Addy Osmani](https://images.guide/)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [TinyJPG \u2013 Compress JPEG images intelligently](https://tinyjpg.com/)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [Kraken.io - Online Image Optimizer](https://kraken.io/web-interface)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [Compressor.io - optimize and compress JPEG photos and PNG images](https://compressor.io/compress)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [Cloudinary - Image Analysis Tool](https://webspeedtest.cloudinary.com)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [ImageEngine - Image Webpage Loading Test](https://demo.imgeng.in)\n  - \ud83d\udee0 [SVGOMG - Optimize SVG vector graphics files](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)\n\n- [ ] **Images format:** ![high] Choose your image format appropriately.\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > To ensure that your images don't slow your website, choose the format that will correspond to your image.

These images can be animated and modified by CSS.\n\n- [ ] **Images dimensions:** ![medium] Set `width` and `height` attributes on `<img>` if the final rendered image size is known.\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > If height and width are set, the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded. However, without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. The effect will be that the page layout will change during loading (while the images load).\n\n- [ ] **Avoid using Base64 images:** ![medium] You could eventually convert tiny images to base64 but it's actually not the best practice.\n\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Base64 Encoding & Performance, Part 1 and 2 by Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/2017/02/base64-encoding-and-performance/)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [A closer look at Base64 image performance \u2013 The Page Not Found Blog](http://www.andygup.net/a-closer-look-at-base64-image-performance/)\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [When to base64 encode images (and when not to) | David Calhoun](https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2011/when-to-base64-encode-images-and-when-not-to/)\n\n- [ ] **Lazy loading:** ![medium] Offscreen images are loaded lazily (A noscript fallback is always provided).\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > It will improve the response time of the current page and then avoid loading unnecessary images that the user may not need.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > \u2043 Use [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) to identify how many **images are offscreen**. <br>\n  > \u2043 Use a JavaScript plugin like the following to lazyload your images.

The best option is to use external files with `async` or `defer` to avoid blocking the DOM. Another option is to place some scripts inside your `<head>`.

Adding `async` or `defer` are highly recommended if your scripts are placed in the top of your page but less valuable if just before your `</body>` tag. But it's a good practice to always use these attributes to avoid any performance issue.\n\n  _How:_\n\n  > \u2043 Add `async` (if the script don't rely on other scripts) or `defer` (if the script relies upon or relied upon by an async script) as an attribute to your script tag. <br>\n  > \u2043 If you have small scripts, maybe use inline script place above async scripts.\n\n  - \ud83d\udcd6 [Remove Render-Blocking JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/BlockingJS)\n\n- [ ] **Optimized and updated JS libraries:** ![medium] All JavaScript libraries used in your project are necessary (prefer Vanilla JavaScript for simple functionalities), updated to their latest version and don't overwhelm your JavaScript with unnecessary methods.\n\n  _Why:_\n\n  > Most of the time, new versions come with optimization and security fix.
