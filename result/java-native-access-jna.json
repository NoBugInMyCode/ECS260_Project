Please read the [overview](http://java-native-access.github.io/jna/5.16.0/javadoc/overview-summary.html#overview_description).  Questions, comments, or exploratory conversations should begin on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jna-users), although you may find it easier to find answers to already-solved problems on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jna).\n\nJNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries without writing anything but Java code - no JNI or native code is required. This functionality is comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's ctypes.\n\nJNA allows you to call directly into native functions using natural Java method invocation. The Java call looks just like the call does in native code. Most calls require no special handling or configuration; no boilerplate or generated code is required.\n\nJNA uses a small JNI library stub to dynamically invoke native code. The developer uses a Java interface to describe functions and structures in the target native library. This makes it quite easy to take advantage of native platform features without incurring the high overhead of configuring and building JNI code for multiple platforms.  Read this [more in-depth description](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/master/www/FunctionalDescription.md).\n\nWhile significant attention has been paid to performance, correctness and ease of use take priority.\n\nIn addition, JNA includes a platform library with many native functions already mapped as well as a set of utility interfaces that simplify native access.\n\nProjects Using JNA\n==================\nJNA is a mature library with dozens of contributors and hundreds of commercial and non-commercial projects that use it.  If you're using JNA, feel free to [tell us about it](http://groups.google.com/group/jna-users).  Include some details about your company, project name, purpose and size and tell us how you use the library.\n\n- [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org): Large-scale NoSQL data store.\n- [Rococoa](https://github.com/iterate-ch/rococoa): Java bindings to the Mac OS X Cocoa framework, by Duncan McGregor.\n- [jna-posix](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jna-posix): Common POSIX Functions for Java.\n- [JNAerator](https://github.com/nativelibs4java/JNAerator): Pronounced \"generator\", auto-generates JNA mappings from C headers, by Olivier Chafik.\n- [Freedom for Media in Java](https://github.com/jitsi/fmj) by Ken Larson/Dieter Krachtus.\n- [GStreamer-Java](https://github.com/gstreamer-java/): Java bindings and utilities for [GStreamer 1.x](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/).\n- [VLCJ](https://github.com/caprica/vlcj): Java bindings for libVLC.\n- [SVNKit](http://svnkit.com): Pure Java Subversion client library.\n- [OmegaT Computer-Aided Translation](https://omegat.org/).\n- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) by JetBrains.\n- [Jetbrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) by JetBrains.\n- [Apache NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/) by Apache Software Foundation.\n- [FileBot Media Renamer](http://www.filebot.net) by Reinhard Pointner.\n- [USB for Java](https://launchpad.net/libusb4j) by Mario Boikov.\n- [Waffle](https://github.com/dblock/waffle): Enables SSO on Windows in Java applications, by Daniel Doubrovkine.\n- [leveldb-jna](https://github.com/protonail/leveldb-jna): Cross-platform JNA based adapter for [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb).\n- [bolt-jna](https://github.com/protonail/bolt-jna): Cross-platform JNA based adapter for [Bolt](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt).

See the native [Makefile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/java-native-access/jna/master/native/Makefile) for native configurations that have been built and tested.  If your platform is supported by [libffi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libffi), then chances are you can build JNA for it.\n\nPre-built platform support may be found [here](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/tree/master/lib/native).\n\nDownload\n========\n\nVersion 5.16.0\n\nJNA\n---\n\n[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/net.java.dev.jna/jna.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/net.java.dev.jna/jna/5.16.0/jar)&nbsp;[jna-5.16.0.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/dev/jna/jna/5.16.0/jna-5.16.0.jar)&nbsp;[jna-jpms-5.16.0.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/dev/jna/jna-jpms/5.16.0/jna-jpms-5.16.0.jar)\n\nThis is the core artifact of JNA and contains only the binding library and the\ncore helper classes.\n\nJNA Platform\n------------\n\n[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/net.java.dev.jna/jna-platform.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/net.java.dev.jna/jna-platform/5.16.0/jar)&nbsp;[jna-platform-5.16.0.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/dev/jna/jna-platform/5.16.0/jna-platform-5.16.0.jar)&nbsp;[jna-platform-jpms-5.16.0.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/dev/jna/jna-platform-jpms/5.16.0/jna-platform-jpms-5.16.0.jar)\n\nThis artifact holds cross-platform mappings and mappings for a number of commonly used platform\nfunctions, including a large number of Win32 mappings as well as a set of utility classes\nthat simplify native access. The code is tested and the utility interfaces ensure that\nnative memory management is taken care of correctly.\n\nSee [PlatformLibrary.md](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/master/www/PlatformLibrary.md) for details.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n* Automatic mapping from Java to native functions, with simple mappings for all primitive data types\n* Runs on most platforms which support Java\n* Automatic conversion between C and Java strings, with customizable encoding/decoding\n* Structure and Union arguments/return values, by reference and by value\n* Function Pointers, (callbacks from native code to Java) as arguments and/or members of a struct\n* Auto-generated Java proxies for native function pointers\n* By-reference (pointer-to-type) arguments\n* Java array and NIO Buffer arguments (primitive types and pointers) as pointer-to-buffer\n* Nested structures and arrays\n* Wide (wchar_t-based) strings\n* Native long support (32- or 64-bit as appropriate)\n* [Demo applications/examples](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/tree/master/contrib)\n* Supported on 1.4 or later JVMs, including JavaME (earlier VMs may work with stubbed NIO support)\n* Customizable marshalling/unmarshalling (argument and return value conversions)\n* Customizable mapping from Java method to native function name, and customizable invocation to simulate C preprocessor function macros\n* Support for automatic Windows ASCII/UNICODE function mappings\n* Varargs support\n* Type-safety for native pointers\n* VM crash protection (optional)\n* Optimized direct mapping for high-performance applications.\n* COM support for early and late binding.\n* COM/Typelib java code generator.\n\nCommunity and Support\n=====================\n\nAll questions should be posted to the [jna-users Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/jna-users).
