Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory or Azure environment.\n\nBloodHound was created by [@_wald0](https://www.twitter.com/_wald0), [@CptJesus](https://twitter.com/CptJesus), and [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y).\n\nBloodHound is maintained by the [BloodHound Enterprise](https://bloodhoundenterprise.io/) team.\n\n# About BloodHound Enterprise\n\n[BloodHound Enterprise](https://bloodhoundenterprise.io/) is an Attack Path Management solution that continuously maps and quantifies Active Directory Attack Paths. You can remove millions, even billions of Attack Paths within your existing architecture and eliminate the attacker\u2019s easiest, most reliable, and most attractive techniques.\n\n# Downloading BloodHound Binaries\nPre-Compiled BloodHound binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/releases). \n\nThe rolling release will always be updated to the most recent source. Tagged releases are considered \"stable\" but will likely not have new features or fixes.\n\n# Creating example data\n\nA sample database generator can be found [here](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound-Tools/tree/master/DBCreator)\n\nYou can create your own example Active Directory environment using [BadBlood](https://github.com/davidprowe/BadBlood).\n\n# License\n\nBloodHound uses graph theory to reveal hidden relationships and\nattack paths in an Active Directory environment.\nCopyright (C) 2016-2023 Specter Ops Inc.\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
