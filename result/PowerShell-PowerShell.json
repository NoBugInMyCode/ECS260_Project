For\nmore information, see [Installing PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell).\n\n## Upgrading PowerShell\n\nFor best results when upgrading, you should use the same install method you used when you first\ninstalled PowerShell. The update method is different for each platform and install method.\n\n## Community Dashboard\n\n[Dashboard](https://aka.ms/PSPublicDashboard) with visualizations for community contributions and project status using PowerShell, Azure, and PowerBI.\n\nFor more information on how and why we built this dashboard, check out this [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-open-source-community-dashboard/).\n\n## Discussions\n\n[GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/discussions/quickstart) is a feature to enable free and open discussions within the community\nfor topics that are not related to code, unlike issues.\n\nThis is an experiment we are trying in our repositories, to see if it helps move discussions out of issues so that issues remain actionable by the team or members of the community.\nThere should be no expectation that PowerShell team members are regular participants in these discussions.\nIndividual PowerShell team members may choose to participate in discussions, but the expectation is that community members help drive discussions so that team members\ncan focus on issues.\n\nCreate or join a [discussion](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/discussions).\n\n## Chat\n\nWant to chat with other members of the PowerShell community?\n\nThere are dozens of topic-specific channels on our community-driven PowerShell Virtual User Group, which you can join on:\n\n* [Gitter](https://gitter.im/PowerShell/PowerShell)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/PowerShell)\n* [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/#powershell) on Libera.Chat\n* [Slack](https://aka.ms/psslack)\n\n## Building the Repository\n\n| Linux                    |
