The stack is made up of:\n\n- **M**ongoDB : Document database \u2013 used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents\n- **E**xpress (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js\n- **A**ngular (formerly Angular.js): Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic\n- **N**ode.js : JavaScript runtime environment \u2013 lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\n- git - [Installation guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/) .\n- node.js - [Download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) .\n- npm - comes with node or download yarn - [Download page](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) .\n- mongodb - [Download page](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) .\n\n### Installation\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/linnovate/mean\ncd mean\ncp .env.example .env\nyarn\nyarn start (for development)\n```\n\n### Docker based\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Make sure your Docker version is 19.03.0+.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/linnovate/mean\ncd mean\ncp .env.example .env\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n### Credits\n\n- The MEAN name was coined by Valeri Karpov.\n- Initial concept and development were done by Amos Haviv and sponsored by Linnovate.\n- Inspired by the great work of Madhusudhan Srinivasa.\n",
