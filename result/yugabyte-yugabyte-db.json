It combines the benefits of traditional relational databases with the scalability of NoSQL systems, making it suitable for applications that require both transactional consistency and the ability to handle large amounts of data. It is best suited for cloud-native OLTP (that is, real-time, business-critical) applications that need absolute data correctness and require at least one of the following: scalability, high tolerance to failures, or globally-distributed deployments.\n\n* [Core Features](#core-features)\n* [Get Started](#get-started)\n* [Build Apps](#build-apps)\n* [Current Roadmap](#current-roadmap)\n* [Recent features](#recently-released-features)\n* [Architecture](#architecture)\n* [Need Help?](#need-help)\n* [Contribute](#contribute)\n* [License](#license)\n* [Read More](#read-more)\n\n# Core Features\n\n* **[Powerful RDBMS capabilities](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/ysql-language-features/)** Yugabyte SQL (*YSQL* for short) reuses the PostgreSQL query layer (similar to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL), thereby supporting most of its features (datatypes, queries, expressions, operators and functions, stored procedures, triggers, extensions, and so on).\n\n* **[Distributed transactions](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/architecture/transactions/)** The transaction design is based on the Google Spanner architecture. Strong consistency of writes is achieved by using Raft consensus for replication and cluster-wide distributed ACID transactions using *hybrid logical clocks*. *Snapshot*, *serializable* and *read committed* isolation levels are supported. Reads (queries) have strong consistency by default, but can be tuned dynamically to read from followers and read replicas.\n\n* **[Continuous availability](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/fault-tolerance/)** YugabyteDB is extremely resilient to common outages with native failover and repair. YugabyteDB can be configured to tolerate disk, rack, node, zone, region, and cloud failures automatically. For a typical deployment where a YugabyteDB cluster is deployed in one region across multiple zones on a public cloud, the RPO is 0 (meaning no data is lost on failure) and the RTO is 3 seconds (meaning the data being served by the failed node is available in 3 seconds).\n\n* **[Horizontal scalability](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/linear-scalability/)** Scaling a YugabyteDB cluster to achieve more IOPS or data storage is as simple as adding nodes to the cluster.\n\n* **[Geo-distributed, multi-cloud](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/develop/multi-cloud/)** YugabyteDB can be deployed in public clouds and natively inside Kubernetes. It supports deployments that span three or more fault domains, such as multi-zone, multi-rack, multi-region, and multi-cloud deployments. It also supports xCluster asynchronous replication with unidirectional master-slave and bidirectional multi-master configurations in two-region deployments. Read replicas are also a supported to serve (stale) data with low latencies.\n\n* **[Multi API design](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/api)** The YugabyteDB query layer is built to be extensible. Currently, YugabyteDB supports two distributed SQL APIs: [Yugabyte SQL (YSQL)](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/api/ysql/), a fully relational API that re-uses the PostgreSQL query layer, and [Yugabyte Cloud QL (YCQL)](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/api/ycql/), a semi-relational SQL-like API with documents/indexing support with Apache Cassandra QL roots.\n\n* **[100% open source](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db)** YugabyteDB is fully open-source under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/LICENSE.md). The open-source version has powerful enterprise features such as distributed backups, encryption of data at rest, in-flight TLS encryption, change data capture, read replicas, and more.\n\nYugabyteDB was created with several key design goals in mind, aiming to address the challenges faced by modern, cloud-native applications while maintaining the familiarity and power of traditional relational databases. Read more about these in our [Design goals](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/architecture/design-goals/).\n\n# Get Started\n\n* [Quick Start](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/quick-start/)\n* Try running a real-world demo application:\n  * [Microservices-oriented e-commerce app](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugastore-java)\n  * [Streaming IoT app with Kafka and Spark Streaming](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/develop/realworld-apps/iot-spark-kafka-ksql/)\n\nCan't find what you're looking for?

This includes features under active development and is recommended for development and testing only. For the full list of features and improvements in this release, see [Release notes - v2.25](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/releases/ybdb-releases/v2.25/). Here are some of the prominent features.\n\n### [PostgreSQL 15 Support](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/develop/pg15-features/)\n\nAs part of this release, we have upgraded our PostgreSQL fork from version 11.2 to 15.0, enabling you to leverage the many key capabilities introduced in PostgreSQL between these two versions. This upgrade brings YSQL API support for numerous features, including stored generated columns, foreign keys on partitioned tables, and non-distinct NULLs in unique indexes. It also introduces query execution optimizations like incremental sort and memoization, along with various observability and security enhancements.\n\n### [Query Diagnostics](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/query-1-performance/query-diagnostics/)\n\nThis feature significantly simplifies tuning poorly performing SQL queries by allowing you to capture and export detailed diagnostic information, including bind variables and constants, pg_stat_statements statistics, schema details, active session history, and execution plans.\n\n### [Active session history](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/observability/active-session-history/)\n\nIn addition, the Active Session History, which provides real-time and historical views of system activity, is now enabled by default.\n\n## v2024.2 (Stable) - Dec, 2024\n\n**v2024.2** is the current [stable](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/releases/versioning/#stable-releases) release. Stable releases undergo rigorous testing for a longer period of time and are ready for production use. For the full list of features and improvements in this release, see [Release notes - v2024.2](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/releases/ybdb-releases/v2024.2/). Here are some of the prominent features.\n\n#### [Yugabyte Kubernetes Operator](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/quick-start/kubernetes/#yugabytedb-kubernetes-operator)\n\nThe [Yugabyte Kubernetes Operator](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/quick-start/kubernetes/#yugabytedb-kubernetes-operator) is a powerful tool designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing YugabyteDB clusters in Kubernetes environments. It streamlines database operations, reducing manual effort for developers and operators. For more information, refer to the [YugabyteDB Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-k8s-operator) GitHub project.\n\n#### [Active session history](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/explore/observability/active-session-history/)\n\nGet real-time and historical views of system activity by sampling session activity in the database. Use this feature to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues.\n\n#### [pg_partman extension](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgpartman/)\n\nUse the [pg_partman extension](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgpartman/) to create and manage both time- and serial-based (aka range-based) table partition sets. pg_partman is often used in combination with [pg_cron](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgcron/) for data lifecycle management, and specifically for managing data aging, retention, and expiration.\n\n#### [Colocated tables with tablespaces](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/explore/colocation/#colocated-tables-with-tablespaces)\n\nStarting this release, you can create [colocated tables with tablespaces](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/explore/colocation/#colocated-tables-with-tablespaces). With this enhancement, you can now take advantage of colocated tables for geo-distributed use cases, eliminating the need for trade-offs between distributing data across specific regions.\n\n# Architecture\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/master/architecture/images/yb-architecture.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"YugabyteDB Architecture\"/>\n\nReview detailed architecture in our [Docs](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/architecture/).\n\n# Need Help?\n\n* You can ask questions, find answers, and help others on our Community [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/yugabyte-db/register), [Forum](https://forum.yugabyte.com), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/yugabyte-db), as well as Twitter [@Yugabyte](https://twitter.com/yugabyte).\n\n* Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues) to report issues or request new features.\n\n* To troubleshoot YugabyteDB and cluster/node-level issues, refer to [Troubleshooting documentation](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/troubleshoot/).\n\n# Contribute\n\nAs an open-source project with a strong focus on the user community, we welcome contributions as GitHub pull requests.
