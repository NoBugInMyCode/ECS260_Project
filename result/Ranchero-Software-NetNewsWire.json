Spoiler: don\u2019t send money. :)\n\n#### Community\n\n[Join the Slack group](https://netnewswire.com/slack) to talk with other NetNewsWire users \u2014\u00a0and to help out, if you\u2019d like to, by testing, coding, writing, providing feedback, or just helping us think things through. Everybody is welcome and encouraged to join.\n\nEvery community member is expected to abide by the [code of conduct](CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct) which is included in the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n#### Pull Requests\n\nSee the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page for our process. It\u2019s pretty straightforward.\n\n#### Building\n\nYou can build and test NetNewsWire without a paid developer account.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire.git\n```\n\nYou can locally override the Xcode settings for code signing\nby creating a `DeveloperSettings.xcconfig` file locally at the appropriate path.\nThis allows for a pristine project with code signing set up with the appropriate\ndeveloper ID and certificates, and for developer to be able to have local settings\nwithout needing to check in anything into source control.\n\nYou can do this in one of two ways: using the included `setup.sh` script or by creating the folder structure and file manually.\n\n##### Using `setup.sh`\n\n- Open Terminal and `cd` into the NetNewsWire directory. \n- Run this command to ensure you have execution rights for the script: `chmod +x setup.sh`\n- Execute the script with the following command: `./setup.sh` and complete the answers.\n\n##### Manually \n\nMake a directory `SharedXcodeSettings` next to where you have this repository.\n\nThe directory structure is:\n\n```\naDirectory/\n  SharedXcodeSettings/\n    DeveloperSettings.xcconfig\n  NetNewsWire/\n    NetNewsWire.xcworkspace\n```\nExample:\n\nIf your NetNewsWire Xcode project file is at:\n`/Users/Shared/git/NetNewsWire/NetNewsWire.xcodeproj`\n\nCreate your `DeveloperSettings.xcconfig` file at\n`/Users/Shared/git/SharedXcodeSettings/DeveloperSettings.xcconfig`\n\nThen create a plain text file in it: `SharedXcodeSettings/DeveloperSettings.xcconfig` and\ngive it the contents:\n\n```\nCODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = Mac Developer\nDEVELOPMENT_TEAM = <Your Team ID>\nCODE_SIGN_STYLE = Automatic\nORGANIZATION_IDENTIFIER = <Your Domain Name Reversed>\nDEVELOPER_ENTITLEMENTS = -dev\nPROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER =\n```\n\nSet `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` to your Apple supplied development team.  You can use Keychain\nAccess to [find your development team ID](/Technotes/FindingYourDevelopmentTeamID.md).\nSet `ORGANIZATION_IDENTIFIER` to a reversed domain name that you control or have made up.\nNote that `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER` should not have a value associated with it.\n\nYou can now open the `NetNewsWire.xccodeproj` in Xcode.\n\nNow you should be able to build without code signing errors and without modifying\nthe NetNewsWire Xcode project.  This is a special build of NetNewsWire with some\nfunctionality disabled.  This is because we have API keys that can't be stored in the\nrepository or shared between developers.  Certain account types, like Feedly, aren't\nenabled and the Reader View isn't enabled because of this.\n\nIf you have any problems, we will help you out in Slack ([see above](README.md#Community)).\n",
