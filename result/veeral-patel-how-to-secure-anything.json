[my notes](anderson/anderson-ch1.md)\n- [What's the problem?

If humans already know how to secure something well, why try to derive the answer ourselves?\n- Learn about the adversaries you want to defend against\n- We write down our security policies, or high level security goals\n- We develop a security model, or a spec we follow to satisfy our policies\n- We reduce attack surface, follow security design principles, brainstorm ideas for and implement additonal security controls, and more -- to improve our security\n- We test our design by assessing our controls, assessing protocols, looking for side channels, and more\n- We write assurance cases to prove we satisfy our security policy.\n\n## Follow known best practices\n\nBefore anything else, I'd Google for the best practices for securing whatever you're trying to secure and implement all of them.\n\nIf you're in a corporate environment, set up SSO and 2FA. If you're securing a physical facility, see if there's a well-regarded physical security standard you can comply with.\n\nI'd study how people have defended what you're defending now in the past. Also, I'd talk to the people who are the very best at defending what I'm defending now, and learn what they do that most people don't do.\n\nDoing this will make you significantly more secure than the majority of people, who don't do this.\n\n## Understand your adversaries\n\nThere's no such thing as a system being secure, only being secure against a particular adversary.\n\nThis is why it's important to understand who your adversaries are, as well as the motivation behind\nand capabilities of each adversary.\n\nConsider non-human threats, too. If you're asked to secure a painting in a museum, a fire may technically not be a security issue -- but it's something to guard against, regardless.\n\nAlso, study the history of attacks. If I was designing a prison, I'd learn about all the past prison breakouts that I could.\n\n- [Agile threat modeling](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-threat-modelling.html) - [my notes](threat_modeling/agile-threat-modeling.md)\n- [Threat Modeling: Designing for Security](https://www.amazon.com/Threat-Modeling-Designing-Adam-Shostack/dp/1118809998)\n- [Awesome Threat Modeling](https://github.com/hysnsec/awesome-threat-modelling)\n- [Some thoughts on threat modeling](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/threat_modelling.pdf)\n- [Threat modeling: 12 available methods](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2018/12/threat-modeling-12-available-methods.html)\n- [Approachable threat modeling](https://increment.com/security/approachable-threat-modeling/)\n- [OWASP Threat Model Cookbook](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-model-cookbook)\n- [Threat modeling for dummies](https://www.slideshare.net/AdamEnglander/threat-modeling-for-dummies-cascadia-php-2018)\n- [Threat modeling cheatsheet (from OWASP)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [A Guide to Understanding Security Modeling in Trusted Systems](https://fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/tg010.pdf)\n- [Adversaries: Know Thy Opponent (from Saydjari's book)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/engineering-trustworthy-systems/9781260118186/ch6.xhtml#ch6)\n- [\"Who is your opponent?\" (from Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch2-dec18.pdf)\n\n## Security policies\n\nPolicies are the high level properties we want our system to have. Policies are what we want to happen.\n\nLet's say we're designing a prison.\n\nI'd start with a strong policy:\n\n> No prisoner may escape the prison.\n\nOf course, time, money, and manpower are all limited. The goal isn't to eliminate risk entirely,\nbut bring it down to an acceptable level.\n\nAs I go through the next couple steps and learn what controls I need and how costly they'll be, I might refine my security policy to something like this:\n\n> No more than 10 out of 10,000 (0.1%) prisoners may escape our prison in any given time period.\n\n[Looking at benchmarks](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.2782&rep=rep1&type=pdf) may help us come up with this number.\n\nAny system has additional requirements in addition to its security requirements. These two sets of requirements may conflict, so you may need to relax your security requirements.\n\nGoing back to the example above, our policy is that only a tiny percentage of prisoners may leave the prison without permission. But what if there's a fire?\n\nIf you've achieved this low escape rate by building a fully autonomous fortress with no fire detection or human override, the results may be suboptimal.\n\n## Security models\n\nWe can then turn our policy into a more detailed model. A model is a set of rules, a specification, we can follow to achieve our policy. Our policy is our \"what\", the model is our \"how\".\n\n> Each individual in the prison facility must have a ID that identifies him/her as a \"prisoner\" or \"not a prisoner\"\n\n> A prisoner may have the written consent of the warden to leave.\n\n> A non-prisoner may leave at any time.\n\n- [Computer Security: Art and Science](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Security-Art-Science-Set/dp/013428951X) covers this topic very well\n- [Flask security architecture](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/flask-usenixsec99.pdf)\n- [Sancus 2.0: A Low-Cost Security Architecture for IoT Devices](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/publications/article-2785.pdf)\n\nLuckily, in information security, our policies often revolve around confidentiality, integrity, and availability and so there are popular existing security models for each of these policies.\n\nFor confidentiality, for example, you can choose between:\n\n- [multilevel security](#multilevel), for which [Bell-Padula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%E2%80%93LaPadula_model) can be used\n- [multilateral security](#multilateral), for which compartmentation, BMA, [Chinese wall](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alinush/6.858-fall-2014/papers/chinese-wall-sec-pol.pdf) can be used (according to Anderson's book)\n\nSee also [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security_model) and [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_security_models) on computer models.\n\n## Improve defenses\n\nHere are some useful techniques I've found for improving the security of a system.\n\nAlso see if you any of the mechanisms in [popular mechanisms](#popular-mechanisms) would help.\n\n### Minimize attack surface\n\nSee tptacek's [HN comment on this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17014818):\n\n> For instance: you can set up fail2ban, sure. But what's it doing for you? If you have password SSH authentication enabled anywhere, you're already playing to lose, and logging and reactive blocking isn't really going to help you. Don't scan your logs for this problem; scan your configurations and make sure the brute-force attack simply can't work.\n\n> The same goes for most of the stuff shrink-wrap tools look for in web logs. OSSEC isn't bad, but the things you're going to light up on with OSSEC out of the box all mean something went so wrong that you got owned up.\n\n> Same with URL regexes. You can set up log detection for people hitting your admin interfaces. But then you have to ask: why is your admin interface available on routable IPs to begin with?\n\n- [OWASP Attack Surface Analysis Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- See the papers in [this folder](attack_surface)\n\n### Minimize and verify your trusted computing base (TCB)\n\nWhen evaluating a design, it's useful to see how much of the system must be trusted in order for a security goal\nto be achieved. The smaller this trusted computing base is, the better.\n\nAlso, once you identify the TCB for an existing system, you know that you only need to secure your TCB. You don't\nneed to worry about securing components outside your TCB.\n\nYou want to make your TCB as small, simple, unbypassable, tamper-resistant, and verifiable as you can, as I\nwrite about [here](https://github.com/veeral-patel/learn-security-engineering/blob/master/ucb-tcb-notes.md#remember).\n\n- [OS Security Concepts (from CS 161 from UC Berkeley)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs161/fa16/slides/lec4.pdf)\n- [Design patterns for building secure systems](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs161/fa16/notes/1.27.patterns.pdf) - [my notes](ucb-tcb-notes.md)\n- [TSAFE: Building a Trusted Computing Base forAir Traffic Control Software](tcbs/tsafe.pdf)\n- [Ten page intro to trusted computing](tcbs/ten_page_intro_to_trusted_computing.pdf)\n- [Reducing TCB Complexity for Security-Sensitive Applications: Three Case Studies](http://141.76.48.99/papers_ps/eurosys2006.pdf)\n- [The Nizza Secure-System Architecture](https://genode-labs.com/publications/nizza-2005.pdf)\n\n### Separate privileges\n\nWhen designing a system, a great way to mitigate the impact of a successful attack is to break the system\ndown into components based upon their privilege level.\n\nThen, ask what's the least amount of privilege each component needs -- and then enforce the allowed privileges with a [sandbox](https://github.com/veeral-patel/learn-security-engineering#sandboxing) (if applicable).\n\nSay one of our SRE SSH's into a production EC2 instance as `root` to check the instance's memory and CPU usage. Instead, we can assign the SRE a non-root account. Even better, we can whitelist the commands this account can run.\nEven better, we can even remove SSH access entirely and set up [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for monitoring.\n\n- [Lecture 4: Privilege Separation (6.858 from MIT)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/video-lectures/lecture-4-privilege-separation/) - [my notes](mit-6858-lec-4-privilege-separation.md)\n- [SSH daemon (from Niels Provos)](http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html)\n- [OKWS paper](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/okws-usenix04.pdf)\n- [Security architecture of the Chromium browser](http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/chromium/chromium-security-architecture.pdf)\n- [Nested Kernel: An Operating System Architecture for Intra-Kernel Privilege Separation](https://nathandautenhahn.com/downloads/publications/asplos200-dautenhahn.pdf)\n- [Privilege bracketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_bracketing) - see also [this page](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19109-01/tsolaris8/816-1042/6m7g4ma52/index.html)\n- [Exploit mitigation techniques in OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/papers/v)\n- [Privtrans: Automatically Partitioning Programs for Privilege Separation](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec04/tech/full_papers/brumley/brumley_html/)\n\n### Minimize privileges\n\n- [Ways to minimize privileges](https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/minimize-privileges.html)\n- [Make least privilege a right (not a privilege)](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/home/papers/krohn:least-privilege.pdf)\n- [Plash: tools for least privilege](http://www.plash.beasts.org/index.html)\n- [SHILL: A Secure Shell Scripting Language](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-moore.pdf)\n- [Security wrappers and Bernstein chaining](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch06s06.html)\n\n### Secure by default\n\n- [Weakest link security](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/12/weakest_link_se.html) - ignore the title!\n- [Secure by default \u2013 the case of TLS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07569.pdf)\n- [Configure Safely and Use Safe Defaults](https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/safe-configure.html)\n\n### Secure by design\n\n- [Stop trying to fix the user](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/10/security_design.html)\n\n### Prevent/detect/respond framework\n\nThe way I see it, every defense falls into one of these categories:\n\n- Prevent: consists of deter, stop\n- Detect\n- Respond: consists of delay, contain, investigate, remediate\n\nTake any attack. Then, for each of the seven categories, brainstorm defenses that fall into that category.\n\n### Kill chains\n\nBy mapping out an adversary's kill chain, we can then identify controls to counteract\neach step in the kill chain.

The idea is to perform a check on every request. If you cache results, then a request that should be rejected after things changed might be allowed. [See this link](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/complete-mediation)\n- Work factor - find ways to make the attacker need to do several times more work to break something than it takes you, the defender. [Here's a paper](https://www.nspw.org/papers/2000/nspw2000-schudel.pdf) on dynamic network reconfiguration being used to increase recon work for attackers\n- Security is economics - discussed [later in the repo](#economics)\n- Human factors matter - if a control relies on a human to do something, make sure your control is usable or the person just won't do it\n- Know your threat model & update it - keep your threat model up to date with threats, and your defenses too\n- Trust only trustworthy channels - see [this article](https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/trustworthy-channels.html)\n- Set up a trusted path - see [this article](https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/trusted-path.html)\n- Set up a central chokepoint for access control and logging (see also reference monitor)\n\nSources\n\n- [Stop buying bad security prescriptions](https://medium.com/@justin.schuh/stop-buying-bad-security-prescriptions-f18e4f61ba9e)\n- [Design principles (from US CERT)](https://www.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/design-principles)\n- [Principles for building secure systems](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs161/sp19/notes/Principles.1.19.pdf)\n- [More principles](https://tramnguyenio.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/design-principles.pdf)\n- [Even more principles (from David Wagner)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/teaching/cs261-f07/slides-aug30.pdf)\n- [The Information Security Practice Principles](https://cacr.iu.edu/principles/ISPP-Foundational-Whitepaper-2017.pdf)\n\n## Find vulnerabilities\n\nThe techniques below help you find vulnerabilities in a proposed design for you to fix.\n\n### Developing an attacker mindset\n\n> Theories of security derive from theories of insecurity. - Unknown\n\n> If you're a great attacker you can be \"logically\" a great defender. However, a great defender cannot be a great attacker, nor would I say they could be a \"great\" defender. - [Caleb Sima](https://twitter.com/csima), VP of Security at Databricks\n\n> Any person can invent a security system so clever that she or he can't think of how to break it - [Schneier's Law](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html)\n\nMore important than the attacks in subsequent sections is being able to think creatively, like an attacker. I do believe this skill is essential if you want in order to assess the security of your designs effectively.\n\nThis section describes some techniques for developing this skill that I've gathered.\n\n#### Think in graphs\n\nRead [this post by John Lambert first](https://github.com/JohnLaTwC/Shared/blob/master/Defenders%20think%20in%20lists.%20Attackers%20think%20in%20graphs.%20As%20long%20as%20this%20is%20true%2C%20attackers%20win.md). It's about how attackers think in graphs, while defenders think in lists, so attackers win.\n\nI've copied the list of links below from John's post above.\n\n- [Heat-ray: Combating Identity Snowball Attacks Using Machine Learning, Combinatorial Optimization and Attack Graph](http://alicezheng.org/papers/sosp2009-heatray-10pt.pdf)\n- [Two Formal Analyses of Attack Graphs](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scenariograph/jha-wing.pdf)\n- [Using Model Checking to Analyze Network Vulnerabilities](http://cyberunited.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Using-Model-Checking-to-Analyze-Network-Vulnerabilities.pdf)\n- [A Graph-Based System for Network-Vulnerability Analysis](http://web2.utc.edu/~djy471/CPSC4660/graph-vulnerability.pdf)\n- [Automated Generation and Analysis of Attack Graphs](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scenariograph/sheyner-wing02.pdf)\n- [Modern Intrusion Practices](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-03/bh-us-03-richarte.pdf)\n- [Attack Planning in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4044.pdf)\n\n### Attack trees\n\nAfter building an attack tree, you can query it easily: \"list all the attack paths costing\nless than \\$100k\". (Remember: we don't seek absolute security, but rather security against\na certain set of adversaries.)\n\nAlso, remember the [weakest link principle](https://www.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/securing-the-weakest-link). You can query your attack tree for the lowest cost attack\npath and ensure that the cost isn't too low.\n\n- [Attack trees (from Bruce Schneier)](https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1999/12/attack_trees.html)\n\n### On, un-bypassable, tamperproof, functionally correct, fail closed\n\nIf a security control does not have the qualities above, then an attacker can violate a system's security properties by subverting its controls.\n\n- Can the attacker turn off the control?\n- Can the attacker get you to turn off the control?\n- Can the attacker get around your control?\n- Does the control depend on something that the attacker can disable?\n- Are there any cases where the control doesn't work?\n- Does the control fail open or closed? If it fails open, can the attacker make the control fail?\n\n#### Example: a burglar\n\nTake a burglar confronting a home security system which calls the police if someone crosses the lawn at night\n\n- Can the burglar turn off the control? Probably not\n- Can the burglar get you to turn off the control? Yes, they could set off the alarm everyday until you turn it off\n- Can the burglar get around your control? Yes, they could land on the roof\n- Does the control depend on something that the burglar can disable? Yes, the burglar can cut the electric wire or the fiber cable used to call the police\n- Are there any cases where the control doesn't work? The burglar can buy the control and learn the alarm doesn't go off if they tip toes.\n\n### Assumptions analysis\n\nI like using a statement/conclusion format to draw out my assumptions about my controls.\n\nStatement: I have a home security system which calls the police if someone crosses the lawn.\n\nConclusion: I won't get robbed.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- For every single attacker that tries to cross my lawn, my home security system calls the police. (If the answer to any of the questions above is yes, this assumption is false.)\n- The police will arrive before any attacker is able to steal anything and stop the theft.\n  - What if the attacker impersonates the homeowner and tells the police that my home security system is faulty; don't come if it calls you?\n  - What if the attacker makes hundreds of 911 calls while they are robbing the house?\n  - What if the police is blocked by a \"car accident\"? What if the attacker has arranged for a getaway helicopter?\n\nSaydjari writes an entire chapter on this:\n\n- [Architecting cybersecurity (from Saydjari's book)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/engineering-trustworthy-systems/9781260118186/ch20.xhtml) - [my notes](saydjari/saydjari-ch20.md)\n\n### Failure analysis\n\nWe want our security controls to fail closed, not open. There's two ways to analyze the ways something\nmight fail: failure tree analysis (FTA), which is top down, and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA),\nwhich is bottom up.\n\n- [How to avoid failures](https://www.dsiintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/HOW-TO-AVOID-FAILURES-FMEA-andor-FTA.pdf)\n- [Hazard Analysis Techniques for System Safety](https://www.amazon.com/Hazard-Analysis-Techniques-System-Safety/dp/0471720194)\n- [Intro to Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)](http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Systems-Theoretic-Process-Analysis-STPA-John-Thomas.pdf)\n\n#### Fault tree analysis\n\n- [Intro to fault trees](https://www.weibull.com/basics/fault-tree/index.htm)\n\n#### FMEA\n\n- [FMEA Procedure](https://asq.org/quality-resources/fmea)\n- [FMEA: From Theory to Execution](https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Mode-Effect-Analysis-Execution/dp/0873895983)\n- [The Basics of FMEA](https://www.amazon.com/Basics-FMEA-Raymond-J-Mikulak/dp/1563273772)\n\n### Protocol analysis\n\nProtocols aren't a tool for securing something. But all communication between two components of a system is done through\na protocol, so it's worth learning how to analyze protocols for vulnerabilities.\n\n- [\"Protocols\" (from Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch4-dec18.pdf)\n- [A logic of authentication](protocols/a_logic_of_authentication.pdf)\n- [Programming Satan's computer](protocols/programming_satans_computer.pdf)\n- [Using Encryption for Authentication in Large Networks of Computers](protocols/using_encryption_for_authentication_in_large_networks_of_computers.pdf)\n- [Three systems for cryptographic protocol analysis](protocols/three_systems_for_cryptographic_protocol_analysis.pdf)\n\n### Side channel analysis\n\nEven if something isn't vulnerable to attacks (on confidentiality, integrity, or\navailability), it may leak information which makes these attacks easier.\n\nFor example, take a login program that checks if the username is valid, returns\na generic \"login failed\" error if it's not, then checks if the password is valid,\nand returns the same generic error if it's not.\n\nAt a first glance, determining if a particular username is valid may seem\nimpossible. After all, the error message is the same regardless of whether the\nusername is invalid or the username is valid and the password is invalid.\n\nHowever, an attacker could examine the time it takes to get the error to\ndetermine if the username is valid or not.\n\n- [\"Side channels\" (from Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch19-dec18.pdf)\n- [Covert vs overt vs side channels](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/113332/covert-overt-and-side-channels) - See this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4083860/in-computer-security-what-are-covert-and-side-channels) too\n- [A Guide to Understanding Covert Channel Analysis of Trusted Systems](https://fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/tg030.htm#2.0)\n- [List of ways to find side channels in hardware/software](https://pastebin.com/ajqxDJ3J)\n\n## Assurance\n\nThe goal of security engineering is to build a system that satisfies certain security properties -- not just to add a lot of controls.\nAssurance is how we prove that our system satisfies the properties we want it to.\n\n- [Assuring cybersecurity: getting it right (from Saydjari's book)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/engineering-trustworthy-systems/9781260118186/ch21.xhtml#ch21)\n- [Notes on high-assurance security methods by nickpsecurity](https://gist.github.com/ryazo/3267bcd5aedeebb9224ad90183a5eb85) - see also his writeup on [software distribution](https://pastebin.com/EZQWbwCB)\n- [Guidelines for Formal Verification Systems](https://fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/tg014.htm)\n- [Constructing a high assurance mail guard](https://cryptosmith.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/mailguard.pdf)\n- [Designing The Gemsos Security Kernel For Security And Performance](http://mrheckman.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/DesigningTheGemsosSecurityKernel-OCR-120409-DRAFT.158131458.pdf)\n- [SIFT: Design and Analysis of a Fault-Tolerant Computer for Aircraft Control](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Design-and-Analysis-of-a-Fault-Tolerant-Computer-for-Aircraft-Control.pdf)\n- [Design and Verification of Secure Systems](http://www.csl.sri.com/users/rushby/papers/sosp81.pdf)\n- [Commercial Product Evaluations](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/1347159/FID1930/INDEX.HTML)\n- [Make computers keep secrets](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/33481/24370594-MIT.pdf)\n- [Hints for High-Assurance Cyber-Physical System Design](https://leepike.github.io/pubs/pike-secdev16.pdf)\n- [High-Assurance Separation Kernels: A Survey on Formal Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01535.pdf)\n- [Separation Virtual Machine Monitors](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.363.3314&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=435)\n- [The Cross Domain Desktop Compositor: Using hardware-based video compositing for a multi-level secure user interface](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/papers/cddc-acsac2016.pdf)\n- [CH26 Managing the Development of Secure Systems (from Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch26-jul24.pdf)\n- [CH27 Assurance & Sustainability (from Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch27-jul24.pdf)\n- [We need assurance!](https://www.acsac.org/2005/papers/Snow.pdf)\n- [The Orange Book](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/conference-paper/1998/10/08/proceedings-of-the-21st-nissc-1998/documents/early-cs-papers/dod85.pdf)\n- [Public Pentesting Reports](https://github.com/juliocesarfort/public-pentesting-reports)\n- [High-Assurance Smart Card Operating System for Electronic Visas](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-msteiner/secure-token.IBM%20ICAO%20RFI%20os%2005182005pak%20.pdf)\n- [A Touch of Evil: High-Assurance Cryptographic Hardware from Untrusted Components](https://acmccs.github.io/papers/p1583-mavroudisA.pdf)\n- [Lessons learned from building a high assurance crypto gateway](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a570736.pdf)\n- [Formal Specification and Verification of a Microkernel](http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~danielwang/Investigation/Formal_Verification/JD10.pdf)\n- [Final evaluation report of SCOMP](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a229523.pdf)\n- See the papers in [this folder](assurance)\n\n## Popular mechanisms\n\nIn order to secure something, you need to know what tools are available to you. Here are some that which can be used in many different contexts.\n\nA lot of tools are context-specific, however. Before I start trying to secure a building, for example, I'd spend the time to learn about all the tools I can use: walls, sensors, natural barriers, guards, CCTV cameras, etc\n\n### Cryptography\n\n- [Cryptography: A Sharp and Fragile Tool (from Saydjari's book)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/engineering-trustworthy-systems/9781260118186/ch10.xhtml#ch10)\n- [Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms and Source Code in C](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Cryptography-Protocols-Algorithms-Source-dp-1119096723/dp/1119096723)\n- [\"Cryptography Engineering\" book](https://www.amazon.com/Cryptography-Engineering-Principles-Practical-Applications-ebook/dp/B004NSW9JU/ref=sr_1_1?crid=WBP1JC682B4V&dchild=1&keywords=cryptography+engineering&qid=1586149852&s=books&sprefix=cryptography+eng%2Cstripbooks%2C-1&sr=1-1)\n- [\"Cryptography\" (from Ross Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch5-dec18.pdf)\n- [\"Advanced Cryptographic Engineering\" (from Ross Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch20-mar17.pdf)\n- [Don't trust the math (Bruce Schneier)](https://pastebin.com/zz7YZZUk)\n\n### Economics\n\nThe idea here is to make it economically, not technically, infeasible for the attacker to attack us. He can still attack us, but his expected effort will exceed his expected gain.\n\nSay a scammer manages to scam one of every hundred people out of $5. If we can add a $0.10 fee to every call, then they'd need to pay $10 in fees to earn $5.\n\nAnother example would be not storing credit card data ourselves, and instead outsourcing this to a payment processor, so the reward of attacking us is less.\n\nIf the attacker isn't motivated by money, this doesn't work.\n\n- [\"Economics\" (from Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch8-dec18.pdf)\n- [Security Economics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/video-lectures/lecture-23-security-economics/) - here's the [transcript](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/video-lectures/lecture-23-security-economics/8PdnOZI7H5E.pdf)\n\n### Laws and regulations (deterrence by the government)\n\nDeterrence has three parts: certainty, severity, and swiftness. In other words, to deter attackers most effectively, someone should be able to catch most\nor all of them -- and do this quickly -- and then sufficiently punish them once you do catch them.\n\nThis someone could be the government, via laws and regulations against whatever you're trying to defend against. The government may not catch everyone,\nbut these laws and regulations will deter most people. Copyright protection, anti-shoplifting, and anti-trespassing laws all are examples of this.\n\n### Retaliation (deterrence by you or third parties)\n\nThe government is not the only third party who can deter attacks on you. Organizations, like NATO, can as well.\n\nAlternatively, you can try to retaliate against attacks yourself. Take, for example, media companies that sue people that pirate their movies.\n\n- [Deterrence and adversarial risk (from Saydjari's book)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/Engineering+Trustworthy+Systems:+Get+Cybersecurity+Design+Right+the+First+Time/9781260118186/ch16.xhtml#ch16lev1) - [my notes](saydjari/saydjari-ch16.md)\n\n### Tamper resistance\n\n- [\"Physical tamper resistance\" (from Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch18-dec18.pdf)\n- [Cryptographic processors \u2013 a survey](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-641.pdf)\n- [Smartcard Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Card-Handbook-Wolfgang-Rankl/dp/0470743670)\n- [Tamper Resistance - a Cautionary Note](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/tamper.html)\n- [Low Cost Attacks on Tamper Resistant Devices](http://web.cse.msstate.edu/~ramkumar/tamper2.pdf)\n- [Design Principles for Tamper-Resistant Smartcard Processors](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/sc99-tamper.pdf)\n\n### Tamper detection\n\nIf we can't prevent tampering, we can try to make it obvious when something has been tampered with.\n\nThis is one reason why bags of chips or gallons of milk, for example, are sealed.\n\n- [Optical Document Security](https://www.amazon.com/Optical-Document-Security-Rudolf-Renesse/dp/1580532586/)\n- [\"Security printing and seals\" (from Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch16-dec18.pdf)\n\n### Access control\n\n- [\"Access Control\" (from Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv2-c04.pdf)\n- [OS Security Concepts (from CS 161 from UC Berkeley)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs161/fa16/slides/lec4.pdf)\n- [Understanding Discretionary Access Control In Trusted Systems](https://fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/tg003.htm)\n- [Awesome Object Capabilities and Capability-based Security](https://github.com/dckc/awesome-ocap)\n- [What are capabilities?](http://habitatchronicles.com/2017/05/what-are-capabilities/)\n- [Capability Security Model](https://wiki.c2.com/?CapabilitySecurityModel)\n\n### Authentication\n\nThe three ways to authenticate someone are:\n\n- what you know (eg, PIN, password, picture passwords)\n- what you have (eg, Yubikey, smartphone, smartcard, token hardware)\n- what you are (eg, a fingerprint)\n\nWhile not a standalone factor, you can consider the environment, too, such as where the user is or what time it is.\n\n- [DOD Password Management Guideline](https://fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/std002.htm)\n- [A Guide to Understanding Identification and Authentication in Trusted Systems](https://fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/tg017.htm)\n- [Authentication (from Saydjari's book)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/engineering-trustworthy-systems/9781260118186/ch11.xhtml#ch11)\n\n#### Biometrics\n\n- [\"Biometrics\" (from Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch17-dec20.pdf)\n\n### Authorization\n\nWithout authorization, anyone who authenticates to our system would have full access to everything.

The fact that it clearly is not has some very obvious security implications and attack vectors that we've been living with for decades.\n\n> Beyondcorp tries to more directly answer the original question about device identity rather than subbing in the network question in its place.\n\n> The fact that this approach is novel says a lot about the maturity of our industry.\n\n-- tyler_larson, [a Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16204208), 01/22/2018\n\n#### Architecture\n\n![](images/beyondcorp_architecture.png)\n\n#### Summary\n\n[Google's BeyondCorp](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43231.pdf) removes the concept of firewalls and VPNs altogether.\n\nInstead, every request to access internal services must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted, and that's all -- regardless from what network the request originates from.\n\n#### Authentication\n\nFor a request to be authenticated, it must be from:\n\n- an authenticated user\n- who's on a corporate device (a device in Google's Device Inventory Database, identified with a certificate stored in the device's TPM or in certificate store).\n\n#### Key components\n\n- All of Google's services are put behind an access proxy, which \"enforces encryption between the client and the application\"\n\n  - The user's device must present a valid certificate, and the user must log on via SSO + hardware security key, to pass the access proxy.\n\n- BeyondCorp's Trust Inference dynamically determines how much trust to assign a user or a device\n\n  - The user accessing services from a strange location would decrease trust. A less secure device would decrease trust.\n\n- BeyondCorp's Access Control Engine ingests device inventory data, user data, this trust score, and decides whether to allow access to the requested service or not.\n  - The Access Control Engine can also \"enforce location-based access control\" and can restrict access to services based on user role + device type.\n\n#### End to end flow\n\nQuoting from the paper linked above:\n\n1. The request is directed to the access proxy. The laptop provides its device certificate.\n2. The access proxy does not recognize the user and redirects to the SSO system.\n3. The engineer provides his or her primary and second-factor authentication credentials, is authenticated by the SSO system, is issued a token, and is redirected back to the access proxy.\n4. The access proxy now has the device certificate, which identifies the device, and the SSO token, which identifies the user.\n5. The Access Control Engine performs the specific authorization\n   check configured for codereview.corp.google.com. This authorization check is made on every request:\n   a. The user is confirmed to be in the engineering group.  \n   b. The user is confirmed to possess a sufficient trust level.  \n   c. The device is confirmed to be a managed device in good standing.  \n   d. The device is confirmed to possess a sufficient trust level.  \n   e. If all these checks pass, the request is passed to an appropriate back end to be serviced.  \n   f. If any of the above checks fails, the request is denied.\n\n#### Prereqs for compromising a service\n\nFor an attacker to gain access to a service under BeyondCorp, they'd need to:\n\n1. choose an employee who can access this service\n2. obtain that employee's SSO credentials\n3. obtain an employee's hardware security key\n4. obtain an employee's (any employee's?) managed device which can access this service\n5. obtain the password to this managed device\n6. bypass any location based access control\n7. do all of this before either the user's or device's access is cut off (as every request is checked)\n\n#### Before/after\n\nBefore: the attacker has to execute one digital attack (gain VPN access) to gain access to services.\n\nEven if VPN requires 2FA, but it's not done with a hardware security key, the attacker can phish the employee into giving up his 2FA code or accepting the Duo push.\n\nAfter: the attacker has to execute two digital attacks (obtain SSO password, obtain device password) and two physical attacks, which might be done at once (device, hardware security key).\n\nLearning lesson: shift digital attacks to physical attacks wherever possible (and safe). Google does this using hardware security keys and only letting managed laptops access services.\n\n#### Further reading\n\n- [BeyondCorp I: A new approach to enterprise security](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43231.pdf)\n- [BeyondCorp II: Design to deployment at Google](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/44860.pdf)\n- [BeyondCorp III: The access proxy](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/45728.pdf)\n- [Migrating to BeyondCorp](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/f29b3e764b1122d508b7b53544a3bbadd6cd1101.pdf)\n- [BeyondCorp: The user experience](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/c8da594124dab1f91e6750995e2b7805403b19f1.pdf)\n- [Maintaining a healthy fleet](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/b9b4a09a913e410b7c45f3fbacec4d350e38146f.pdf)\n- [Zero Trust Networks: Building Secure Systems in Untrusted Networks](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Trust-Networks-Building-Untrusted/dp/1491962194)\n\n### Apple\n\n- [Apple platform security](https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1902/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf)\n- [There are no secure smartphones](https://www.devever.net/~hl/nosecuresmartphone) -

below, please submit a pull request, or even easier, just [create an issue](https://github.com/veeral-patel/how-to-secure-anything/issues/new) and I'll add the resources to the repo for you.\n\n- How is online gambling kept secure?\n- How are casino slot machines kept secure both from insiders (see Ocean's 13!) and outsiders?\n- How are facilities containing hazardous biological, chemical material secured?\n- What about nuclear facilities?\n- What security requirements does the DOD have for in its JEDI Cloud?\n- How do chip fabs and bio facilities prevent contamination?\n- Are there any things we can apply from safety engineering to security engineering?\n- Do unhackable systems exist? How would you build one?\n\n## In the future\n\n- Write up case studies on how I'd use my process to secure different things\n- Create practical, step by step checklists for doing each of the parts of my process\n- Have interviews with people who design security for museums, banks, prisons, casinos, etc\n",
