Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap), [monthly iteration plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Iteration-Plans), and our [endgame plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Running-the-Endgame). This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).\n\n## Visual Studio Code\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img alt=\"VS Code in action\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35271042/118224532-3842c400-b438-11eb-923d-a5f66fa6785a.png\">\n</p>\n\n[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a distribution of the `Code - OSS` repository with Microsoft-specific customizations released under a traditional [Microsoft product license](https://code.visualstudio.com/License/).\n\n[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.\n\nVisual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on [Visual Studio Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). To get the latest releases every day, install the [Insiders build](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere are many ways in which you can participate in this project, for example:\n\n* [Submit bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues), and help us verify as they are checked in\n* Review [source code changes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pulls)\n* Review the [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs) and make pull requests for anything from typos to additional and new content\n\nIf you are interested in fixing issues and contributing directly to the code base,\nplease see the document [How to Contribute](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute), which covers the following:\n\n* [How to build and run from source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute)\n* [The development workflow, including debugging and running tests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#debugging)\n* [Coding guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Coding-Guidelines)\n* [Submitting pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#pull-requests)\n* [Finding an issue to work on](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#where-to-contribute)\n* [Contributing to translations](https://aka.ms/vscodeloc)\n\n## Feedback\n\n* Ask a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode)\n* [Request a new feature](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* Upvote [popular feature requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)\n* [File an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues)\n* Connect with the extension author community on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions) or [Slack](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-community)\n* Follow [@code](https://twitter.com/code) and let us know what you think!\n\nSee our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Feedback-Channels) for a description of each of these channels and information on some other available community-driven channels.\n\n## Related Projects\n\nMany of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki).\n\n## Bundled Extensions\n\nVS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.\n\n## Development Container\n\nThis repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.\n\n* For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.\n  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.\n\n* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.\n\nDocker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
