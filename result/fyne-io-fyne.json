Avoid running it before writing code that uses the module to prevent accidental removal of dependencies:\n\n    go mod tidy\n\n# Widget demo\n\nTo run a showcase of the features of Fyne execute the following:\n\n    go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo@latest\n    fyne_demo\n\nAnd you should see something like this (after you click a few buttons):\n\n<p align=\"center\" markdown=\"1\" style=\"max-width: 100%\">\n  <img src=\"img/widgets-dark.png\" width=\"752\" alt=\"Fyne Demo Dark Theme\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" />\n</p>\n\nOr if you are using the light theme:\n\n<p align=\"center\" markdown=\"1\" style=\"max-width: 100%\">\n  <img src=\"img/widgets-light.png\" width=\"752\" alt=\"Fyne Demo Light Theme\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" />\n</p>\n\nAnd even running on a mobile device:\n\n<p align=\"center\" markdown=\"1\" style=\"max-width: 100%\">\n  <img src=\"img/widgets-mobile-light.png\" width=\"348\" alt=\"Fyne Demo Mobile Light Theme\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" />\n</p>\n\n# Getting Started\n\nFyne is designed to be really easy to code with.\nIf you have followed the prerequisite steps above then all you need is a\nGo IDE (or a text editor).\n\nOpen a new file and you're ready to write your first app!\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fyne.io/fyne/v2/app\"\n\t\"fyne.io/fyne/v2/container\"\n\t\"fyne.io/fyne/v2/widget\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\ta := app.New()\n\tw := a.NewWindow(\"Hello\")\n\n\thello := widget.NewLabel(\"Hello Fyne!\")\n\tw.SetContent(container.NewVBox(\n\t\thello,\n\t\twidget.NewButton(\"Hi!\", func() {\n\t\t\thello.SetText(\"Welcome :)\")\n\t\t}),\n\t))\n\n\tw.ShowAndRun()\n}\n```\n\nAnd you can run that simply as:\n\n    go run main.go\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> The first compilation of Fyne on Windows _can_ take up to 10 minutes, depending on your hardware. Subsequent builds will be fast.\n\nIt should look like this:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: auto; border-collapse: collapse;\">\n    <tr style=\"border: none;\"><td style=\"border: none;\">\n      <img src=\"img/hello-light.png\" width=\"207\" alt=\"Fyne Hello Dark Theme\" />\n    </td><td style=\"border: none;\">\n      <img src=\"img/hello-dark.png\" width=\"207\" alt=\"Fyne Hello Dark Theme\" />\n    </td></tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n## Run in mobile simulation\n\nThere is a helpful mobile simulation mode that gives a hint of how your app would work on a mobile device:\n\n    go run -tags mobile main.go\n\nAnother option is to use `fyne` command, see [Packaging for mobile](#packaging-for-mobile).\n\n# Installing\n\nUsing `go install` will copy the executable into your go `bin` dir.\nTo install the application with icons etc into your operating system's standard\napplication location you can use the fyne utility and the \"install\" subcommand.\n\n    go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne@latest\n    fyne install\n\n# Packaging for mobile\n\nTo run on a mobile device it is necessary to package up the application.\nTo do this we can use the fyne utility \"package\" subcommand.\nYou will need to add appropriate parameters as prompted, but the basic command is shown below.\nOnce packaged you can install using the platform development tools or the fyne \"install\" subcommand.\n\n    fyne package -os android -appID my.domain.appname\n    fyne install -os android\n\nThe built Android application can run either in a real device or an Android emulator.\nHowever, building for iOS is slightly different.\nIf the \"-os\" argument is \"ios\", it is build only for a real iOS device.\nSpecify \"-os\" to \"iossimulator\" allows the application be able to run in an iOS simulator:\n\n    fyne package -os ios -appID my.domain.appname\n    fyne package -os iossimulator -appID my.domain.appname\n\n# Preparing a release\n\nUsing the fyne utility \"release\" subcommand you can package up your app for release\nto app stores and market places. Make sure you have the standard build tools installed\nand have followed the platform documentation for setting up accounts and signing.\nThen you can execute something like the following, notice the `-os ios` parameter allows\nbuilding an iOS app from macOS computer. Other combinations work as well :)\n\n    $ fyne release -os ios -certificate \"Apple Distribution\" -profile \"My App Distribution\" -appID \"com.example.myapp\"\n\nThe above command will create a '.ipa' file that can then be uploaded to the iOS App Store.\n\n# Documentation\n\nMore documentation is available at the [Fyne developer website](https://developer.fyne.io/) or on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/fyne.io/fyne/v2?tab=doc).\n\n# Examples\n\nYou can find many example applications in the [examples repository](https://github.com/fyne-io/examples/).\nAlternatively a list of applications using fyne can be found at [our website](https://apps.fyne.io/).\n\n# Shipping the Fyne Toolkit\n\nAll Fyne apps will work without pre-installed libraries, this is one reason the apps are so portable.\nHowever, if looking to support Fyne in a bigger way on your operating system then you can install some utilities that help to make a more complete experience.\n\n## Additional apps\n\nIt is recommended that you install the following additional apps:\n\n| app           | go install                          | description                                                            |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| fyne_settings | `fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_settings` | A GUI for managing your global Fyne settings like theme and scaling    |\n| apps          | `github.com/fyne-io/apps`           | A graphical installer for the Fyne apps listed at https://apps.fyne.io |\n\nThese are optional applications but can help to create a more complete desktop experience.\n\n## FyneDesk (Linux / BSD)\n\nTo go all the way with Fyne on your desktop / laptop computer you could install [FyneDesk](https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk) as well :)\n\n![FyneDesk screenshopt in dark mode](https://fyshos.com/img/desktop.png)\n",
