Visit the link below:\n\n- Documentation - **English Version**  [https://imageai.readthedocs.io](https://imageai.readthedocs.io)\n\n\n## Sponsors\n<div id=\"sponsors\"></div>\n\n\n## Real-Time and High Performance Implementation\n<div id=\"performance\"></div>\n\n**ImageAI** provides abstracted and convenient implementations of state-of-the-art Computer Vision technologies. All of **ImageAI** implementations and code can work on any computer system with moderate CPU capacity. However, the speed of processing for operations like image prediction, object detection and others on CPU is slow and not suitable for real-time applications. To perform real-time Computer Vision operations with high performance, you need to use GPU enabled technologies.\n\n**ImageAI** uses the PyTorch backbone for it's Computer Vision operations. PyTorch supports both CPUs and GPUs ( Specifically NVIDIA GPUs.  You can get one for your PC or get a PC that has one) for machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms' implementations.\n\n\n\n## Projects Built on ImageAI\n<div id=\"sample\"></div>\n\n\n\n## AI Practice Recommendations\n<div id=\"recommendation\"></div>\n\nFor anyone interested in building AI systems and using them for business, economic,  social and research purposes, it is critical that the person knows the likely positive, negative and unprecedented impacts the use of such technologies will have.\nThey must also be aware of approaches and practices recommended by experienced industry experts to ensure every use of AI brings overall benefit to mankind.\nWe therefore recommend to everyone that wishes to use ImageAI and other AI tools and resources to read Microsoft's January 2018 publication on AI titled \"The Future Computed : Artificial Intelligence and its role in society\".\nKindly follow the link below to download the publication.\n\n[https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/01/17/future-computed-artificial-intelligence-role-society](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/01/17/future-computed-artificial-intelligence-role-society/)\n\n### Contact Developer\n<div id=\"contact\"></div>\n\n- **Moses Olafenwa**\n    * _Email:_ guymodscientist@gmail.com\n    * _Twitter:_ [@OlafenwaMoses](https://twitter.com/OlafenwaMoses)\n    * _Medium:_ [@guymodscientist](https://medium.com/@guymodscientist)\n    * _Facebook:_ [moses.olafenwa](https://facebook.com/moses.olafenwa)\n- **John Olafenwa**\n    * _Email:_ johnolafenwa@gmail.com\n    * _Website:_ [https://john.aicommons.science](https://john.aicommons.science)\n    * _Twitter:_ [@johnolafenwa](https://twitter.com/johnolafenwa)\n    * _Medium:_ [@johnolafenwa](https://medium.com/@johnolafenwa)\n    * _Facebook:_ [olafenwajohn](https://facebook.com/olafenwajohn)\n\n\n### Citation\n<div id=\"citation\"></div>\n\nYou can cite **ImageAI** in your projects and research papers via the **BibTeX** entry below.  \n  \n```\n@misc {ImageAI,\n    author = \"Moses\",\n    title  = \"ImageAI, an open source python library built to empower developers to build applications and systems  with self-contained Computer Vision capabilities\",\n    url    = \"https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI\",\n    month  = \"mar\",\n    year   = \"2018--\"\n}\n```\n\n\n\n ### References\n <div id=\"ref\"></div>\n\n 1.
