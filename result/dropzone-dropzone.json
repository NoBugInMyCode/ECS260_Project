If you don't care about IE but about size, you can already\n> opt into `6.0.0-beta.1`. Please make sure to pin the specific version since\n> parts of the API might change slightly. You can always read about the changes\n> in the [`CHANGELOG`](./CHANGELOG.md) file.\n\n## Community\n\nIf you need support please use the [discussions section][discussions] or\n[stackoverflow][so] with the `dropzone.js` tag and **not** the GitHub issues\ntracker. Only post an issue here if you think you discovered a bug.\n\nIf you have a feature request or want to discuss something, please use the\n[discussions][] as well.\n\n[discussions]: https://github.com/dropzone/dropzone/discussions\n[so]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dropzone.js\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you\n> start working on Dropzone!**\n\n## Main features \u2705\n\n- Beautiful by default\n- Image thumbnail previews. Simply register the callback `thumbnail(file, data)`\n  and display the image wherever you like\n- High-DPI screen support\n- Multiple files and synchronous uploads\n- Progress updates\n- Support for large files\n  - Chunked uploads (upload large files in smaller chunks)\n- Support for Amazon S3 Multipart upload\n- Complete theming. The look and feel of Dropzone is just the default theme. You\n  can define everything yourself by overwriting the default event listeners.\n- Browser image resizing (resize the images before you upload them to your\n  server)\n- Well tested\n\n# MIT License\n\nSee the [LICENSE](https://github.com/dropzone/dropzone/blob/main/LICENSE) file\n",
