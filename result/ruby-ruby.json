It also offers many scripting features\nto process plain text and serialized files, or manage system tasks.\nIt is simple, straightforward, and extensible.\n\n## Features of Ruby\n\n* Simple Syntax\n* **Normal** Object-oriented Features (e.g. class, method calls)\n* **Advanced** Object-oriented Features (e.g. mix-in, singleton-method)\n* Operator Overloading\n* Exception Handling\n* Iterators and Closures\n* Garbage Collection\n* Dynamic Loading of Object Files (on some architectures)\n* Highly Portable (works on many Unix-like/POSIX compatible platforms as\n  well as Windows, macOS, etc.) cf.\n    https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/maintainers_md.html#label-Platform+Maintainers\n\n## How to get Ruby\n\nFor a complete list of ways to install Ruby, including using third-party tools\nlike rvm, see:\n\nhttps://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/\n\nYou can download release packages and the snapshot of the repository. If you want to\ndownload whole versions of Ruby, please visit https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/releases/.\n\n### Download with Git\n\nThe mirror of the Ruby source tree can be checked out with the following command:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/ruby/ruby.git\n\nThere are some other branches under development. Try the following command\nto see the list of branches:\n\n    $ git ls-remote https://github.com/ruby/ruby.git\n\nYou may also want to use https://git.ruby-lang.org/ruby.git (actual master of Ruby source)\nif you are a committer.\n\n## How to build\n\nSee [Building Ruby](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/contributing/building_ruby_md.html)\n\n## Ruby home page\n\nhttps://www.ruby-lang.org/\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [English](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/index.html)\n- [Japanese](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/ja/master/index.html)\n\n## Mailing list\n\nThere is a mailing list to discuss Ruby. To subscribe to this list, please\nsend the following phrase:\n\n    join\n\nin the mail subject (not body) to the address [ruby-talk-request@ml.ruby-lang.org].\n\n[ruby-talk-request@ml.ruby-lang.org]: mailto:ruby-talk-request@ml.ruby-lang.org?subject=join\n\n## Copying\n\nSee the file [COPYING](rdoc-ref:COPYING).\n\n## Feedback\n\nQuestions about the Ruby language can be asked on the [Ruby-Talk](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/mailing-lists) mailing list\nor on websites like https://stackoverflow.com.\n\nBugs should be reported at https://bugs.ruby-lang.org. Read [\"Reporting Issues\"](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/contributing/reporting_issues_md.html) for more information.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [\"Contributing to Ruby\"](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/contributing_md.html), which includes setup and build instructions.\n\n## The Author\n\nRuby was originally designed and developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) in 1995.\n\n<matz@ruby-lang.org>\n",
