This helps address some common performance bottlenecks:\n1. It reduces the amount of work (and time) required to render the initial view and to process updates.\n2. It reduces the memory footprint by avoiding over-allocation of DOM nodes.\n\n### Sponsors\n\nThe following wonderful companies have sponsored react-window:\n\n<a

more at [react-window.now.sh](https://react-window.now.sh/):\n\n## Related libraries\n\n* [`react-virtualized-auto-sizer`](https://npmjs.com/package/react-virtualized-auto-sizer): HOC that grows to fit all of the available space and passes the width and height values to its child.\n* [`react-window-infinite-loader`](https://npmjs.com/package/react-window-infinite-loader): Helps break large data sets down into chunks that can be just-in-time loaded as they are scrolled into view. It can also be used to create infinite loading lists (e.g. Facebook or Twitter).\n* [`react-vtree`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-vtree): Lightweight and flexible solution to render large tree structures (e.g., file system).\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### How is `react-window` different from `react-virtualized`?\nI wrote `react-virtualized` several years ago. At the time, I was new to both React and the concept of windowing. Because of this, I made a few API decisions that I later came to regret. One of these was adding too many non-essential features and components. Once you add something to an open source project, removing it is pretty painful for users.\n\n`react-window` is a complete rewrite of `react-virtualized`. I didn't try to solve as many problems or support as many use cases. Instead I focused on making the package **smaller**<sup>1</sup> and **faster**. I also put a lot of thought into making the API (and documentation) as beginner-friendly as possible (with the caveat that windowing is still kind of an advanced use case).\n\nIf `react-window` provides the functionality your project needs, I would strongly recommend using it instead of `react-virtualized`. However if you need features that only `react-virtualized` provides, you have two options:\n\n1. Use `react-virtualized`. (It's still widely used by a lot of successful projects!)\n2. Create a component that decorates one of the `react-window` primitives and adds the functionality you need. You may even want to release this component to NPM (as its own, standalone package)! \ud83d\ude42\n\n<sup>1 - Adding a `react-virtualized` list to a CRA project increases the (gzipped) build size by ~33.5 KB. Adding a `react-window` list to a CRA project increases the (gzipped) build size by &lt;2 KB.</sup>\n\n### Can a list or a grid fill 100% the width or height of a page?\n\nYes. I recommend using the [`react-virtualized-auto-sizer` package](https://npmjs.com/package/react-virtualized-auto-sizer):\n\n<img width=\"336\" alt=\"screen shot 2019-03-07 at 7 29 08 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/54005716-50f41880-410f-11e9-864f-a65bbdf49e07.png\">\n\nHere's a [Code Sandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/3vnx878jk5).\n\n### Why is my list blank when I scroll?\n\nIf your list looks something like this...\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/54005352-eb535c80-410d-11e9-80b2-d3d02db1f599.gif\" width=\"302\" height=\"152\">\n\n...then you probably forgot to use the `style` parameter! Libraries like react-window work by absolutely positioning the list items (via an inline style), so don't forget to attach it to the DOM element you render!\n\n<img width=\"257\" alt=\"screen shot 2019-03-07 at 7 21 48 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/54005433-45ecb880-410e-11e9-8721-420ff1a153da.png\">\n\n### Can I lazy load data for my list?\n\nYes.
