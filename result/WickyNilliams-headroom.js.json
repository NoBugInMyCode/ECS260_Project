        "readme": "# Headroom.js\n\nHeadroom.js is a lightweight, high-performance JS widget (with no dependencies) that allows you to react to the user's scroll. The header on [this site](http://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js) is a living example, it slides out of view when scrolling down and slides back in when scrolling up.\n\n## Installation\n\nHeadroom.js is available on npm. To install:\n\n```bash\nnpm install headroom.js --save\n\n# or...\nyarn add headroom.js\n```\n\nA a universal build (suitable for script tags, CommonJS, and AMD) is available from unpkg.com:\n\n[https://unpkg.com/headroom.js](https://unpkg.com/headroom.js)\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor complete documentation please visit the [headroom.js website](http://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js).\n\n## Quick start\n\nAfter installing `headroom.js`. The following JS will create and initialise a headroom instance:\n\n```js\nimport Headroom from \"headroom.js\";\n\n// select your header or whatever element you wish\nconst header = document.querySelector(\"header\");\n\nconst headroom = new Headroom(header);\nheadroom.init();\n```\n\nThen you can add the following CSS to your page:\n\n```css\n.headroom {\n  will-change: transform;\n  transition: transform 200ms linear;\n}\n.headroom--pinned {\n  transform: translateY(0%);\n}\n.headroom--unpinned {\n  transform: translateY(-100%);\n}\n```\n\nYou should now see your header slide in and out in response to the user's scroll.\n\n## Contributions & Issues\n\nContributions are welcome. Please clearly explain the purpose of the PR and follow the current code style.\n\nIssues can be resolved quickest if they are descriptive and include both a reduced test case and a set of steps to reproduce.\n\n## Contributing Guide\n\n### Setup\n\nThe following steps will get you setup to contribute changes to this repo:\n\n1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of [this page](https://github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js))\n2. Clone your fork locally\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/headroom.js.git\ncd headroom.js\n```\n\n3. Install dependencies. This repo uses `npm`, so you should too.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Building\n\nTo build the project:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nTo start a watcher for building the project and running tests:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nTo run the test suite in headless mode:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\n",
