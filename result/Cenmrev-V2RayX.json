USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.)\n\n## Download V2RayX\n\nDownload from [Releases](https://github.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX/releases). (compiled by [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/Cenmrev/V2RayX)).\n\nBy [Homebrew-Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/).\n\n```sh\nbrew cask install v2rayx\n```\n\n## How to build\n\nV2RayX.app is built by running one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the command-line with curl.\n\n`sh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX/master/compilefromsource.sh)\"`\n\nor step by step:\n\n`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX.git`\n\nopen V2RayX.xcodeproj and use Xcode to build V2RayX.\n\n## How does V2RayX work\n\nV2RayX provides a GUI to generate the config file for V2Ray. It includes V2Ray's binary executable in the app bundle. V2RayX starts and stops V2Ray with `launchd` of macOS.\n\nV2RayX also allows users to change system proxy settings and switch proxy servers on the macOS menu bar.\n\nAs default, V2RayX will open a socks5 proxy at port `1081` as the main inbound, as well as a http proxy at port `8001` as an inboundDetour.\n\nV2RayX provide three modes:\n* Global Mode: V2RayX asks macOS to route all internet traffic to v2ray core if the network traffic obeys operating system's network rules.\n* PAC Mode: macOS will determine the routing based on a pac file and some traffic may be routed to v2ray core.\n* Manual Mode: V2RayX will not modify any macOS network settings, but only start or stop v2ray core.\n\nOptions in menu list `Routing Rule` determine how v2ray core deals with incoming traffic. Core routing rules apply to all three modes above.\n\n### auto-run on login\n\nOpen macOS System Preferences -> Users & Group -> Login Items, add V2RayX.app to\nthe list.\n\n### manually update v2ray-core\nreplace `V2RayX.app/Contents/Resources/v2ray` with the newest v2ray \nversion from [v2ray-core \nrepo](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/releases). However, compatibility is not guaranteed.\n\n### Uninstall\n\nV2RayX will create the following files and folders:\n\n* `/Library/Application Support/V2RayX`\n* `~/Library/Application Support/V2RayX`\n* `~/Library/Preferences/cenmrev.V2RayX.plist`\n\nSo, to totally uninstall V2RayX, just delete V2RayX.app and the files above. :)\n\n## Acknowledge\n\nV2RayX uses [GCDWebServer](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer) to provide a local pac server. V2RayX also uses many ideas and codes from [ShadowsocksX](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-iOS/tree/master), especially, the codes of [v2rays_sysconfig](https://github.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX/blob/master/v2rayx_sysconf/main.m) are simply copied from [shadowsocks_sysconf](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-iOS/blob/master/shadowsocks_sysconf/main.m) with some modifications.\n\n## Donation\n\nIf Project V2Ray or V2RayX helped you, you can also help us by donation __in your will__. To donate to Project V2Ray, you may refer to [this page](https://www.v2ray.com/chapter_00/02_donate.html).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis tool is mainly for personal usage. For professional users and technique \nsupport, commercial software like proxifier is recommended. Please refer to [#60](https://github.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX/issues/60#issuecomment-369531443).\n\nThe developer does not major in CS nor Software Engineer and currently is busy with grad school courses. So V2rayX will not be updated frequently. Users can replace V2RayX.app/Contents/Resources/v2ray with the newest v2ray-core downloaded from [https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/releases](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/releases).\n\nThe developer currently does not have enough time to add more features to V2RayX, nor to merge PRs. However, forking and releasing your own version are always welcome.\n",
