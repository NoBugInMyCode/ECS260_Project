Please help us to translate.\n\nSee <https://javascript.info/translate> for the details.\n\n## Contributions\n\nWe'd also like to collaborate on the tutorial with other people.\n\nSomething's wrong? A topic is missing? Explain it to people, add it as PR \ud83d\udc4f\n\n**You can edit the text in any editor.** The tutorial uses an enhanced \"markdown\" format, easy to grasp. And if you want to see how it looks on-site, there's a server to run the tutorial locally at <https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/server>.\n\nThe list of contributors is available at <https://javascript.info/about#contributors>.\n\n## Structure\n\nEvery chapter, article, or task has its folder.\n\nThe folder is named like `N-url`, where `N` is a number for the sorting purposes and `URL` is the URL part with the title of the material.\n\nThe type of the material is defined by the file inside the folder:\n\n  - `index.md` stands for a chapter\n  - `article.md` stands for an article\n  - `task.md` stands for a task (solution must be provided in `solution.md` file as well)\n\nEach of these files starts from the `# Main header`.\n\nIt's very easy to add something new.\n\n---  \n\u2665  \nIlya Kantor @iliakan\n",
