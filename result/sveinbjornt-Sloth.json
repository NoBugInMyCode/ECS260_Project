This makes it easy to inspect which apps are using which files, etc.\n\n* View all open files, directories, IP sockets, devices, Unix domain sockets, and pipes\n* Filter by name, access mode, volume, type, location, or using regular expressions\n* Sort by process name, file count, type, process ID, user ID, Carbon PSN, bundle UTI, etc.\n* View IP socket status, protocol, port and version\n* View sockets and pipes established between processes\n* Inspection window with detailed macOS and Unix file/socket/process info\n* Powerful contextual menu for file operations\n* In-app authentication to run with root privileges\n* Very fast, responsive native app written in Objective-C/Cocoa\n\nSloth is essentially a friendly, exploratory graphical user interface built on top of the  [`lsof`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lsof) command line tool. The output of `lsof` is parsed and shown in a sortable, searchable outline view with all sorts of convenient additional functionality.

Older versions supporting macOS 10.8 and earlier can be downloaded [here](https://sveinbjorn.org/files/software/sloth/).\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\n#### View open files\n\n<a href=\"resources/sloth_screenshot1.jpg\">\n<img src=\"resources/sloth_screenshot1.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"Sloth Screenshot 1 - Files\">\n</a>\n\n#### View IP sockets\n\n<a href=\"resources/sloth_screenshot2.jpg\">\n<img src=\"resources/sloth_screenshot2.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"Sloth Screenshot 2 - IP Sockets\">\n</a>\n\n#### View sockets and pipes between processes\n\n<a href=\"resources/sloth_screenshot3.jpg\">\n<img src=\"resources/sloth_screenshot3.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"Sloth Screenshot 3 - Pipes and Unix Sockets\">\n</a>\n\n## Build\n\nSloth can be built using a reasonably modern version of Xcode via the `xcodeproj` or by running the following command in the repository root (requires Xcode build tools):\n\n```\nmake\n```\n\nBuilt products are created in `products/`.\n\n## BSD License \n\nCopyright (c) 2004-2024 Sveinbjorn Thordarson\n&lt;<a href=\"mailto:sveinbjorn@sveinbjorn.org\">sveinbjorn@sveinbjorn.org</a>&gt;\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
