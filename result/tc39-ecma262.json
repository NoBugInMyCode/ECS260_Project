You can then do `npm run build` to build the spec or `npm run watch` to set up a continuous build. The results will appear in the `out` directory, which you can use `npm run clean` to delete.\n\n## Community\n\n* [ES discourse](https://es.discourse.group/): Forum for ECMAScript discussion and questions\n* [Matrix](https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/HEAD/matrix-guide.md): Chat\n",
