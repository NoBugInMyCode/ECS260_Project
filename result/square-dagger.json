In order to activate code generation you will need to\ninclude `dagger-compiler-${dagger.version}.jar` in your build at compile time.\n\nIn a Maven project, one would include the runtime in the dependencies section\nof your `pom.xml` (replacing `${dagger.version}` with the appropriate current\nrelease), and the `dagger-compiler` artifact as an \"optional\" or \"provided\"\ndependency:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>com.squareup.dagger</groupId>\n    <artifactId>dagger</artifactId>\n    <version>${dagger.version}</version>\n  </dependency>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>com.squareup.dagger</groupId>\n    <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId>\n    <version>${dagger.version}</version>\n    <optional>true</optional>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nYou can also find downloadable .jars on Maven Central. You'll need\n[Dagger][dl-dagger], [JavaPoet][dl-javapoet], and [javax.inject][dl-inject].\n\nSnapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].\n\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n    Copyright 2012 Square, Inc.\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n\n\n [1]: http://square.github.com/dagger/\n [dl-dagger]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.squareup.dagger%22%20a%3A%22dagger%22\n [dl-javapoet]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.squareup%22%20a%3A%22javapoet%22\n [dl-inject]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22javax.inject%22%20a%3A%22javax.inject%22\n [snap]: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/\n",
