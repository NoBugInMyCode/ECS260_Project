        "readme": "h1. elasticsearch-head\n\nh2. A web front end for an Elasticsearch cluster\n\nh3. \"http://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head\":http://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head\n\nh2. Running\n\nThere are multiple ways of running elasticsearch-head.\n\nh4. Running with built in server\n\n* @git clone git://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head.git@\n* @cd elasticsearch-head@\n* @npm install@\n* @npm run start@\n\n* @open@ \"http://localhost:9100/\":http://localhost:9100/\n\nThis will start a local webserver running on port 9100 serving elasticsearch-head\n\nh4. Running with docker\n\n* for Elasticsearch 5.x: @docker run -p 9100:9100 mobz/elasticsearch-head:5@\n* for Elasticsearch 2.x: @docker run -p 9100:9100 mobz/elasticsearch-head:2@\n* for Elasticsearch 1.x: @docker run -p 9100:9100 mobz/elasticsearch-head:1@\n* for fans of alpine there is @mobz/elasticsearch-head:5-alpine@\n  \n* @open@ \"http://localhost:9100/\":http://localhost:9100/\n\nh4. Running as a Chrome extension\n\n* Install \"ElasticSearch Head\":https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elasticsearch-head/ffmkiejjmecolpfloofpjologoblkegm/ from the Chrome Web Store.\n* Click the extension icon in the toolbar of your web browser.\n* Note that you don't need to \"enable CORS\":#enable-cors-in-elasticsearch with this method.\n\nh4. Running as a plugin of Elasticsearch (deprecated)\n\n* for Elasticsearch 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x: site plugins are not supported. Run \"as a standalone server\":#running-with-built-in-server\n* for Elasticsearch 2.x: @sudo elasticsearch/bin/plugin install mobz/elasticsearch-head@\n* for Elasticsearch 1.x: @sudo elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head/1.x@\n* for Elasticsearch 0.x: @sudo elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head/0.9@\n\n* @open http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/@\n\nThis will automatically download the appropriate version of elasticsearch-head from github and run it as a plugin within the elasticsearch cluster. In this mode elasticsearch-head automatically connects to the node that is running it\n\nh4. Running with the local proxy\n\nThis is an _experimental feature_ which creates a local proxy for many remote elasticsearch clusters\n\n* configure clusters in proxy/clusters\n* create a file per remote cluster you want to connect to ( see @localhost9200.json@ as example )\n* requires node >= 6.0 \n* @npm install@\n* @npm run proxy@\n\nAt the moment it only works with @grunt server@ running on http://localhost:9100\n\nh4. Alternatives\n\n* File System: elastisearch-head is a standalone webapp written in good-ol' html5. This means, you can put it up on any webserver, run it directly from the filesystem. It'll even fit on a floppy disk.\n* DEB package: There is an unofficial deb package. the plugin executable will be available at @/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin@.\n* Homebrew: There is an unofficial keg. The plugin executable will be available at @/usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/(elasticsearch version)/libexec/bin/plugin@.\n\nh3. Connecting to elasticsearch\n\nBy default elasticsearch exposes a http rest API on port 9200 which elasticsearch-head connects to.\n\nh4. Enable CORS in elasticsearch\n\nWhen not running as a Chrome extension or as a plugin of elasticsearch (which is not even possible from version 5), you must enable \"CORS\":https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-http.html in elasticsearch, or else your browser will reject elasticsearch-head's requests due to violation of the same-origin policy.\n\nIn elasticsearch configuration;\n\n* add @http.cors.enabled: true@\n* you must also set @http.cors.allow-origin@ because no origin allowed by default. @http.cors.allow-origin: \"*\"@ is valid value, however it's considered as a security risk as your cluster is open to cross origin from *anywhere*.\n\nh4. Basic Authentication\n\nelasticsearch-head will add basic auth headers to each request if you pass in the \"correct url parameters\":#url-parameters\nYou will also need to add @http.cors.allow-headers: Authorization@ to the elasticsearch configuration\n\nh4. x-pack\n\nelasticsearch x-pack requires basic authentication _and_ CORS as described above. Make sure you have the correct CORS setup and then open es-head with a url like \"http://localhost:9100/?auth_user=elastic&auth_password=changeme\"\n\nh4. URL Parameters\n\nParameters may be appended to the url to set an initial state eg. @head/index.html?base_uri=http://node-01.example.com:9200@\n\n* @base_uri@ force elasticsearch-head to connect to a particular node.\n* @dashboard@ experimental feature to open elasticsearch-head in a mode suitable for dashboard / radiator. Accepts one parameter @dashboard=cluster@\n* @auth_user@ adds basic auth credentials to http requests ( requires \"elasticsearch-http-basic\":https://github.com/karussell/elasticsearch-http-basic plugin or a reverse proxy )\n* @auth_password@ basic auth password as above (note: without \"additional security layers\":http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/988/is-basic-auth-secure-if-done-over-https, passwords are sent over the network *in the clear* )\n* @lang@ force elasticsearch-head to use specified ui language (eg: en, fr, pt, zh, zh-TW, tr, ja)\n\nh4. Contributing\n\nTo contribute to elasticsearch-head you will need the following developer tools\n\n# git and a \"github\":https://github.com/ account\n# \"node ( including npm )\":http://nodejs.org/download\n# \"grunt-cli\":http://gruntjs.com/getting-started\n# (to run jasmine tests) \"phantomjs\":http://phantomjs.org\n\nThen\n\n# create a fork of elasticsearch-head on github\n# clone your fork to your machine\n# @cd elasticsearch-head@\n# @npm install@ # downloads node dev dependencies\n# @grunt dev@ # builds the distribution files, then watches the src directory for changes (if you have an warning like \"Warning: Task \"clean\" failed. Use --force to continue.\", well use --force ;) )\n\nChanges to both _site and src directories *must* be committed, to allow people to \nrun elasticsearch-head without running dev tools and follow existing dev patterns, \nsuch as indenting with tabs.\n\nh5.
