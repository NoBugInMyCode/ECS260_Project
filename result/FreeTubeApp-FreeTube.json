While it should work well for most users, there are still bugs and missing features that need to be addressed.\n>\n> If you have an idea or if you found a bug, please submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube/issues/new/choose) so that we can track it.  Please search [the existing issues](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube/issues) before submitting to prevent duplicates!\n\n## Screenshots\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zFgZUUV.png\" width=300> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9evYHgN.png\" width=300> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yT2UzPa.png\" width=300> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/47zIEt4.png\" width=300> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hFB2fKC.png\" width=300>\n\n## How does it work?\nFreeTube uses a built in extractor to grab and serve data / videos. The [Invidious API](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) can also optionally be used. FreeTube does not use any official APIs to obtain data. While YouTube can still see your video requests, it can no\nlonger track you using cookies or JavaScript. Your subscriptions and history are stored locally on your computer and never sent out.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Using a VPN or Tor is highly recommended to hide your IP while using FreeTube.\n\n## Features\n* Watch videos without ads\n* Use YouTube without Google tracking you using cookies and JavaScript\n* Two extractor APIs to choose from (Built in or Invidious)\n* Subscribe to channels without an account\n* Connect to an externally setup proxy such as Tor\n* View and search your local subscriptions, history, and saved videos\n* Organize your subscriptions into \"Profiles\" to create a more focused feed\n* Export & import subscriptions\n* Youtube Trending\n* Youtube Chapters\n* Most popular videos page based on the set Invidious instance\n* SponsorBlock \n* Open videos from your browser directly into FreeTube (with extension)\n* Watch videos using an external player\n* Full Theme support\n* Make a screenshot of a video\n* Multiple windows\n* Mini Player (Picture-in-Picture)\n* Keyboard shortcuts\n* Option to show only family friendly content\n* Show/hide functionality or elements within the app using the distraction free settings\n* View channel community posts\n\n### Browser Extensions\nThe following extensions open YouTube links directly in FreeTube:\n\n- [LibRedirect](https://libredirect.github.io/)\n- [RedirectTube](https://github.com/MStankiewiczOfficial/RedirectTube)\n\nLibRedirect automatically redirect YouTube links to FreeTube.\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> To ensure proper functionality, select FreeTube as Frontend in the Services settings of the extension.\n\nRedirectTube, doesn\u2019t automatically open YouTube links in FreeTube. Instead, it adds buttons to the toolbar and context menu, which you can click to open videos in FreeTube manually.\n\n- Download LibRedirect from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/libredirect/) (for Firefox based-browsers) or [developer's website](https://libredirect.github.io/download_chromium.html) (for Chrome and Chromium-based browsers).\n\n- Download RedirectTube from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/redirecttube/) (for Firefox based-browsers).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> These extensions do not work on Linux portable builds!\n>\n> If you have issues with the extension working with FreeTube, please create an issue in this repository instead of the extension repository.\n\n## Download Links\n### Official Downloads\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> FreeTube is only supported on Windows 10 and later, macOS 11 and above, and various Linux distributions.
