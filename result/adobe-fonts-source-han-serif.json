In addition to functional OpenType fonts, this open source project provides all of the source files that were used to build these OpenType fonts by using the [AFDKO](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/) tools.\n\n## Download the fonts (OTF, OTC, Super OTC, Subset OTF, Variable OTF/TTF/WOFF2)\n\nIndividual font resources or ZIP files for various deployment configurations are available for download:\n\n* [Latest release](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/tree/release#downloading-source-han-serif)\n\nTo help decide which fonts to download, please refer to the Configurations section of the [official font readme file](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/raw/release/SourceHanSerifReadMe.pdf). Those who are unfamiliar with GitHub are encouraged to reference the [official Source Han download guide](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/raw/release/download-guide-source-han.pdf), which is provided in English, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.\n\nYou can also download entire [releases](../../releases) that include all available configurations in three ZIP files.\n\n## Building the fonts from source\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo build the binary font files from source, you need to have installed the [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/) (AFDKO). The AFDKO tools are widely used for font development today, and are part of most font editor applications.\n\n### Build all fonts\n\nIn this repository, all necessary files are in place for building the fonts. The [COMMANDS.txt](COMMANDS.txt) file provides the command lines that are used.\n\n## Getting Involved\n\nFor any suggestions for changes, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/issues) for consideration.\n\n## Further information\n\nFor information about the design and background of Source Han Serif, please refer to the [design guide](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/raw/release/SourceHanSerifDesignGuide.pdf) and [official font readme file](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/raw/release/SourceHanSerifReadMe.pdf).\n",
