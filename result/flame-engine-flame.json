Add the\n[Flame tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flame), to make sure that anyone following\nthe tag can help out.\n\n\n## Features\n\nThe goal of the Flame Engine is to provide a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for common\nproblems that games developed with Flutter might share.\n\nSome of the key features provided are:\n\n- A game loop.\n- A component/object system (FCS).\n- Effects and particles.\n- Collision detection.\n- Gesture and input handling.\n- Images, animations, sprites, and sprite sheets.\n- General utilities to make development easier.\n\nOn top of those features, you can augment Flame with bridge packages. Through these libraries,\nyou will be able to access bindings to other packages, including custom Flame components and\nhelpers, in order to make integrations seamless.\n\nFlame officially provides bridge libraries to the following packages:\n\n- [flame_audio][flame_audio] for [AudioPlayers][audioplayers]: Play multiple audio files\nsimultaneously.\n- [flame_bloc][flame_bloc] for [Bloc][bloc]: A predictable state management library.\n- [flame_fire_atlas][flame_fire_atlas] for [FireAtlas][fireatlas]: Create texture atlases for games.\n- [flame_forge2d][flame_forge2d] for [Forge2D][forge2d]: A Box2D physics engine.\n- [flame_isolate][flame_isolate] - Makes it easy to use [Flutter Isolates][flutter_isolates] in\na Flame game.\n- [flame_lint][flame_lint] - Our set of linting (`analysis_options.yaml`) rules.\n- [flame_lottie][flame_lottie] - Support for [Lottie][lottie] animation in Flame.\n- [flame_network_assets][flame_network_assets] - Helpers to load game assets from\nnetwork.\n- [flame_oxygen][flame_oxygen] for [Oxygen][oxygen]: A lightweight Entity Component System (ECS)\nframework.\n- [flame_rive][flame_rive] for [Rive][rive]: Create interactive animations.\n- [flame_svg][flame_svg] for [flutter_svg][flutter_svg]: Draw SVG files in Flutter.\n- [flame_tiled][flame_tiled] for [Tiled][tiled]: 2D tile map level editor.\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\nThe Flame Engine's top sponsors:\n\n[![Very Good Ventures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flame-engine/flame/main/media/unicorn_two_toned.png)](https://verygood.ventures/)\n\n[![Cypher Stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flame-engine/flame/main/media/logo_cypherstack.png)](https://cypherstack.com/)\n\nDo you or your company want to sponsor Flame?\nCheck out our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/blue-fire), which is also mentioned\nin the section below, or contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pxrBmy4).\n\n\n## Support\n\nThe simplest way to show us your support is by giving the project a star! :star:\n\nYou can also support us monetarily by donating through OpenCollective:\n\n<a href=\"https://opencollective.com/blue-fire/donate\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <img src=\"https://opencollective.com/blue-fire/donate/button@2x.png?color=blue\" width=200 />\n</a>\n\nThrough GitHub Sponsors:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/bluefireteam\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <img\n    src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Github%20Sponsor-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white\"\n    width=200\n  />\n</a>\n\nOr by becoming a patron on Patreon:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bluefireoss\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <img src=\"https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png\" width=200 />\n</a>\n\nYou can also show on your repository that your game is made with Flame by using one of the following\nbadges:\n\n[![Powered by Flame](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-%F0%9F%94%A5-272727.svg)](https://flame-engine.org)\n[![Powered by Flame](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-%F0%9F%94%A5-272727.svg?style=flat-square)](https://flame-engine.org)\n[![Powered by Flame](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-%F0%9F%94%A5-272727.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://flame-engine.org)\n\n```txt\n[![Powered by Flame](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-%F0%9F%94%A5-orange.svg)](https://flame-engine.org)\n[![Powered by Flame](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-%F0%9F%94%A5-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](https://flame-engine.org)\n[![Powered by Flame](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-%F0%9F%94%A5-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://flame-engine.org)\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nHave you found a bug or have a suggestion of how to enhance Flame?
