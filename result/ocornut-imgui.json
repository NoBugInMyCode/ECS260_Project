It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained (no external dependencies).\n\nDear ImGui is designed to **enable fast iterations** and to **empower programmers** to create **content creation tools and visualization / debug tools** (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal and lacks certain features commonly found in more high-level libraries. Among other things, full internationalization (right-to-left text, bidirectional text, text shaping etc.) and accessibility features are not supported.\n\nDear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in game engines (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on console platforms where operating system features are non-standard.\n\n - Minimize state synchronization.\n - Minimize UI-related state storage on user side.\n - Minimize setup and maintenance.\n - Easy to use to create dynamic UI which are the reflection of a dynamic data set.\n - Easy to use to create code-driven and data-driven tools.\n - Easy to use to create ad hoc short-lived tools and long-lived, more elaborate tools.\n - Easy to hack and improve.\n - Portable, minimize dependencies, run on target (consoles, phones, etc.).\n - Efficient runtime and memory consumption.\n - Battle-tested, used by [many major actors in the game industry](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Software-using-dear-imgui).\n\n### Usage\n\n**The core of Dear ImGui is self-contained within a few platform-agnostic files** which you can easily compile in your application/engine. They are all the files in the root folder of the repository (imgui*.cpp, imgui*.h). **No specific build process is required**. You can add the .cpp files into your existing project.\n\n**Backends for a variety of graphics API and rendering platforms** are provided in the [backends/](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/backends) folder, along with example applications in the [examples/](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples) folder. You may also create your own backend. Anywhere where you can render textured triangles, you can render Dear ImGui.\n\nSee the [Getting Started & Integration](#getting-started--integration) section of this document for more details.\n\nAfter Dear ImGui is set up in your application, you can use it from \\_anywhere\\_ in your program loop:\n```cpp\nImGui::Text(\"Hello, world %d\", 123);\nif (ImGui::Button(\"Save\"))\n    MySaveFunction();\nImGui::InputText(\"string\", buf, IM_ARRAYSIZE(buf));\nImGui::SliderFloat(\"float\", &f, 0.0f, 1.0f);\n```\n![sample code output (dark, segoeui font, freetype)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/191050833-b7ecf528-bfae-4a9f-ac1b-f3d83437a2f4.png)\n![sample code output (light, segoeui font, freetype)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/191050838-8742efd4-504d-4334-a9a2-e756d15bc2ab.png)\n\n```cpp\n// Create a window called \"My First Tool\", with a menu bar.\nImGui::Begin(\"My First Tool\", &my_tool_active, ImGuiWindowFlags_MenuBar);\nif (ImGui::BeginMenuBar())\n{\n    if (ImGui::BeginMenu(\"File\"))\n    {\n        if (ImGui::MenuItem(\"Open..\", \"Ctrl+O\")) { /* Do stuff */ }\n        if (ImGui::MenuItem(\"Save\", \"Ctrl+S\"))   { /* Do stuff */ }\n        if (ImGui::MenuItem(\"Close\", \"Ctrl+W\"))  { my_tool_active = false; }\n        ImGui::EndMenu();\n    }\n    ImGui::EndMenuBar();\n}\n\n// Edit a color stored as 4 floats\nImGui::ColorEdit4(\"Color\", my_color);\n\n// Generate samples and plot them\nfloat samples[100];\nfor (int n = 0; n < 100; n++)\n    samples[n] = sinf(n * 0.2f + ImGui::GetTime() * 1.5f);\nImGui::PlotLines(\"Samples\", samples, 100);\n\n// Display contents in a scrolling region\nImGui::TextColored(ImVec4(1,1,0,1), \"Important Stuff\");\nImGui::BeginChild(\"Scrolling\");\nfor (int n = 0; n < 50; n++)\n    ImGui::Text(\"%04d: Some text\", n);\nImGui::EndChild();\nImGui::End();\n```\n![my_first_tool_v188](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/191055698-690a5651-458f-4856-b5a9-e8cc95c543e2.gif)\n\nDear ImGui allows you to **create elaborate tools** as well as very short-lived ones. On the extreme side of short-livedness: using the Edit&Continue (hot code reload) feature of modern compilers you can add a few widgets to tweak variables while your application is running, and remove the code a minute later! Dear ImGui is not just for tweaking values. You can use it to trace a running algorithm by just emitting text commands. You can use it along with your own reflection data to browse your dataset live. You can use it to expose the internals of a subsystem in your engine, to create a logger, an inspection tool, a profiler, a debugger, an entire game-making editor/framework, etc.\n\n### How it works\n\nThe IMGUI paradigm through its API tries to minimize superfluous state duplication, state synchronization, and state retention from the user's point of view. It is less error-prone (less code and fewer bugs) than traditional retained-mode interfaces, and lends itself to creating dynamic user interfaces. Check out the Wiki's [About the IMGUI paradigm](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki#about-the-imgui-paradigm) section for more details.\n\nDear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and command lists that you can easily render in your application. The number of draw calls and state changes required to render them is fairly small. Because Dear ImGui doesn't know or touch graphics state directly, you can call its functions  anywhere in your code (e.g. in the middle of a running algorithm, or in the middle of your own rendering process). Refer to the sample applications in the examples/ folder for instructions on how to integrate Dear ImGui with your existing codebase.\n\n_A common misunderstanding is to mistake immediate mode GUI for immediate mode rendering, which usually implies hammering your driver/GPU with a bunch of inefficient draw calls and state changes as the GUI functions are called. This is NOT what Dear ImGui does. Dear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and a small list of draw calls batches. It never touches your GPU directly. The draw call batches are decently optimal and you can render them later, in your app or even remotely._\n\n### Releases & Changelogs\n\nSee [Releases](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases) page for decorated Changelogs.\nReading the changelogs is a good way to keep up to date with the things Dear ImGui has to offer, and maybe will give you ideas of some features that you've been ignoring until now!\n\n### Demo\n\nCalling the `ImGui::ShowDemoWindow()` function will create a demo window showcasing a variety of features and examples. The code is always available for reference in `imgui_demo.cpp`. [Here's how the demo looks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ocornut/imgui/web/v167/v167-misc.png).\n\nYou should be able to build the examples from sources. If you don't, let us know! If you want to have a quick look at some Dear ImGui features, you can download Windows binaries of the demo app here:\n- [imgui-demo-binaries-20241211.zip](https://www.dearimgui.com/binaries/imgui-demo-binaries-20241211.zip) (Windows, 1.91.6, built 2024/11/11, master) or [older binaries](https://www.dearimgui.com/binaries).\n\nThe demo applications are not DPI aware so expect some blurriness on a 4K screen. For DPI awareness in your application, you can load/reload your font at a different scale and scale your style with `style.ScaleAllSizes()` (see [FAQ](https://www.dearimgui.com/faq)).\n\n### Getting Started & Integration\n\nSee the [Getting Started](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started) guide for details.\n\nOn most platforms and when using C++, **you should be able to use a combination of the [imgui_impl_xxxx](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/backends) backends without modification** (e.g. `imgui_impl_win32.cpp` + `imgui_impl_dx11.cpp`). If your engine supports multiple platforms, consider using more imgui_impl_xxxx files instead of rewriting them: this will be less work for you, and you can get Dear ImGui running immediately. You can _later_ decide to rewrite a custom backend using your custom engine functions if you wish so.\n\nIntegrating Dear ImGui within your custom engine is a matter of 1) wiring mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs 2) uploading a texture to your GPU/render engine 3) providing a render function that can bind textures and render textured triangles, which is essentially what Backends are doing. The [examples/](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples) folder is populated with applications doing just that: setting up a window and using backends. If you follow the [Getting Started](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started) guide it should in theory takes you less than an hour to integrate Dear ImGui.  **Make sure to spend time reading the [FAQ](https://www.dearimgui.com/faq), comments, and the examples applications!**\n\nOfficially maintained backends/bindings (in repository):\n- Renderers: DirectX9, DirectX10, DirectX11, DirectX12, Metal, OpenGL/ES/ES2, SDL_GPU, SDL_Renderer2/3, Vulkan, WebGPU.\n- Platforms: GLFW, SDL2/SDL3, Win32, Glut, OSX, Android.\n- Frameworks: Allegro5, Emscripten.\n\n[Third-party backends/bindings](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Bindings) wiki page:\n- Languages: C, C# and: Beef, ChaiScript, CovScript, Crystal, D, Go, Haskell, Haxe/hxcpp, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Kotlin, Lobster, Lua, Nim, Odin, Pascal, PureBasic, Python, ReaScript, Ruby, Rust, Swift, Zig...\n- Frameworks: AGS/Adventure Game Studio, Amethyst, Blender, bsf, Cinder, Cocos2d-x, Defold, Diligent Engine, Ebiten, Flexium, GML/Game Maker Studio, GLEQ, Godot, GTK3, Irrlicht Engine, JUCE, L\u00d6VE+LUA, Mach Engine, Magnum, Marmalade, Monogame, NanoRT, nCine, Nim Game Lib, Nintendo 3DS/Switch/WiiU (homebrew), Ogre, openFrameworks, OSG/OpenSceneGraph, Orx, Photoshop, px_render, Qt/QtDirect3D, raylib, SFML, Sokol, Unity, Unreal Engine 4/5, UWP, vtk, VulkanHpp, VulkanSceneGraph, Win32 GDI, WxWidgets.\n- Many bindings are auto-generated (by good old [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui) or newer/experimental [dear_bindings](https://github.com/dearimgui/dear_bindings)), you can use their metadata output to generate bindings for other languages.\n\n[Useful Extensions/Widgets](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Useful-Extensions) wiki page:\n- Automation/testing, Text editors, node editors, timeline editors, plotting, software renderers, remote network access, memory editors, gizmos, etc. Notable and well supported extensions include [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) and [Dear ImGui Test Engine](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine).\n\nAlso see [Wiki](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki) for more links and ideas.\n\n### Gallery\n\nExamples projects using Dear ImGui: [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) (profiler), [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex) (hex editor/data analysis), [RemedyBG](https://remedybg.itch.io/remedybg) (debugger) and [hundreds of others](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Software-using-Dear-ImGui).\n\nFor more user-submitted screenshots of projects using Dear ImGui, check out the [Gallery Threads](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues?q=label%3Agallery)!\n\nFor a list of third-party widgets and extensions, check out the [Useful Extensions/Widgets](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Useful-Extensions) wiki page.\n\n|  |  |\n|--|--|\n| Custom engine [erhe](https://github.com/tksuoran/erhe) (docking branch)<BR>[![erhe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/190203358-6988b846-0686-480e-8663-1311fbd18abd.jpg)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/994606/147875067-a848991e-2ad2-4fd3-bf71-4aeb8a547bcf.png) | Custom engine for [Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap](http://www.TheDragonsTrap.com) (2017)<BR>[![the dragon's trap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/190203379-57fcb80e-4aec-4fec-959e-17ddd3cd71e5.jpg)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8225057/20628927/33e14cac-b329-11e6-80f6-9524e93b048a.png) |\n| Custom engine (untitled)<BR>[![editor white](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/190203393-c5ac9f22-b900-4d1e-bfeb-6027c63e3d92.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ocornut/imgui/web/v160/editor_white.png) | Tracy Profiler ([github](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy))<BR>[![tracy profiler](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/190203401-7b595f6e-607c-44d3-97ea-4c2673244dfb.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ocornut/imgui/web/v176/tracy_profiler.png) |\n\n### Support, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nSee: [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md) where common questions are answered.\n\nSee: [Getting Started](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started) and [Wiki](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki) for many links, references, articles.\n\nSee: [Articles about the IMGUI paradigm](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki#about-the-imgui-paradigm) to read/learn about the Immediate Mode GUI paradigm.\n\nSee: [Upcoming Changes](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Upcoming-Changes).\n\nSee: [Dear ImGui Test Engine + Test Suite](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine) for Automation & Testing.\n\nFor the purposes of getting search engines to crawl the wiki, here's a link to the [Crawlable Wiki](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/ocornut/imgui/wiki) (not for humans, [here's why](https://github-wiki-see.page/)).\n\nGetting started?
