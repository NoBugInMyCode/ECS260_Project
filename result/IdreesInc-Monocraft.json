This font emulates the typeface of the font used in the Minecraft UI, but it does not include any assets or font files from the original game.*\n\n## Features\n\n- Minecraft!\n  - The characters in this font were based around the [typeface](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font) used in the Minecraft UI, with each glyph updated for better readability and spacing\n- Monospaced!\n  - Each of the 1500+ glyphs included in this font have been carefully redesigned to work in a monospaced font\n  - Thin characters like \"i\" and \"l\" have been reworked with tasteful tails and serifs to look better in a monospaced environment\n- Programming ligatures!\n  - Add some spice to your programming life with all new ligature characters\n  - Arrows now look like arrows and comparison operators are easier to see at a glance\n\n## Glyphs\n\n![](images/glyphs.png)\n\n## How to install\n\n### Windows\n\nDownload the most recent `Monocraft.ttc` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/releases) page. Right click on the downloaded font and select **Install**. You might need administrative access to install fonts, depending on your machine.\n\n### Mac\n\n#### Using Homebrew\n\n```shell\nbrew tap homebrew/cask-fonts\nbrew install --cask font-monocraft\n```\n\n#### Manually\n\nDownload the most recent `Monocraft.ttc` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/releases) page. Double click on the downloaded font file and select **Install Font** in the window that appears. More help available [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749).\n\n### Linux\n\nDownload the most recent `Monocraft.ttc` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/releases) page. Move the file to ~/.local/share/fonts (create the folder if it doesn't already exist). In a terminal, run `fc-cache -fv`. Alternatively, log out and log in again. \n\n## How to use\n\nAfter following the installation instructions up above, simply select the \"Monocraft\" font (note the space) in any application that supports custom fonts. You might need to restart the application or your computer for the font to appear.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What ligatures are available?\n\nSo far, the following ligatures have been added to the font:\n\n<img src=\"images/ligatures.png\" width=\"300\">\n\nAnd with the contributions of [@Ciubix8513](https://github.com/Ciubix8513), Monocraft now includes continuous ligatures that enable you to type arrows and lines that _just keep going_.\n\nIf there is another character combination that you feel could be a ligature, feel free to create an issue!\n\n### How are these characters generated?\n\nUsing [FontForge's](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) excellent Python extension, the glyphs are created from configuration files representing each character's pixels. Diacritics are created separately and are combined with the original characters to create over 500 unique glyphs. To learn more, check out the source code in the [src](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/tree/main/src) folder.\n\n### Do you have a version with the original Minecraft font (not monospaced)?\n\nI've got you covered, check out my rendition of the Minecraft typeface [here](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font).\n\n### What if I want to use a font that's actually good?\n\nUnderstandable, check out [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for a font with amazing attention to detail, or [Scientifica](https://github.com/nerdypepper/scientifica) for a bitmap font similar to this. Feel free to also check out my font [Miracode](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Miracode) for a font based on Monocraft that's a little more usable!",
