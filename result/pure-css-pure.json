To do this, you'll\nneed to have Node.js and npm installed. We use [Grunt][] to build Pure.\n\n```shell\ngit clone git@github.com:pure-css/pure.git\ncd pure\nnpm install\ngrunt\n```\n\n### Build Files\n\nNow, all Pure CSS files should be built into the `pure/build/` directory. All\nfiles that are in this build directory are also available on the CDN. The naming\nconventions of the files in the `build/` directory follow these rules:\n\n- `[module]-core.css`: The minimal set of styles, usually structural, that\n  provide the base on which the rest of the module's styles build.\n\n- `[module]-nr.css`: Rollup of `[module]-core.css` + `[module].css` +\n  `[module]-[feature].css` from the `src/[module]/` dir. This is the\n  non-responsive version of a module.\n\n- `[module].css`: Rollup of `[module]-nr.css` + `[module]-r.css` from the\n  `build/` dir. This is the responsive version of a module.\n\n- `*-min.css`: A minified file version of the files of the same name.\n\n- `pure.css`: A rollup of all `[module].css` files in the `build/` dir. This is\n  a responsive roll-up of everything, non-minified. Note: does not contain responsive grids with @media queries.\n\n- `pure-min.css`: Minified version of `pure.css` that should be used in\n  production.\n\n- `pure-nr.css`: A Rollup of all modules without @media queries. This is a\n  non-responsive roll-up of everything, non-minified.\n\n- `pure-nr-min.css`: Minified version of `pure-nr.css` that should be used in\n  production.\n\n- `grids-responsive.css`: Unminified version of Pure's grid stylesheet which\n  includes @media queries.\n\n- `grids-responsive-min.css`: Minified version of `grids-responsive.css` that\n  should be used in production.\n\n## Browser Support and Testing\n\nPure is tested and works in:\n\n- Latest Stable: Firefox, Chrome, Safari\n\n## Docs and Website\n\n[Pure's website][pure] is located in the [`site`][pure-site] directory. Please feel free\nto open issues or questions in the Issue tab.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [CONTRIBUTING file][] for information on how to contribute to Pure.\n\n## License\n\nThis software is free to use under the Yahoo!
