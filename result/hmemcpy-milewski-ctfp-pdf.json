See\n    [errata-1.3.0](errata-1.3.0.md) for changes and fixes since print.\n- **[Scala Edition in paperback][buy scala edition on blurb]**\n  - Publish date: 12 August, 2019.\n  - Based off release tag [v1.3.0][v1.3.0 github release link]. See\n    [errata-scala](errata-scala.md) for changes and fixes since print.\n\n## Build the book\n\nThe building workflow requires [Nix][nix website]. After [installing\nNix][nix download website], you need to enable the upcoming \"flake\" feature\nwhich must be [enabled manually][nixos wiki flake] the time being. This is\nneeded to expose the new Nix commands and flakes support that are hidden behind\nfeature-flags.\n\nAfterwards, type `nix flake show` in the root directory of the project to see\nall the available versions of this book. Then type `nix build .#<edition>` to\nbuild the edition you want (Scala, OCaml, Reason and their printed versions).\nFor example, to build the Scala edition you'll have to type\n`nix build .#ctfp-scala`. For Haskell (the original version) that is just\n`nix build .#ctfp`.\n\nUpon successful compilation, the PDF file will be placed in the `result`\ndirectory.\n\nThe command `nix develop` will provide a shell containing all the required\ndependencies to build the book manually using the provided `Makefile`. To build\nthe `ctfp-scala` edition, just run `make ctfp-scala`.\n\n## Contribute\n\nContributors are welcome to contribute to this book by sending pull-requests.\nOnce reviewed, the changes are merged in the main branch and will be\nincorporated in the next release.\n\n**Note from [Bartosz][bartosz github]**: I really appreciate all your\ncontributions. You made this book much better than I could have imagined. Thank\nyou!\n\nFind the [list of contributors on Github][contributors].\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nPDF LaTeX source and the tools to create it are based on the work by [Andres\nRaba][andres raba github].
