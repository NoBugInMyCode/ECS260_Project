All our client apps (macOS,\nWindows, Linux, iOS, and Android) are being actively developed in this\nrepository. Please, dig around.\n\n### Warnings\n\nWe'd love you to read our source code.\n\nBut - some of the things in this repo are explorations, and the app you build\nfrom source just _might not do what it says it's doing_. So, if you just want\nto install Keybase on your computer, you should **[monitor our releases](https://keybase.io/download)** for macOS, Linux, or Windows.\n\nIf you're interested in our Docker image releases, please check out **[the Docker README](packaging/linux/docker/README.md)**.\n\n![Sharing](https://keybase.io/images/github/repo_share.png?)\n\n### Code Layout\n\n- **go**: Core crypto libraries; the Keybase service; the command line client. [Learn More](go/README.md)\n- **shared/{android,ios}**: Android and iOS apps developed with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).\n- **shared/desktop**: Desktop application for macOS, Linux, and Windows, made with the [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) framework, sharing React code with react-native.\n- **packaging**: Scripts for releasing packages across the various platforms.\n- **protocol**: Defines the protocol for communication for clients to the Keybase services. Uses [Avro](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.7/). [Learn More](protocol/README.md)\n- **media**: Icons, graphics, media for Keybase apps.\n- **osx**: The macOS Keybase.app, development parallel to an Electron-based application above. [Learn More](osx/README.md)\n\n### Problems?\n\nReport any issues with client software on this GitHub\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/keybase/client/issues).\nInternally, we track our progress using Jira, but all PRs come through GitHub\nfor your review!\n\nIf you're having problems with the command line `keybase` client, take a\nlook at [the troubleshooting doc](go/doc/troubleshooting.md).\n\nIf you're having problems with our Website, try the\n[keybase-issues](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues) issue tracker.\n\nWe check and update both frequently.\n\n### License\n\nMost code is released under the New BSD (3 Clause) License. If subdirectories\ninclude a different license, that license applies instead.\n\n### Development Guidelines\n\nWe check all git commits with pre-commit hooks generated via\n[pre-commit.com](http://pre-commit.com) pre-commit hooks.\nTo enable use of these pre-commit hooks:\n\n- [Install](http://pre-commit.com/#install) the `pre-commit` utility. For some common cases:\n  - `pip install pre-commit`\n  - `brew install pre-commit`\n- Remove any existing pre-commit hooks via `rm .git/hooks/pre-commit`\n- Configure via `pre-commit install`\n\nThen proceed as normal.\n\n#### External Contributors\n\nIf you forked this repository on GitHub and made a PR, then it'll show up as\nhaving failed Jenkins CI. We do not build external PRs because it's a security\nrisk to do so without a review first. If your PR is successfully reviewed by a\nmember of the Keybase team, then we will merge your commits to a branch on our\nprimary fork and build from there.\n\n### Cryptography Notice\n\nThis distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you\ncurrently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or\nre-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any\nencryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and policies\nconcerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption\nsoftware, to see if this is permitted. See http://www.wassenaar.org/ for more\ninformation.\n\nThe U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security\n(BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN)\n5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using or performing\ncryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of this\ndistribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception ENC\nTechnology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS Export\nAdministration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object code and source\ncode.\n",
