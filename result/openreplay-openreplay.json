It also shows you what went under the hood, how your website or app behaves by capturing network activity, console logs, JS errors, store actions/state, page speed metrics, cpu/memory usage and much more.\n- **Low footprint**. With a ~26KB (.br) tracker that asynchronously sends minimal data for a very limited impact on performance.\n- **Self-hosted**. No more security compliance checks, 3rd-parties processing user data. Everything OpenReplay captures stays in your cloud for a complete control over your data.\n- **Privacy controls**. Fine-grained security features for sanitizing user data.\n- **Easy deploy**. With support of major public cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean).\n\n## Features\n\n- **Session replay:** Lets you relive your users' experience, see where they struggle and how it affects their behavior. Each session replay is automatically analyzed based on heuristics, for easy triage.\n- **Spot:** A Chrome extension that lets record bugs directly from your browser \u2014 each recording includes all the technical details developers need to fix them.\n- **DevTools:** It's like debugging in your own browser. OpenReplay provides you with the full context (network activity, JS errors, store actions/state and 40+ metrics) so you can instantly reproduce bugs and understand performance issues.\n- **Assist:** Helps you support your users by seeing their live screen and instantly hopping on call (WebRTC) with them without requiring any 3rd-party screen sharing software.\n- **Omni-search:** Search and filter by almost any user action/criteria, session attribute or technical event, so you can answer any question. No instrumentation required.\n- **Analytics:** For surfacing the most impactful issues causing conversion and revenue loss.\n- **Fine-grained privacy controls:** Choose what to capture, what to obscure or what to ignore so user data doesn't even reach your servers.\n- **Plugins oriented:** Get to the root cause even faster by tracking application state (Redux, VueX, MobX, NgRx, Pinia and Zustand) and logging GraphQL queries (Apollo, Relay) and Fetch/Axios requests.\n- **Integrations:** Sync your backend logs with your session replays and see what happened front-to-back. OpenReplay supports Sentry, Datadog, CloudWatch, Stackdriver, Elastic and more.\n\n## Deployment Options\n\nOpenReplay can be deployed anywhere.
