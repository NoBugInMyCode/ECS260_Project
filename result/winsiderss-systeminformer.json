Brought to you by Winsider Seminars & Solutions, Inc.\n\n[Project Website](https://systeminformer.sourceforge.io/) - [Project Downloads](https://systeminformer.sourceforge.io/downloads.php)\n\n## System requirements\n\nWindows 10 or higher, 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\n## Features\n\n* A detailed overview of system activity with highlighting.\n* Graphs and statistics allow you quickly to track down resource hogs and runaway processes.\n* Can't edit or delete a file? Discover which processes are using that file.\n* See what programs have active network connections, and close them if necessary.\n* Get real-time information on disk access.\n* View detailed stack traces with kernel-mode, WOW64 and .NET support.\n* Go beyond services.msc: create, edit and control services.\n* Small, portable and no installation required.\n* 100% [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) ([MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))\n\n\n## Building the project\n\nRequires Visual Studio (2022 or later).\n\nAfter cloning the repo run `build_init.cmd` located in the `build` directory, this doesn't not run again unless there are updates to the tools or third party libraries.\n\nExecute `build_release.cmd` located in the `build` directory to compile the project or load the `SystemInformer.sln` and `Plugins.sln` solutions if you prefer building the project using Visual Studio.\n\nYou can download the free [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) to build the System Informer source code.\n\nSee the [build readme](./build/README.md) for more information or if you're having trouble building.\n\n## Enhancements/Bugs\n\n\nPlease use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/winsiderss/systeminformer/issues)\nfor reporting problems or suggesting new features.\n\n\n## Settings\n\nIf you are running System Informer from a USB drive, you may want to\nsave System Informer's settings there as well. To do this, create a\nblank file named \"SystemInformer.exe.settings.xml\" in the same\ndirectory as SystemInformer.exe. You can do this using Windows Explorer:\n\n1. Make sure \"Hide extensions for known file types\" is unticked in\n   Tools > Folder options > View.\n2. Right-click in the folder and choose New > Text Document.\n3. Rename the file to SystemInformer.exe.settings.xml (delete the \".txt\"\n   extension).\n\n## Plugins\n\nPlugins can be configured from Options > Plugins.\n\nIf you experience any crashes involving plugins, make sure they\nare up to date.\n\nDisk and Network information provided by the ExtendedTools plugin is\nonly available when running System Informer with administrative\nrights.\n",
