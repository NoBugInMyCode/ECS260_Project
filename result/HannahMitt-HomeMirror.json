Clone project\n2. Get a [forecast.io api key](https://developer.forecast.io/)\n3. Add a keys.xml file under res/values with \\<string name=\"dark_sky_api_key\">your_key\\</string>\n4. Import project to Android Studio and run\n\nWhen its mirror time, I also recommend turning on the device Developer Option: \"Stay Awake - Screen will never sleep while charging\"\n\nMaking a Mirror\n====\n\n[Video walk-through on adafruit (Thank you Becky!)](https://learn.adafruit.com/android-smart-home-mirror)\n\n1. Obtain Android device\n----\nWe had too many. Sad old devices are ideal.\nI used a [2012 Nexus 7](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B009X3UW2G/ref=olp_tab_refurbished?ie=UTF8&condition=refurbished&qid=1441327955&sr=8-1).\n\n2. Obtain two-way mirror\n---\nWe did this the old-fashioned way, and quested to [Canal Plastic Center](http://canalplastic.com/). A beautiful and highly recommended establishment. \n\n[Wiki of places to buy two-way mirrors](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror/wiki/Places-to-buy-a-two-way-mirror)\n\nGet a mirror at least as large as your Android device. My mirror is 6\"x12\" with 1/8 thickness. \n\n3. Sticky stuff for mounting\n---\nOur trickiest problem was figuring out how to mount everything with minimal damage and error.\nWe eventually discovered [reusable double-sided adhesive](http://www.amazon.com/Command-Assorted-8-Small-4-Medium-4-Large/dp/B0084M68IO/ref=pd_sim_sbs_229_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=1TX12CR5RF0RTP6CKJR7&dpSrc=sims&dpST=_AC_UL320_SR202%2C320_), which is amazing. \n\nWe're using it both to mount the mirror to the device, and the device to the wall.\n\n4. Attach black backing\n---\nWe used black construction paper. If your device and mirror are awesomely identical in size, you can skip this.\n\nNote: You want to glue it well, so the backing doesn't tear when the adhesive is holding it.\n\n* Cut a piece of black backing the same size as your mirror\n* Decide where you want your device to show through. We did upper right. Leave a border all the way around for adhesive.\n* At that location, carefully cut a hole in the backing the same size as your device\n* CAREFULLY glue the backing to the mirror. We used spray adhesive, and practiced how we would pick it up and lay it on the mirror a couple times before going for it. We also wore black surgical gloves.\n \n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror/master/design/IMG_20150911_110449-2.jpg\" height=\"400\"/>\n\n5. Adhesion\n---\nFire up the app on the device.\n\nPut the adhesive along the bezel or edges of the device. Line up the mirror and stick it on there.\n\n6. Wall spot\n---\nYou probably want a long usb cable. Find a wall spot where you can keep the device plugged in.\n\nPut a bunch of adhesive on the back of the device, and stick it on there.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror/faed8d927b93ec2c38159d8e3968f8133511ee67/design/thumbs_up_mirror.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n\nLinks\n===\nAt the heart of this project, is 'put a mirror on it'.
