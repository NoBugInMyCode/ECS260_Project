Quite well, actually - on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Bear in mind that this is written entirely in JavaScript, so please adjust your expectations.\n\n## Should this have been a native app?\nAbsolutely.\n\n## Does it run Doom (or my other favorite game)?\nYou'll likely be better off with an actual virtualization app, but the short answer is yes. [Thanks to\n@DisplacedGamers](https://youtu.be/xDXqmdFxofM) I can recommend that you switch to a resolution of\n640x480 @ 256 colors before starting DOS games - just like in the good ol' days.\n\n## Credits\n\n99% of the work was done over at [v86](https://github.com/copy/v86/) by Copy aka Fabian Hemmer and his contributors.\n\n## Contributing\n\nBefore you can run this from source, you'll need the disk image. It's not part of the\nrepository, but you can grab it using the `Show Disk Image` button from the packaged\nrelease, which does include the disk image. You can find that button in the\n`Modify C: Drive` section.\n\nUnpack the `images` folder into the `src` folder, creating this layout:\n\n```\n- /images/windows95.img\n- /images/default-state.bin\n- /assets/...\n- /bios/...\n- /docs/...\n```\n\nOnce you've done so, run `npm install` and `npm start` to run your local build.\n\nIf you want to tinker with the image or make a new one, check out the [QEMU docs](./docs/qemu.md).\n\n## Other Questions\n\n * [MS-DOS seems to brick the screen](./HELP.md#ms-dos-seems-to-brick-the-screen)\n * [Windows 95 is stuck in a bad state](./HELP.md#windows-95-is-stuck-in-a-bad-state)\n * [I want to install additional apps or games](./HELP.md#i-want-to-install-additional-apps-or-games)\n * [Running in Docker](./docs/docker-instructions.md)\n * [Running in an online VM with Kubernetes and Gitpod](./docs/docker-kubernetes-gitpod.md)\n\n## License\n\nThis project is provided for educational purposes only.
