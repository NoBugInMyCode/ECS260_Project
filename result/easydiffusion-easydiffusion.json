If you face any problems, you can join the friendly [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/u9yhsFmEkB) and ask for assistance.\n\n## On Windows:\n1. Run the downloaded `Easy-Diffusion-Windows.exe` file.\n2. Run `Easy Diffusion` once the installation finishes. You can also start from your Start Menu, or from your desktop (if you created a shortcut).\n\nIf Windows SmartScreen prevents you from running the program click `More info` and then `Run anyway`.\n\n**Tip:** On Windows 10, please install at the top level in your drive, e.g. `C:\\EasyDiffusion` or `D:\\EasyDiffusion`. This will avoid a common problem with Windows 10 (file path length limits).\n\n## On Linux/Mac:\n1. Unzip/extract the folder `easy-diffusion` which should be in your downloads folder, unless you changed your default downloads destination.\n2. Open a terminal window, and navigate to the `easy-diffusion` directory.\n3. Run `./start.sh` (or `bash start.sh`) in a terminal.\n\n# To remove/uninstall:\nJust delete the `EasyDiffusion` folder to uninstall all the downloaded packages.\n\n----\n\n# Easy for new users, powerful features for advanced users\n## Features:\n\n### User experience\n- **Hassle-free installation**: Does not require technical knowledge, does not require pre-installed software. Just download and run!\n- **Clutter-free UI**: A friendly and simple UI, while providing a lot of powerful features.\n- **Task Queue**: Queue up all your ideas, without waiting for the current task to finish.\n- **Intelligent Model Detection**: Automatically figures out the YAML config file to use for the chosen model (via a models database).\n- **Live Preview**: See the image as the AI is drawing it.\n- **Image Modifiers**: A library of *modifier tags* like *\"Realistic\"*, *\"Pencil Sketch\"*, *\"ArtStation\"* etc. Experiment with various styles quickly.\n- **Multiple Prompts File**: Queue multiple prompts by entering one prompt per line, or by running a text file.\n- **Save generated images to disk**: Save your images to your PC!\n- **UI Themes**: Customize the program to your liking.\n- **Searchable models dropdown**: organize your models into sub-folders, and search through them in the UI.\n\n### Powerful image generation\n- **Supports**: \"*Text to Image*\", \"*Image to Image*\" and \"*InPainting*\"\n- **ControlNet**: For advanced control over the image, e.g. by setting the pose or drawing the outline for the AI to fill in.\n- **16 Samplers**: `PLMS`, `DDIM`, `DEIS`, `Heun`, `Euler`, `Euler Ancestral`, `DPM2`, `DPM2 Ancestral`, `LMS`, `DPM Solver`, `DPM++ 2s Ancestral`, `DPM++ 2m`, `DPM++ 2m SDE`, `DPM++ SDE`, `DDPM`, `UniPC`.\n- **Stable Diffusion XL and 2.1**: Generate higher-quality images using the latest Stable Diffusion XL models.\n- **Textual Inversion Embeddings**: For guiding the AI strongly towards a particular concept.\n- **Simple Drawing Tool**: Draw basic images to guide the AI, without needing an external drawing program.\n- **Face Correction (GFPGAN)**\n- **Upscaling (RealESRGAN)**\n- **Loopback**: Use the output image as the input image for the next image task.\n- **Negative Prompt**: Specify aspects of the image to *remove*.\n- **Attention/Emphasis**: `+` in the prompt increases the model's attention to enclosed words, and `-` decreases it. E.g. `apple++ falling from a tree`.\n- **Weighted Prompts**: Use weights for specific words in your prompt to change their importance, e.g. `(red)2.4 (dragon)1.2`.\n- **Prompt Matrix**: Quickly create multiple variations of your prompt, e.g. `a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse | illustration | cinematic lighting`.\n- **Prompt Set**: Quickly create multiple variations of your prompt, e.g. `a photograph of an astronaut on the {moon,earth}`\n- **1-click Upscale/Face Correction**: Upscale or correct an image after it has been generated.\n- **Make Similar Images**: Click to generate multiple variations of a generated image.\n- **NSFW Setting**: A setting in the UI to control *NSFW content*.\n- **JPEG/PNG/WEBP output**: Multiple file formats.\n\n### Advanced features\n- **Custom Models**: Use your own `.ckpt` or `.safetensors` file, by placing it inside the `models/stable-diffusion` folder!\n- **Stable Diffusion XL and 2.1 support**\n- **Merge Models**\n- **Use custom VAE models**\n- **Textual Inversion Embeddings**\n- **ControlNet**\n- **Use custom GFPGAN models**\n- **UI Plugins**: Choose from a growing list of [community-generated UI plugins](https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion/wiki/UI-Plugins), or write your own plugin to add features to the project!\n\n### Performance and security\n- **Fast**: Creates a 512x512 image with euler_a in 5 seconds, on an NVIDIA 3060 12GB.\n- **Low Memory Usage**: Create 512x512 images with less than 2 GB of GPU RAM, and 768x768 images with less than 3 GB of GPU RAM!\n- **Use CPU setting**: If you don't have a compatible graphics card, but still want to run it on your CPU.\n- **Multi-GPU support**: Automatically spreads your tasks across multiple GPUs (if available), for faster performance!\n- **Auto scan for malicious models**: Uses picklescan to prevent malicious models.\n- **Safetensors support**: Support loading models in the safetensor format, for improved safety.\n- **Auto-updater**: Gets you the latest improvements and bug-fixes to a rapidly evolving project.\n- **Developer Console**: A developer-mode for those who want to modify their Stable Diffusion code, modify packages, and edit the conda environment.\n\n**(and a lot more)**\n\n----\n\n## Easy for new users, powerful features for advanced users:\n![image](https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion/assets/844287/efbbac9f-42ce-4aef-8625-fd23c74a8241)\n\n## Task Queue\n![Screenshot of task queue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/844287/217043984-0b35f73b-1318-47cb-9eed-a2a91b430490.png)\n\n\n----\n\n# How to use?\nPlease refer to our [guide](https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion/wiki/How-to-Use) to understand how to use the features in this UI.\n\n# Bugs reports and code contributions welcome\nIf there are any problems or suggestions, please feel free to ask on the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/u9yhsFmEkB) or [file an issue](https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion/issues).\n\nIf you have any code contributions in mind, please feel free to say Hi to us on the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/u9yhsFmEkB).
