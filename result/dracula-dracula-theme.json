Since you're already using app X you're probably much more experienced in it than us. So give it a try first!\n\n###### \"How do I submit a new theme?\"\n\n1. Create a new repository based on this [template](https://github.com/dracula/template).\n2. Build the new theme using the [Color Palette](#color-palette) above.\n3. Finally, [submit an issue](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/issues/new) with a link to your repository. Once the theme is accepted, we will move the repository under the Dracula organization and give you rights to maintain it \ud83d\ude00\n\n## Accessibility [![W3C](https://img.shields.io/badge/WCAG_2.1_|_AA-B695F3?logo=w3c&logoColor=fff&style=flat-square)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum)\n\nThe colors maintain a `4.5:1` contrast ratio, complying with [WCAG 2.1 | Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum).\n\n## The Dracula Theme Team\n\nDracula is a project created by [Zeno Rocha](https://github.com/zenorocha/) with the help of many outstanding contributors and maintainers, and each theme has its maintainer listed in the Team section of its `README`.\n\nOn April 13, 2022, [Lucas de Fran\u00e7a](https://github.com/luxonauta) officially joined the team, and you can read more [here](https://draculatheme.com/blog/interview-with-lucas).\n\n| [![Zeno Rocha](https://github.com/zenorocha.png?size=100)](https://github.com/zenorocha) | [![Lucas de Fran\u00e7a](https://github.com/luxonauta.png?size=100)](https://github.com/luxonauta) |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Zeno Rocha](https://github.com/zenorocha)                                               | [Lucas de Fran\u00e7a](https://github.com/luxonauta)                                               |\n\n## Organization\n\nOver the years, Dracula has grown to support many more editors. With that came the challenge of supporting many editors, terminals, shells, and more in the same repository. Some package managers require specific files and layouts, which cause conflicts and make them harder to maintain.\n\nSo, it was decided to change Dracula from a one-repository theme to an organization. All themes have now been migrated to their repository. With this change, we can better support package managers and list maintainers, make installation instructions easier to find, and support independent releases.\n\nSee [Dracula organization](https://github.com/dracula) for all of our repositories.\n\n## Community\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/draculatheme) - Best for getting updates about themes and new stuff.\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/discussions) - Best for asking questions and discussing issues.\n- [Discord](https://draculatheme.com/discord-invite) - Best for hanging out with the community.\n\n## Dracula PRO\n\nDracula PRO is a color scheme and UI theme **tailored for programming**. Made for terminal emulators, **code editors**, and syntax highlighters.\n\nDesigned to be aesthetically pleasing while **keeping you focused**.\n\n[![Dracula PRO](./.github/dracula-pro.png)](https://draculatheme.com/pro)\n\n## Credits\n\n- Color palette inspired by [@chenluois's Mou Night theme](http://mouapp.com/)\n- Sublime Text theme built on top of [Monokai](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#/Monokai-sublime) using [@aziz's tmtheme editor](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/)\n- ZSH theme built on top of [@robbyrussell's theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/robbyrussell.zsh-theme)\n\n## Changelog\n\nThe changelog is available on the release page in each theme's repository.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](./LICENSE) \u00a9 Dracula Theme\n",
