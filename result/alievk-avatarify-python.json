[Avatarify Desktop](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify-desktop), which aims to be easier to install and use, is recommended for most users. If you still want to use Avatarify Python, proceed to the [install instructions](docs/).\n\nBased on [First Order Motion Model](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model).\n\n## News\n- **7 Mar 2021.** Renamed project to Avatarify Python to distinguish it from other versions of Avatarify\n- **14 December 2020.** Released Avatarify Desktop. Check it out [here](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify-desktop).\n- **11 July 2020.** Added Docker support. Now you can run Avatarify from Docker on [Linux](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify-python/blob/master/docs/README.md#docker). Thanks to [mikaelhg](https://github.com/mikaelhg) and [mintmaker](https://github.com/mintmaker) for contribution!\n- **22 May 2020.** Added [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alievk/avatarify/blob/master/avatarify.ipynb) mode. Now you can run Avatarify on any computer without GPU!\n- **7 May 2020.** Added remote GPU support for all platforms (based on [mynameisfiber's](https://github.com/mynameisfiber) solution). [Demo](https://youtu.be/3Dz_bUIPYFM). Deployment [instructions](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify-python/wiki/Remote-GPU). \n- **24 April 2020.** Added Windows installation [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lym9ANVb120).\n- **17 April 2020.** Created Slack community. Please join via [invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/avatarify/shared_invite/zt-dyoqy8tc-~4U2ObQ6WoxuwSaWKKVOgg).\n- **15 April 2020.** Added [StyleGAN-generated](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com) avatars. Just press `Q` and now you drive a person that never existed. Every time you push the button \u2013 new avatar is sampled.\n- **13 April 2020.** Added Windows support (kudos to [9of9](https://github.com/9of9)).\n\n## Avatarify apps\n\nWe have deployed Avatarify on iOS and Android devices using our proprietary inference engine. The iOS version features the Life mode for recording animations in real time. However, the Life mode is not available on Android devices due to the diversity of the devices we have to support.\n\n[<img src=docs/appstore-badge.png alt=\"drawing\" height=\"40\"/>](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1512669147?pt=121960189&ct=GitHub&mt=8)\n[<img src=docs/google-play-badge.png alt=\"drawing\" height=\"40\"/>](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avatarify.android)\n",
