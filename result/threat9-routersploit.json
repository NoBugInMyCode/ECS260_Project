The project is under heavy development and new modules are shipped almost every day.\n\n```\ncd routersploit\ngit pull\n```\n\n# Build your own\nTo our surprise, people started to fork \n[routersploit](https://github.com/threat9/routersploit) not because they were \ninterested in the security of embedded devices but simply because they want to \nleverage our interactive shell logic and build their tools using similar \nconcept. All these years they must have said: _\"There must be a better way!\"_ \nand they were completely right, the better way is called \n[_Riposte_](https://github.com/fwkz/riposte).\n\n[_Riposte_](https://github.com/fwkz/riposte) allows you to easily wrap your \napplication inside a tailored interactive shell. Common chores regarding \nbuilding REPLs was factored out and being taken care of so you can \nfocus on specific domain logic of your application.\n# License\n\nThe RouterSploit Framework is under a BSD license.\nPlease see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n* [riposte](https://github.com/fwkz/riposte)\n",
