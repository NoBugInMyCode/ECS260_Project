Example :\n\n```bash\n$ ghunt email <email_address> --json user_data.json\n```\n\n**Have fun \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc9e**\n\n# \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Developers\n\n\ud83d\udcd5 I started writing some docs [here](https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt/wiki) and examples [here](https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt/tree/master/examples), feel free to contribute !\n\nTo use GHunt as a lib, you can't use pipx because it uses a venv.\\\nSo you should install GHunt with pip :\n```bash\n$ pip3 install ghunt\n```\n\nAnd now, you should be able to `import ghunt` in your projects !\\\nYou can right now play with the [examples](https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt/tree/master/examples).\n\n# \ud83d\udcee Details\n\n## Obvious disclaimer\n\nThis tool is for educational purposes only, I am not responsible for its use.\n\n## Less obvious disclaimer\n\nThis project is under [AGPL Licence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/), and you have to respect it.\\\n**Use it only in personal, criminal investigations, pentesting, or open-source projects.**\n\n## Thanks\n\n- [novitae](https://github.com/novitae) for being my Python colleague\n- All the people on [Malfrats Industries](https://discord.gg/sg2YcrC6x9) and elsewhere for the beta test !\n- The HideAndSec team \ud83d\udc97 (blog : https://hideandsec.sh)\n- [Med Amine Jouini](https://dribbble.com/jouiniamine) for his beautiful rework of the Google logo, which I was inspired by *a lot*.\n\n## Sponsors\n\nThanks to these awesome people for supporting me !\n\n<!-- sponsors --><a href=\"https://github.com/BlWasp\"><img src=\"https://github.com/BlWasp.png\" width=\"50px\" alt=\"BlWasp\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy\"><img src=\"https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy.png\" width=\"50px\" alt=\"C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/gingeleski\"><img src=\"https://github.com/gingeleski.png\" width=\"50px\" alt=\"gingeleski\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- sponsors -->\n\n\\\nYou like my work ?\\\n[Sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/mxrch) on GitHub ! \ud83e\udd17\n",
