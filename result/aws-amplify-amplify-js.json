If you are looking for upgrade guidance [click here](#notice)\n\n### AWS Amplify is a JavaScript library for frontend and mobile developers building cloud-enabled applications\n\nAWS Amplify provides a declarative and easy-to-use interface across different categories of cloud operations. AWS Amplify goes well with any JavaScript based frontend workflow and React Native for mobile developers.\n\nOur default implementation works with Amazon Web Services (AWS), but AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom backend or service.\n\n#### Visit our [documentation site](https://docs.amplify.aws/) to learn more about AWS Amplify. Please see the [Amplify JavaScript](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/q/platform/js/) page for information around the full list of features we support.\n\n-

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-amplify).\n\nTo get started pick your platform from our [**Getting Started** home page](https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/)\n\n## Notice:\n\n### Amplify 6.x.x has breaking changes. Please see the breaking changes on our [migration guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/migrate-from-javascript-v5-to-v6/)\n\n### Amplify 5.x.x has breaking changes. Please see the breaking changes below:\n\n- If you are using **default exports** from any Amplify package, then you will need to migrate to using named exports. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';\n  + import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify'\n\n  - import Analytics from '@aws-amplify/analytics';\n  + import { Analytics } from '@aws-amplify/analytics';\n  // or better\n  + import { Analytics } from 'aws-amplify';\n\n  - import Storage from '@aws-amplify/storage';\n  + import { Storage } from '@aws-amplify/storage';\n  // or better\n  + import { Storage } from 'aws-amplify';\n  ```\n\n- Datastore predicate syntax has changed, impacting the `DataStore.query`, `DataStore.save`, `DataStore.delete`, and `DataStore.observe` interfaces. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - await DataStore.delete(Post, (post) => post.status('eq', PostStatus.INACTIVE));\n  + await DataStore.delete(Post, (post) => post.status.eq(PostStatus.INACTIVE));\n\n  - await DataStore.query(Post, p => p.and( p => [p.title('eq', 'Amplify Getting Started Guide'), p.score('gt', 8)]));\n  + await DataStore.query(Post, p => p.and( p => [p.title.eq('Amplify Getting Started Guide'), p.score.gt(8)]));\n  ```\n\n  - To use the new syntax with 5.x.x you may need to rebuild your Datastore models with the latest version of Amplify codegen. To do this:\n    - [Upgrade the Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/workflows/#upgrade-amplify-cli)\n      - `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`\n    - [Re-generate your models with Amplify codegen](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/getting-started/q/platform/js/#code-generation-amplify-cli)\n      - `amplify codegen models`\n\n- `Storage.list` has changed the name of the `maxKeys` parameter to `pageSize` and has a new return type that contains the results list. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - const photos = await Storage.list('photos/', { maxKeys: 100 });\n  - const { key } = photos[0];\n\n  + const photos = await Storage.list('photos/', { pageSize: 100 });\n  + const { key } = photos.results[0];\n  ```\n\n- `Storage.put` with resumable turned on has changed the key to no longer include the bucket name. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - let uploadedObjectKey;\n  - Storage.put(file.name, file, {\n  -   resumable: true,\n  -   // Necessary to parse the bucket name out to work with the key\n  -   completeCallback: (obj) => uploadedObjectKey = obj.key.substring( obj.key.indexOf(\"/\") + 1 )\n  - }\n\n  + let uploadedObjectKey;\n  + Storage.put(file.name, file, {\n  +   resumable: true,\n  +   completeCallback: (obj) => uploadedObjectKey = obj.key\n  + }\n  ```\n\n- `Analytics.record` no longer accepts string as input. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - Analytics.record('my example event');\n  + Analytics.record({ name: 'my example event' });\n  ```\n\n- The `JS` export has been removed from `@aws-amplify/core` in favor of exporting the functions it contained.\n- Any calls to `Amplify.Auth`, `Amplify.Cache`, and `Amplify.ServiceWorker` are no longer supported. Instead, your code should use the named exports. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';\n  - Amplify.configure(...);\n  - // ...\n  - Amplify.Auth.signIn(...);\n\n  + import { Amplify, Auth } from 'aws-amplify';\n  + Amplify.configure(...);\n  + // ...\n  + Auth.signIn(...);\n  ```\n\n### Amplify 4.x.x has breaking changes for React Native. Please see the breaking changes below:\n\n- If you are using React Native (vanilla or Expo), you will need to add the following React Native community dependencies:\n  - `@react-native-community/netinfo`\n  - `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`\n\n```\n// React Native\nyarn add aws-amplify amazon-cognito-identity-js @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\nnpx pod-install\n\n// Expo\nyarn add aws-amplify @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\n```\n\n### Amplify 3.x.x has breaking changes. Please see the breaking changes below:\n\n- `AWS.credentials` and `AWS.config` don\u2019t exist anymore in Amplify JavaScript.\n  - Both options will not be available to use in version 3. You will not be able to use and set your own credentials.\n  - For more information on this change, please see the [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/#configuration)\n- `aws-sdk@2.x` has been removed from `Amplify@3.x.x` in favor of [version 3 of aws-sdk-js](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3). We recommend to migrate to [aws-sdk-js-v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) if you rely on AWS services that are not supported by Amplify, since [aws-sdk-js-v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) is imported modularly.\n\nIf you can't migrate to [aws-sdk-js-v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) or rely on aws-sdk@2.x, you will need to import it separately.\n\n- If you are using exported paths within your Amplify JS application, (e.g. `import from \"@aws-amplify/analytics/lib/Analytics\"`) this will now break and no longer will be supported. You will need to change to named imports:\n\n  ```js\n  import { Analytics } from 'aws-amplify';\n  ```\n\n- If you are using categories as `Amplify.<Category>`, this will no longer work and we recommend to import the category you are needing to use:\n\n  ```js\n  import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';\n  ```\n\n### DataStore Docs\n\nFor more information on contributing to DataStore / how DataStore works, see the [DataStore Docs](packages/datastore/README.md)\n",
