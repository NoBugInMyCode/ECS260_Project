Even a software engineer with many years of working experience at a top IT company may not be an expert on system design. If you want to become an expert, you need to read many books, articles, and solve real large scale system design problems.\n\nThis repository only teaches you how to handle the system design interview with a systematic approach in a short time. You can dive into each topic if you have time. Of course, welcome to add your thoughts!\n\n## <a name='toc'>Table of Contents</a>\n- [ ] [System Design Interview Tips](#tips)\n- [ ] [Basic Knowledge about System Design](#intro)\n- [ ] [Company Engineering Blogs](#blog)\n- [ ] [Products and Systems](#system)\n- [ ] [Hot Questions and Reference](#qs)\n- [ ] [Good Books](#bk)\n- [ ] [Object Oriented Design](#ood)\n\n### [[\u2b06]](#toc) <a name='tips'>System Design Interview Tips:</a>\n\n**Clarify the constraints and identify the user cases**\n\nSpend a few minutes questioning the interviewer and agreeing on the scope of the system.\nRemember to make sure you know all the requirements the interviewer didn't tell you about in the beginning.\n\nUser cases indicate the main functions of the system, and constraints list the scale of the system such as requests \nper second, requests types, data written per second, data read per second.\n\n**High-level architecture design**\n\nSketch the important components and the connections between them, but don't go into some details. \nUsually, a scalable system includes webserver (load balancer), service (service partition), database (primary/secondary database cluster plug cache).\n \n**Component design**\n\nFor each component, you need to write the specific APIs for each component. You may need to finish\nthe detailed OOD design for a particular function. You may also need to design the database schema for the database.\n\n### [[\u2b06]](#toc) <a name='intro'>Basic Knowledge about System Design:</a>\n\nHere are some articles about system design related
