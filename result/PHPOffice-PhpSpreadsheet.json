Or check out the [API documentation](https://phpoffice.github.io/PhpSpreadsheet).\n\nPlease ask your support questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpspreadsheet), or have a quick chat on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet).\n\n## Patreon\n\nI am now running a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/MarkBaker) to support the work that I do on PhpSpreadsheet.\n\nSupporters will receive access to articles about working with PhpSpreadsheet, and how to use some of its more advanced features.\n\nPosts already available to Patreon supporters:\n - The Dating Game\n   - A  look at how MS Excel (and PhpSpreadsheet) handle date and time values.\n- Looping the Loop\n    - Advice on Iterating through the rows and cells in a worksheet.\n\nAnd for Patrons at levels actively using PhpSpreadsheet:\n - Behind the Mask\n   - A look at Number Format Masks.\n\nThe Next Article (currently Work in Progress):\n - Formula for Success\n   - How to debug formulae that don't produce the expected result.\n\n\nMy aim is to post at least one article each month, taking a detailed look at some feature of MS Excel and how to use that feature in PhpSpreadsheet, or on how to perform different activities in PhpSpreadsheet.\n\nPlanned posts for the future include topics like:\n - Tables\n - Structured References\n - AutoFiltering\n - Array Formulae\n - Conditional Formatting\n - Data Validation\n - Value Binders\n - Images\n - Charts\n\nAfter a period of six months exclusive to Patreon supporters, articles will be incorporated into the public documentation for the library.\n\n## PHPExcel vs PhpSpreadsheet ?\n\nPhpSpreadsheet is the next version of PHPExcel. It breaks compatibility to dramatically improve the code base quality (namespaces, PSR compliance, use of latest PHP language features, etc.).\n\nBecause all efforts have shifted to PhpSpreadsheet, PHPExcel will no longer be maintained. All contributions for PHPExcel, patches and new features, should target PhpSpreadsheet `master` branch.\n\nDo you need to migrate? There is [an automated tool](/docs/topics/migration-from-PHPExcel.md) for that.\n\n## License\n\nPhpSpreadsheet is licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/master/LICENSE).\n",
