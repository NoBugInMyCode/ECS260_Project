Learn more at [frida.re](https://frida.re/).\n\nTwo ways to install\n===================\n\n## 1. Install from prebuilt binaries\n\nThis is the recommended way to get started. All you need to do is:\n\n    pip install frida-tools # CLI tools\n    pip install frida       # Python bindings\n    npm install frida       # Node.js bindings\n\nYou may also download pre-built binaries for various operating systems from\nFrida's [releases](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases) page on GitHub.\n\n## 2. Build your own binaries\n\nRun:\n\n    make\n\nYou may also invoke `./configure` first if you want to specify a `--prefix`, or\nany other options.\n\n### CLI tools\n\nFor running the Frida CLI tools, e.g. `frida`, `frida-ls-devices`, `frida-ps`,\n`frida-kill`, `frida-trace`, `frida-discover`, etc., you need a few packages:\n\n    pip install colorama prompt-toolkit pygments\n\n### Apple OSes\n\nFirst make a trusted code-signing certificate. You can use the guide at\nhttps://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/PermissionsDarwin in the sections\n\u201cCreate a certificate in the System Keychain\u201d and \u201cTrust the certificate\nfor code signing\u201d. You can use the name `frida-cert` instead of `gdb-cert`\nif you'd like.\n\nNext export the name of the created certificate to relevant environment\nvariables, and run `make`:\n\n    export MACOS_CERTID=frida-cert\n    export IOS_CERTID=frida-cert\n    export WATCHOS_CERTID=frida-cert\n    export TVOS_CERTID=frida-cert\n    make\n\nTo ensure that macOS accepts the newly created certificate, restart the\n`taskgated` daemon:\n\n    sudo killall taskgated\n\n## Learn more\n\nHave a look at our [documentation](https://frida.re/docs/home/).\n",
