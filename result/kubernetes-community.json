How to [file an issue]\n1. How to [find something to work on]\n1. How to [open a pull request]\n\n## Membership\n\nWe encourage all contributors to become members. We aim to grow an active, healthy community of contributors, reviewers, and code owners. Learn more about requirements and responsibilities of membership in our [Community Membership] page.\n\n[Project Governance]:/governance.md\n[Developer's Guide]: contributors/devel/development.md\n[Contributor Guide]:\ncontributors/guide/README.md\n[file an issue]:\ncontributors/guide/first-contribution.md#file-an-issue\n[find something to work on]:\ncontributors/guide/first-contribution.md#find-something-to-work-on\n[open a pull request]:\ncontributors/guide/contributing.md#opening-a-pull-request\n[Community Membership]:/community-membership.md\n",
