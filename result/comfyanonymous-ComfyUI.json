instead for macOS users\n\n# Installing\n\n## Windows\n\nThere is a portable standalone build for Windows that should work for running on Nvidia GPUs or for running on your CPU only on the [releases page](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases).\n\n### [Direct link to download](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z)\n\nSimply download, extract with [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) and run. Make sure you put your Stable Diffusion checkpoints/models (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: ComfyUI\\models\\checkpoints\n\nIf you have trouble extracting it, right click the file -> properties -> unblock\n\n#### How do I share models between another UI and ComfyUI?\n\nSee the [Config file](extra_model_paths.yaml.example) to set the search paths for models. In the standalone windows build you can find this file in the ComfyUI directory. Rename this file to extra_model_paths.yaml and edit it with your favorite text editor.\n\n## Jupyter Notebook\n\nTo run it on services like paperspace, kaggle or colab you can use my [Jupyter Notebook](notebooks/comfyui_colab.ipynb)\n\n## Manual Install (Windows, Linux)\n\nNote that some dependencies do not yet support python 3.13 so using 3.12 is recommended.\n\nGit clone this repo.\n\nPut your SD checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: models/checkpoints\n\nPut your VAE in: models/vae\n\n\n### AMD GPUs (Linux only)\nAMD users can install rocm and pytorch with pip if you don't have it already installed, this is the command to install the stable version:\n\n```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.2```\n\nThis is the command to install the nightly with ROCm 6.2 which might have some performance improvements:\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.2.4```\n\n### Intel GPUs (Windows and Linux)\n\n(Option 1) Intel Arc GPU users can install native PyTorch with torch.xpu support using pip (currently available in PyTorch nightly builds). More information can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/get_start_xpu.html)\n  \n1. To install PyTorch nightly, use the following command:\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/xpu```\n\n2. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`\n\n\n(Option 2) Alternatively, Intel GPUs supported by Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) can leverage IPEX for improved performance.\n\n1. For Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 A-Series Graphics utilizing IPEX, create a conda environment and use the commands below:\n\n```\nconda install libuv\npip install torch==2.3.1.post0+cxx11.abi torchvision==0.18.1.post0+cxx11.abi torchaudio==2.3.1.post0+cxx11.abi intel-extension-for-pytorch==2.3.110.post0+xpu --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/ --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/cn/\n```\n\nFor other supported Intel GPUs with IPEX, visit [Installation](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/index.html#installation?platform=gpu) for more information.\n\nAdditional discussion and help can be found [here](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/discussions/476).\n\n### NVIDIA\n\nNvidia users should install stable pytorch using this command:\n\n```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124```\n\nThis is the command to install pytorch nightly instead which might have performance improvements:\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu126```\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you get the \"Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled\" error, uninstall torch with:\n\n```pip uninstall torch```\n\nAnd install it again with the command above.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nInstall the dependencies by opening your terminal inside the ComfyUI folder and:\n\n```pip install -r requirements.txt```\n\nAfter this you should have everything installed and can proceed to running ComfyUI.\n\n### Others:\n\n#### Apple Mac silicon\n\nYou can install ComfyUI in Apple Mac silicon (M1 or M2) with any recent macOS version.\n\n1. Install pytorch nightly. For instructions, read the [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) Apple Developer guide (make sure to install the latest pytorch nightly).\n1. Follow the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) instructions for Windows and Linux.\n1. Install the ComfyUI [dependencies](#dependencies). If you have another Stable Diffusion UI [you might be able to reuse the dependencies](#i-already-have-another-ui-for-stable-diffusion-installed-do-i-really-have-to-install-all-of-these-dependencies).\n1. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`\n\n> **Note**: Remember to add your models, VAE, LoRAs etc. to the corresponding Comfy folders, as discussed in [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux).\n\n#### DirectML (AMD Cards on Windows)\n\n```pip install torch-directml``` Then you can launch ComfyUI with: ```python main.py --directml```\n\n#### Ascend NPUs\n\nFor models compatible with Ascend Extension for PyTorch (torch_npu). To get started, ensure your environment meets the prerequisites outlined on the [installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/ascend/quick_install.html) page. Here's a step-by-step guide tailored to your platform and installation method:\n\n1. Begin by installing the recommended or newer kernel version for Linux as specified in the Installation page of torch-npu, if necessary.\n2. Proceed with the installation of Ascend Basekit, which includes the driver, firmware, and CANN, following the instructions provided for your specific platform.\n3. Next, install the necessary packages for torch-npu by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/pytorch/install.html#pytorch) page.\n4. Finally, adhere to the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) guide for Linux. Once all components are installed, you can run ComfyUI as described earlier.\n\n\n# Running\n\n```python main.py```\n\n### For AMD cards not officially supported by ROCm\n\nTry running it with this command if you have issues:\n\nFor 6700, 6600 and maybe other RDNA2 or older: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 python main.py```\n\nFor AMD 7600 and maybe other RDNA3 cards: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 python main.py```\n\n### AMD ROCm Tips\n\nYou can enable experimental memory efficient attention on pytorch 2.5 in ComfyUI on RDNA3 and potentially other AMD GPUs using this command:\n\n```TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 python main.py --use-pytorch-cross-attention```\n\nYou can also try setting this env variable `PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_ENABLED=1` which might speed things up at the cost of a very slow initial run.\n\n# Notes\n\nOnly parts of the graph that have an output with all the correct inputs will be executed.\n\nOnly parts of the graph that change from each execution to the next will be executed, if you submit the same graph twice only the first will be executed. If you change the last part of the graph only the part you changed and the part that depends on it will be executed.\n\nDragging a generated png on the webpage or loading one will give you the full workflow including seeds that were used to create it.\n\nYou can use () to change emphasis of a word or phrase like: (good code:1.2) or (bad code:0.8). The default emphasis for () is 1.1. To use () characters in your actual prompt escape them like \\\\( or \\\\).\n\nYou can use {day|night}, for wildcard/dynamic prompts. With this syntax \"{wild|card|test}\" will be randomly replaced by either \"wild\", \"card\" or \"test\" by the frontend every time you queue the prompt. To use {} characters in your actual prompt escape them like: \\\\{ or \\\\}.\n\nDynamic prompts also support C-style comments, like `// comment` or `/* comment */`.\n\nTo use a textual inversion concepts/embeddings in a text prompt put them in the models/embeddings directory and use them in the CLIPTextEncode node like this (you can omit the .pt extension):\n\n```embedding:embedding_filename.pt```\n\n\n## How to show high-quality previews?\n\nUse ```--preview-method auto``` to enable previews.\n\nThe default installation includes a fast latent preview method that's low-resolution. To enable higher-quality previews with [TAESD](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd), download the [taesd_decoder.pth, taesdxl_decoder.pth, taesd3_decoder.pth and taef1_decoder.pth](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd/) and place them in the `models/vae_approx` folder. Once they're installed, restart ComfyUI and launch it with `--preview-method taesd` to enable high-quality previews.\n\n## How to use TLS/SSL?\nGenerate a self-signed certificate (not appropriate for shared/production use) and key by running the command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -subj \"/C=XX/ST=StateName/L=CityName/O=CompanyName/OU=CompanySectionName/CN=CommonNameOrHostname\"`\n\nUse `--tls-keyfile key.pem --tls-certfile cert.pem` to enable TLS/SSL, the app will now be accessible with `https://...` instead of `http://...`.\n\n> Note: Windows users can use [alexisrolland/docker-openssl](https://github.com/alexisrolland/docker-openssl) or one of the [3rd party binary distributions](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries) to run the command example above. \n<br/><br/>If you use a container, note that the volume mount `-v` can be a relative path so `... -v \".\\:/openssl-certs\" ...` would create the key & cert files in the current directory of your command prompt or powershell terminal.\n\n## Support and dev channel\n\n[Matrix space: #comfyui_space:matrix.org](https://app.element.io/#/room/%23comfyui_space%3Amatrix.org) (it's like discord but open source).\n\nSee also: [https://www.comfy.org/](https://www.comfy.org/)\n\n## Frontend Development\n\nAs of August 15, 2024, we have transitioned to a new frontend, which is now hosted in a separate repository: [ComfyUI Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend). This repository now hosts the compiled JS (from TS/Vue) under the `web/` directory.\n\n### Reporting Issues and Requesting Features\n\nFor any bugs, issues, or feature requests related to the frontend, please use the [ComfyUI Frontend repository](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend). This will help us manage and address frontend-specific concerns more efficiently.\n\n### Using the Latest Frontend\n\nThe new frontend is now the default for ComfyUI. However, please note:\n\n1. The frontend in the main ComfyUI repository is updated weekly.\n2. Daily releases are available in the separate frontend repository.\n\nTo use the most up-to-date frontend version:\n\n1. For the latest daily release, launch ComfyUI with this command line argument:\n\n   ```\n   --front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@latest\n   ```\n\n2. For a specific version, replace `latest` with the desired version number:\n\n   ```\n   --front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@1.2.2\n   ```\n\nThis approach allows you to easily switch between the stable weekly release and the cutting-edge daily updates, or even specific versions for testing purposes.\n\n### Accessing the Legacy Frontend\n\nIf you need to use the legacy frontend for any reason, you can access it using the following command line argument:\n\n```\n--front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_legacy_frontend@latest\n```\n\nThis will use a snapshot of the legacy frontend preserved in the [ComfyUI Legacy Frontend repository](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_legacy_frontend).\n\n# QA\n\n### Which GPU should I buy for this?\n\n[See this page for some recommendations](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/wiki/Which-GPU-should-I-buy-for-ComfyUI)\n",
