It was designed to help remind \\*nix system administrators of\noptions for commands that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to\nremember.\n\n![The obligatory xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png 'The obligatory xkcd')\n\nUse `cheat` with [cheatsheets][].\n\n\nExample\n-------\nThe next time you're forced to disarm a nuclear weapon without consulting\nGoogle, you may run:\n\n```sh\ncheat tar\n```\n\nYou will be presented with a cheatsheet resembling the following:\n\n```sh\n# To extract an uncompressed archive:\ntar -xvf '/path/to/foo.tar'\n\n# To extract a .gz archive:\ntar -xzvf '/path/to/foo.tgz'\n\n# To create a .gz archive:\ntar -czvf '/path/to/foo.tgz' '/path/to/foo/'\n\n# To extract a .bz2 archive:\ntar -xjvf '/path/to/foo.tgz'\n\n# To create a .bz2 archive:\ntar -cjvf '/path/to/foo.tgz' '/path/to/foo/'\n```\n\nUsage\n-----\nTo view a cheatsheet:\n\n```sh\ncheat tar      # a \"top-level\" cheatsheet\ncheat foo/bar  # a \"nested\" cheatsheet\n```\n\nTo edit a cheatsheet:\n\n```sh\ncheat -e tar     # opens the \"tar\" cheatsheet for editing, or creates it if it does not exist\ncheat -e foo/bar # nested cheatsheets are accessed like this\n```\n\nTo view the configured cheatpaths:\n\n```sh\ncheat -d\n```\n\nTo list all available cheatsheets:\n\n```sh\ncheat -l\n```\n\nTo list all cheatsheets that are tagged with \"networking\":\n\n```sh\ncheat -l -t networking\n```\n\nTo list all cheatsheets on the \"personal\" path:\n\n```sh\ncheat -l -p personal\n```\n\nTo search for the phrase \"ssh\" among cheatsheets:\n\n```sh\ncheat -s ssh\n```\n\nTo search (by regex) for cheatsheets that contain an IP address:\n\n```sh\ncheat -r -s '(?:[0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'\n```\n\nFlags may be combined in intuitive ways. Example: to search sheets on the\n\"personal\" cheatpath that are tagged with \"networking\" and match a regex:\n\n```sh\ncheat -p personal -t networking --regex -s '(?:[0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'\n```\n\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\nFor installation and configuration instructions, see [INSTALLING.md][].\n\nCheatsheets\n-----------\nCheatsheets are plain-text files with no file extension, and are named\naccording to the command used to view them:\n\n```sh\ncheat tar     # file is named \"tar\"\ncheat foo/bar # file is named \"bar\", in a \"foo\" subdirectory\n```\n\nCheatsheet text may optionally be preceeded by a YAML frontmatter header that\nassigns tags and specifies syntax:\n\n```\n---\nsyntax: javascript\ntags: [ array, map ]\n---\n// To map over an array:\nconst squares = [1, 2, 3, 4].map(x => x * x);\n```\n\nThe `cheat` executable includes no cheatsheets, but [community-sourced\ncheatsheets are available][cheatsheets]. You will be asked if you would like to\ninstall the community-sourced cheatsheets the first time you run `cheat`.\n\nCheatpaths\n----------\nCheatsheets are stored on \"cheatpaths\", which are directories that contain\ncheatsheets. Cheatpaths are specified in the `conf.yml` file.\n\nIt can be useful to configure `cheat` against multiple cheatpaths. A common\npattern is to store cheatsheets from multiple repositories on individual\ncheatpaths:\n\n```yaml\n# conf.yml:\n# ...\ncheatpaths:\n  - name: community                   # a name for the cheatpath\n    path: ~/documents/cheat/community # the path's location on the filesystem\n    tags: [ community ]               # these tags will be applied to all sheets on the path\n    readonly: true                    # if true, `cheat` will not create new cheatsheets here\n\n  - name: personal\n    path: ~/documents/cheat/personal  # this is a separate directory and repository than above\n    tags: [ personal ]\n    readonly: false                   # new sheets may be written here\n# ...\n```\n\nThe `readonly` option instructs `cheat` not to edit (or create) any cheatsheets\non the path. This is useful to prevent merge-conflicts from arising on upstream\ncheatsheet repositories.\n\nIf a user attempts to edit a cheatsheet on a read-only cheatpath, `cheat` will\ntransparently copy that sheet to a writeable directory before opening it for\nediting.\n\n### Directory-scoped Cheatpaths ###\nAt times, it can be useful to closely associate cheatsheets with a directory on\nyour filesystem. `cheat` facilitates this by searching for a `.cheat` folder in\nthe current working directory. If found, the `.cheat` directory will\n(temporarily) be added to the cheatpaths.\n\nAutocompletion\n--------------\nShell autocompletion is currently available for `bash`, `fish`, and `zsh`. Copy\nthe relevant [completion script][completions] into the appropriate directory on\nyour filesystem to enable autocompletion. (This directory will vary depending\non operating system and shell specifics.)\n\nAdditionally, `cheat` supports enhanced autocompletion via integration with\n[fzf][]. To enable `fzf` integration:\n\n1. Ensure that `fzf` is available on your `$PATH`\n2. Set an envvar: `export CHEAT_USE_FZF=true`\n\n[INSTALLING.md]: INSTALLING.md\n[Releases]:      https://github.com/cheat/cheat/releases\n[cheatsheets]:   https://github.com/cheat/cheatsheets\n[completions]:   https://github.com/cheat/cheat/tree/master/scripts\n[fzf]:           https://github.com/junegunn/fzf\n[go]:            https://golang.org\n",
