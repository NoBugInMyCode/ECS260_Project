PRs that are\ncherry-picked into an older Kubernetes release branch will result in an update\nto the corresponding branch in `client-go`, with a corresponding new tag\nchanging the patch version.\n\n#### Branches and tags.\n\nWe will create a new branch and tag for each increment in the minor version\nnumber. We will create only a new tag for each increment in the patch\nversion number. See [semver](http://semver.org/) for definitions of major,\nminor, and patch.\n\nThe HEAD of the master branch in client-go will track the HEAD of the master\nbranch in the main Kubernetes repo.\n\n#### Compatibility: your code <-> client-go\n\nThe `v0.x.y` tags indicate that go APIs may change in incompatible ways in\ndifferent versions.\n\nSee [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for guidelines on requiring a specific\nversion of client-go.\n\n#### Compatibility: client-go <-> Kubernetes clusters\n\nSince Kubernetes is backwards compatible with clients, older `client-go`\nversions will work with many different Kubernetes cluster versions.\n\nWe will backport bugfixes--but not new features--into older versions of\n`client-go`.\n\n\n#### Compatibility matrix\n\n|                               | Kubernetes 1.27 | Kubernetes 1.28 | Kubernetes 1.29 | Kubernetes 1.30 | Kubernetes 1.31 | Kubernetes 1.32 |\n| ----------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |\n| `kubernetes-1.27.0`/`v0.27.0` | \u2713               | +-              | +-              | +-              | +-              | +-              |\n| `kubernetes-1.28.0`/`v0.28.0` | +-              | \u2713               | +-              | +-              | +-              | +-              |\n| `kubernetes-1.29.0`/`v0.29.0` | +-              | +-              | \u2713               | +-              | +-              | +-              |\n| `kubernetes-1.30.0`/`v0.30.0` | +-              | +-              | +-              | \u2713               | +-              | +-              |\n| `kubernetes-1.31.0`/`v0.31.0` | +-              | +-              | +-              | +-              | \u2713               | +-              |\n| `kubernetes-1.32.0`/`v0.32.0` | +-              | +-              | +-              | +-              | +-              | \u2713               |\n| `HEAD`                        | +-              | +-              | +-              | +-              | +-              | +-              |\n\nKey:\n\n* `\u2713` Exactly the same features / API objects in both client-go and the Kubernetes\n  version.\n* `+` client-go has features or API objects that may not be present in the\n  Kubernetes cluster, either due to that client-go has additional new API, or\n  that the server has removed old API. However, everything they have in\n  common (i.e., most APIs) will work. Please note that alpha APIs may vanish or\n  change significantly in a single release.\n* `-` The Kubernetes cluster has features the client-go library can't use,\n  either due to the server has additional new API, or that client-go has\n  removed old API. However, everything they share in common (i.e., most APIs)\n  will work.\n\nSee the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed description of changes\nbetween client-go versions.\n\n| Branch         | Canonical source code location      | Maintenance status |\n| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ |\n| `release-1.23` | Kubernetes main repo, 1.23 branch   | =-                 |\n| `release-1.24` | Kubernetes main repo, 1.24 branch   | =-                 |\n| `release-1.25` | Kubernetes main repo, 1.25 branch   | =-                 |\n| `release-1.26` | Kubernetes main repo, 1.26 branch   | =-                 |\n| `release-1.27` | Kubernetes main repo, 1.27 branch   | =-                 |\n| `release-1.28` | Kubernetes main repo, 1.28 branch   | =-                 |\n| `release-1.29` | Kubernetes main repo, 1.29 branch   | \u2713                  |\n| `release-1.30` | Kubernetes main repo, 1.30 branch   | \u2713                  |\n| `release-1.31` | Kubernetes main repo, 1.31 branch   | \u2713                  |\n| `release-1.32` | Kubernetes main repo, 1.32 branch   | \u2713                  |\n| client-go HEAD | Kubernetes main repo, master branch | \u2713                  |\n\nKey:\n\n* `\u2713` Changes in main Kubernetes repo are actively published to client-go by a bot\n* `=` Maintenance is manual, only severe security bugs will be patched.\n* `-` Deprecated; please upgrade.\n\n#### Deprecation policy\n\nWe will maintain branches for at least six months after their first stable tag\nis cut. (E.g., the clock for the release-2.0 branch started ticking when we\ntagged v2.0.0, not when we made the first alpha.) This policy applies to\nevery version greater than or equal to 2.0.\n\n#### Why do the 1.4 and 1.5 branch contain top-level folder named after the version?\n\nFor the initial release of client-go, we thought it would be easiest to keep\nseparate directories for each minor version. That soon proved to be a mistake.\nWe are keeping the top-level folders in the 1.4 and 1.5 branches so that\nexisting users won't be broken.\n\n### Kubernetes tags\n\nThis repository is still a mirror of\n[k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/src/client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/staging/src/k8s.io/client-go),\nthe code development is still done in the staging area.\n\nSince Kubernetes `v1.8.0`, when syncing the code from the staging area,\nwe also sync the Kubernetes version tags to client-go, prefixed with\n`kubernetes-`. From Kubernetes `v1.17.0`, we also create matching semver\n`v0.x.y` tags for each `v1.x.y` Kubernetes release.\n\nFor example, if you check out the `kubernetes-1.17.0` or the `v0.17.0` tag in\nclient-go, the code you get is exactly the same as if you check out the `v1.17.0`\ntag in Kubernetes, and change directory to `staging/src/k8s.io/client-go`.\n\nThe purpose is to let users quickly find matching commits among published repos,\nlike [sample-apiserver](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-apiserver),\n[apiextension-apiserver](https://github.com/kubernetes/apiextensions-apiserver),\netc. The Kubernetes version tag does NOT claim any backwards compatibility\nguarantees for client-go. Please check the [semantic versions](#versioning) if\nyou care about backwards compatibility.\n\n### How to get it\n\nTo get the latest version, use go1.16+ and fetch using the `go get` command. For example:\n\n```\ngo get k8s.io/client-go@latest\n```\n\nTo get a specific version, use go1.11+ and fetch the desired version using the `go get` command. For example:\n\n```\ngo get k8s.io/client-go@v0.20.4\n```\n\nSee [INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.\n\n### How to use it\n\nIf your application runs in a Pod in the cluster, please refer to the\nin-cluster [example](examples/in-cluster-client-configuration), otherwise please\nrefer to the out-of-cluster [example](examples/out-of-cluster-client-configuration).\n\n### Dependency management\n\nFor details on how to correctly use a dependency management for installing client-go, please see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).\n\n### Contributing code\nPlease send pull requests against the client packages in the Kubernetes main [repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes). Changes in the staging area will be published to this repository every day.\n",
