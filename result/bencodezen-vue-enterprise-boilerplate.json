        "readme": "# Vue Enterprise Boilerplate v3 (alpha)\n\nThis repo is currently in active development and considered in alpha release.\n\n> This is an ever-evolving, opinionated architecture and dev environment for new Vue 3 + Vite SPA projects using [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue).\n\n\ud83c\udfa9 A huge thanks to [Chris Fritz](https://twitter.com/chrisvfritz) for the incredible work that this work builds upon. For those looking for his version, see [this branch for the original Vue 2 enterprise boilerplate](https://github.com/bencodezen/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/tree/vue-2-version).\n\n## Recommended IDE Setup\n\n[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).\n\n## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS\n\nTypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.\n\nIf the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:\n\n1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension\n   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette\n   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`\n2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.\n\n## Project Setup\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development\n\n```sh\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\n### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)\n\n```sh\nnpm run test:unit\n```\n\n### Run End-to-End Tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)\n\n```sh\n# Install browsers for the first run\nnpx playwright install\n\n# When testing on CI, must build the project first\nnpm run build\n\n# Runs the end-to-end tests\nnpm run test:e2e\n# Runs the tests only on Chromium\nnpm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium\n# Runs the tests of a specific file\nnpm run test:e2e -- tests/example.spec.ts\n# Runs the tests in debug mode\nnpm run test:e2e -- --debug\n```\n\n### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint\n```\n",
