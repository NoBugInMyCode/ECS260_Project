You can learn why `XCTAssert()` statements make your expectations unclear and how to fix that using Nimble assertions [here](./Documentation/en-us/NimbleAssertions.md).\n\n## Swift Version\n\nCertain versions of Quick and Nimble only support certain versions of Swift. Depending on which version of Swift your project uses, you should use specific versions of Quick and Nimble. Use the table below to determine which versions of Quick and Nimble are compatible with your project.\n\n|Swift version        |Quick version   |Nimble version |\n|:--------------------|:---------------|:--------------|\n|Swift 5.2            |v3.0.0 or later |v9.0.0 or later|\n|Swift 4.2 / Swift 5  |v1.3.2 or later |v7.3.2 or later|\n|Swift 3 / Swift 4    |v1.0.0 or later |v5.0.0 or later|\n|Swift 2.2 / Swift 2.3|v0.9.3          |v4.1.0         |\n\n## Documentation\n\nAll documentation can be found in the [Documentation folder](./Documentation), including [detailed installation instructions](./Documentation/en-us/InstallingQuick.md) for CocoaPods, Carthage, Git submodules, Swift Package Manager, and more. For example, you can install Quick and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) using CocoaPods by adding the following to your `Podfile`:\n\n```rb\n# Podfile\n\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget \"MyApp\" do\n  # Normal libraries\n\n  target 'MyApp_Tests' do\n    inherit! :search_paths\n\n    pod 'Quick'\n    pod 'Nimble'\n  end\nend\n```\n\nYou can also install Quick and Nimble using Swift Package Manager by adding the following to the dependencies section your `Package.swift`:\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/Quick/Quick.git\", from: \"7.0.0\"),\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/Quick/Nimble.git\", from: \"12.0.0\"),\n],\n```\n\n## Projects using Quick\n\nOver ten-thousand apps use either Quick and Nimble however, as they are not included in the app binary, neither appear in \u201cTop Used Libraries\u201d blog posts. Therefore, it would be greatly appreciated to remind contributors that their efforts are valued by compiling a list of organizations and projects that use them. \n\nDoes your organization or project use Quick and Nimble? If yes, [please add your project to the list](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/wiki/Projects-using-Quick).\n\n## Who uses Quick\n\nSimilar to projects using Quick, it would be nice to hear why people use Quick and Nimble. Are there features you love? Are there features that are just okay? Are there some features we have that no one uses?\n\nHave something positive to say about Quick (or Nimble)? If yes, [provide a testimonial here](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/wiki/Who-uses-Quick).\n\n## Privacy Statement\n\nQuick is a library that is only used for testing and should never be included in the binary submitted to App Store Connect.\nYour app will be rejected if you do include Quick in the submitted binary because Quick uses private APIs to better integrate with Xcode.\n\nDespite not being shipped to Apple, Quick does not and will never collect any kind of analytics or tracking.\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0 license.
