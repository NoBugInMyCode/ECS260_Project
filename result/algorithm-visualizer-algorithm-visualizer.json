Whether you're a student, teacher, or professional, our platform provides an engaging way to explore and understand various algorithms.\n\n[![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/graphs/contributors)\n[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n## Languages and Frameworks Used\n[![Languages](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,react,nodejs,redux)](https://skillicons.dev)\n\n\n## Key Features\n<ul> \n<li>\n\n### Visualize algorithms from code:\nAlgorithm Visualizer allows you to witness algorithms in action by visualizing code written in various programming languages. This visual approach facilitates a better understanding of algorithmic behavior..</li>\n<li>\n\n### Learn about Algorithms:\nExplore our collection of tutorials, articles, and videos that serve as valuable resources for learning about algorithms.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n## algorithms\nIn this repository, you'll find visualizations of algorithms showcased in the website's side menu. Contributions here directly impact the educational content available on the platform.   https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## tracers\nExplore the various visualization libraries in different programming languages. These libraries extract visualization commands from code.\nhttps://github.com/search?q=topic%3Avisualization-library+org%3Aalgorithm-visualizer&type=Repositories</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Live Demo\nLearning an algorithm gets much easier with visualizing it. Don't get what we mean? Check it out:\n\n[**algorithm-visualizer.org**![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/master/branding/screenshot.png)](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/)\n\n## Contributing\n\nOur project consists of multiple repositories, each playing a crucial role in the Algorithm Visualizer ecosystem. If you're interested in contributing, check out the guidelines for the specific repository:\n\n\n- [**`algorithm-visualizer`**](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer) is a web app written in React. It contains UI components and interprets commands into visualizations. Check out [the contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n- [**`server`**](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/server) serves the web app and provides APIs that it needs on the fly. (e.g., GitHub sign in, compiling/running code, etc.)\n\n- [**`algorithms`**](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms) contains visualizations of algorithms shown on the side menu of the website.\n\n- [**`tracers.*`**](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Avisualization-library+org%3Aalgorithm-visualizer&type=Repositories) are visualization libraries written in each supported language. They extract visualizing commands from code.\n\nReady to contribute? Explore the repositories and become part of the Algorithm Visualizer community!",
