Directly saving the Raw files no longer breaks line endings_  \r\n_We did it! We broke [the previous gist](https://git.io/MediaCreationTool.bat)_ ;) So this is the new home. **Thank you all!**  \r\n\r\n[discuss on MDL](https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/universal-mediacreationtool-wrapper-script-create-windows-11-media-with-automatic-bypass.84168/)  \r\n\r\n```\r\n2018.10.10: reinstated 1809 [RS5]! using native xml patching for products.xml;
