[Join slack team](https://join.slack.com/t/vuls-github/shared_invite/zt-1fculjwj4-6nex2JNE7DpOSiKZ1ztDFw)  \nTwitter: [@vuls_en](https://twitter.com/vuls_en)\n\n![Vuls-Abstract](img/vuls-abstract.png)\n\n![Vulsrepo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usiusi360/vulsrepo/master/gallery/demo.gif)\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/3y9zrf950agiko7klg8abvyck.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/3y9zrf950agiko7klg8abvyck)\n\n![Vuls-slack](img/vuls-slack-en.png)\n\n----\n\n## Abstract\n\nFor a system administrator, having to perform security vulnerability analysis and software update on a daily basis can be a burden.\nTo avoid downtime in a production environment, it is common for a system administrator to choose not to use the automatic update option provided by the package manager and to perform update manually.\nThis leads to the following problems.\n\n- The system administrator will have to constantly watch out for any new vulnerabilities in NVD (National Vulnerability Database) or similar databases.\n- It might be impossible for the system administrator to monitor all the software if there are a large number of software packages installed in the server.\n- It is expensive to perform analysis to determine the servers affected by new vulnerabilities. The possibility of overlooking a server or two during analysis is there.\n\nVuls is a tool created to solve the problems listed above. It has the following characteristics.\n\n- Informs users of the vulnerabilities that are related to the system.\n- Informs users of the servers that are affected.\n- Vulnerability detection is done automatically to prevent any oversight.\n- A report is generated on a regular basis using CRON or other methods. to manage vulnerability.\n\n![Vuls-Motivation](img/vuls-motivation.png)\n\n----\n\n## Main Features\n\n### Scan for any vulnerabilities in Linux/FreeBSD/Windows/macOS\n\n[Supports major Linux/FreeBSD/Windows/macOS](https://vuls.io/docs/en/supported-os.html)\n\n- Alpine, Amazon Linux, CentOS, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, Debian, Oracle Linux, Raspbian, RHEL, openSUSE, openSUSE Leap, SUSE Enterprise Linux, Fedora, and Ubuntu\n- FreeBSD\n- Windows\n- macOS\n- Cloud, on-premise, Running Docker Container\n\n### High-quality scan\n\n- Vulnerability Database\n  - [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/)\n  - [JVN(Japanese)](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/apis/myjvn/)\n\n- OVAL\n  - [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/)\n  - [Debian](https://www.debian.org/security/oval/)\n  - [Ubuntu](https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval/)\n  - [SUSE](http://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/)\n  - [Oracle Linux](https://linux.oracle.com/security/oval/)\n\n- Security Advisory\n  - [Alpine-secdb](https://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/alpine-secdb/)\n  - [Red Hat Security Advisories](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/)\n  - [Debian Security Bug Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/)\n  - [Ubuntu CVE Tracker](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/)\n  - [Microsoft CVRF](https://api.msrc.microsoft.com/cvrf/v2.0/swagger/index)\n\n- Commands(yum, zypper, pkg-audit)\n  - RHSA / ALAS / ELSA / FreeBSD-SA\n  - Changelog\n\n- PoC, Exploit\n  - [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/)\n  - [Metasploit-Framework modules](https://www.rapid7.com/db/?q=&type=metasploit)\n  - [qazbnm456/awesome-cve-poc](https://github.com/qazbnm456/awesome-cve-poc)\n  - [nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub](https://github.com/nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub)\n  - [gmatuz/inthewilddb](https://github.com/gmatuz/inthewilddb)\n\n- CERT\n  - [US-CERT](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts)\n  - [JPCERT](http://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2019.html)\n\n- KEV\n  - CISA(Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency): [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n  - VulnCheck: [VulnCheck KEV](https://vulncheck.com/kev)\n\n- Cyber Threat Intelligence(MITRE ATT&CK and CAPEC)\n  - [mitre/cti](https://github.com/mitre/cti)\n\n- Libraries\n  - [aquasecurity/vuln-list](https://github.com/aquasecurity/vuln-list)\n\n- WordPress\n  - [wpscan](https://wpscan.com/api)\n\n### Scan mode\n\n[Fast Scan](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-fast-scan.html)\n\n- Scan without root privilege, no dependencies\n- Almost no load on the scan target server\n- Offline mode scan with no internet access. (CentOS, Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, Debian, Oracle Linux, Red Hat, Fedora, and Ubuntu)\n\n[Fast Root Scan](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-fast-root-scan.html)\n\n- Scan with root privilege\n- Almost no load on the scan target server\n- Detect processes affected by update using yum-ps (Amazon Linux, CentOS, Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, Oracle Linux, Fedora, and RedHat)\n- Detect processes which updated before but not restarting yet using checkrestart of debian-goodies (Debian and Ubuntu)\n- Offline mode scan with no internet access. (CentOS, Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, Debian, Oracle Linux, Red Hat, Fedora, and Ubuntu)\n\n### [Remote, Local scan mode, Server mode](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-remote-local.html)\n\n[Remote scan mode](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-remote-scan.html)\n\n- User is required to only set up one machine that is connected to other target servers via SSH\n\n[Local scan mode](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-local-scan.html)\n\n- If you don't want the central Vuls server to connect to each server by SSH, you can use Vuls in the Local Scan mode.\n\n[Server mode](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-server.html)\n\n- First, start Vuls in server mode and listen as an HTTP server.\n- Next, issue a command on the scan target server to collect software information. Then send the result to Vuls Server via HTTP. You receive the scan results as JSON format.\n- No SSH needed, No Scanner needed. Only issuing Linux commands directory on the scan target server.\n\n### **Dynamic** Analysis\n\n- It is possible to acquire the state of the server by connecting via SSH and executing the command.\n- Vuls warns when the scan target server was updated the kernel etc. but not restarting it.\n\n### Scan vulnerabilities of non-OS-packages\n\n- Libraries of programming language\n- Self-compiled software\n- Network Devices\n\nVuls has some options to detect the vulnerabilities\n\n- [Lockfile based Scan](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#library-vulns-scan)\n- [GitHub Integration](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#usage-integrate-with-github-security-alerts)\n- [Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) based Scan](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#cpe-scan)\n- [OWASP Dependency Check Integration](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#usage-integrate-with-owasp-dependency-check-to-automatic-update-when-the-libraries-are-updated-experimental)\n\n## Scan WordPress core, themes, plugins\n\n- [Scan WordPress](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-wordpress.html)\n\n## MISC\n\n- Nondestructive testing\n- Pre-authorization is *NOT* necessary before scanning on AWS\n  - Vuls works well with Continuous Integration since tests can be run every day. This allows you to find vulnerabilities very quickly.\n- Auto-generation of configuration file template\n  - Auto-detection of servers set using CIDR, generate configuration file template\n- Email and Slack notification is possible (supports Japanese language)\n- Scan result is viewable on accessory software, TUI Viewer in a terminal or Web UI ([VulsRepo](https://github.com/ishiDACo/vulsrepo)).\n\n----\n\n## What Vuls Doesn't Do\n\n- Vuls doesn't update the vulnerable packages.\n\n----\n\n## Document\n\nFor more information such as Installation, Tutorial, Usage, visit [vuls.io](https://vuls.io/)  \n[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u7ffb\u8a33\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8](https://vuls.io/ja/)\n\n----\n\n## Authors\n\nkotakanbe ([@kotakanbe](https://twitter.com/kotakanbe)) created vuls and [these fine people](https://github.com/future-architect/vuls/graphs/contributors) have contributed.\n\n## Contribute\n\nsee [vulsdoc](https://vuls.io/docs/en/how-to-contribute.html)\n\n----\n\n## Sponsors\n\n|  |  |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| <a href=\"https://www.tines.com/?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=vuls\"><img src=\"img/sponsor/tines.png\" align=\"left\" width=\"600px\" ></a> | Tines is no-code automation for security teams.
