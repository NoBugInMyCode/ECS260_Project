It provides the\nfoundation for the high-level SSH library `Fabric <https://fabfile.org>`_,\nwhich is what we recommend you use for common client use-cases such as running\nremote shell commands or transferring files.\n\nDirect use of Paramiko itself is only intended for users who need\nadvanced/low-level primitives or want to run an in-Python sshd.\n\nFor installation information, changelogs, FAQs and similar, please visit `our\nmain project website <https://paramiko.org>`_; for API details, see `the\nversioned docs <https://docs.paramiko.org>`_. Additionally, the project\nmaintainer keeps a `roadmap <http://bitprophet.org/projects#roadmap>`_ on his\npersonal site.\n\n.. [#]\n    Paramiko relies on `cryptography <https://cryptography.io>`_ for crypto\n    functionality, which makes use of C and Rust extensions but has many\n    precompiled options available. See `our installation page\n    <https://www.paramiko.org/installing.html>`_ for details.\n\n.. [#]\n    OpenSSH's RFC specification page is a fantastic resource and collection of\n    links that we won't bother replicating here:\n    https://www.openssh.com/specs.html\n\n    OpenSSH itself also happens to be our primary reference implementation:\n    when in doubt, we consult how they do things, unless there are good reasons\n    not to. There are always some gaps, but we do our best to reconcile them\n    when possible.\n",
