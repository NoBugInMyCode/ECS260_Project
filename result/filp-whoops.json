Out-of-the-box, it provides a pretty\nerror interface that helps you debug your web projects, but at heart it's a simple yet\npowerful stacked error handling system.\n\n## Features\n\n- Flexible, stack-based error handling\n- Stand-alone library with (currently) no required dependencies\n- Simple API for dealing with exceptions, trace frames & their data\n- Includes a pretty rad error page for your webapp projects\n- Includes the ability to [open referenced files directly in your editor and IDE](docs/Open%20Files%20In%20An%20Editor.md)\n- Includes handlers for different response formats (JSON, XML, SOAP)\n- Easy to extend and integrate with existing libraries\n- Clean, well-structured & tested code-base\n\n## Sponsors\n\n<a href=\"https://blackfire.io/docs/introduction?utm_source=whoops&amp;utm_medium=github_readme&amp;utm_campaign=logo\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zR8rsqk.png\" alt=\"Blackfire.io\" width=\"254\" height=\"64\"></a>\n\n## Installing\nIf you use Laravel 4, Laravel 5.5+ or [Mezzio](https://docs.mezzio.dev/mezzio/), you already have Whoops. There are also community-provided instructions on how to integrate Whoops into\n[Silex 1](https://github.com/whoops-php/silex-1),\n[Silex 2](https://github.com/texthtml/whoops-silex),\n[Phalcon](https://github.com/whoops-php/phalcon),\n[Laravel 3](https://gist.github.com/hugomrdias/5169713#file-start-php),\n[Laravel 5](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Exceptions),\n[CakePHP 3](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-whoops/tree/cake3),\n[CakePHP 4](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-whoops),\n[Zend 2](https://github.com/ghislainf/zf2-whoops),\n[Zend 3](https://github.com/Ppito/zf3-whoops),\n[Yii 1](https://github.com/igorsantos07/yii-whoops),\n[FuelPHP](https://github.com/indigophp/fuel-whoops),\n[Slim](https://github.com/zeuxisoo/php-slim-whoops/),\n[Pimple](https://github.com/texthtml/whoops-pimple),\n[Laminas](https://github.com/Ppito/laminas-whoops),\nor any framework consuming [StackPHP middlewares](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/whoops-stackphp)\nor [PSR-7 middlewares](https://github.com/franzliedke/whoops-middleware).\n\nIf you are not using any of these frameworks, here's a very simple way to install:\n\n1. Use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to install Whoops into your project:\n\n    ```bash\n    composer require filp/whoops\n    ```\n\n1. Register the pretty handler in your code:\n\n    ```php\n    $whoops = new \\Whoops\\Run;\n    $whoops->pushHandler(new \\Whoops\\Handler\\PrettyPageHandler);\n    $whoops->register();\n    ```\n\nFor more options, have a look at the **example files** in [`examples/`](./examples) to get a feel for how things work. Also take a look at the [API Documentation](docs/API%20Documentation.md) and the list of available handlers below.\n\nYou may also want to override some system calls Whoops does. To do that, extend `Whoops\\Util\\SystemFacade`, override functions that you want and pass it as the argument to the `Run` constructor.\n\nYou may also collect the HTML generated to process it yourself:\n\n```php\n$whoops = new \\Whoops\\Run;\n$whoops->allowQuit(false);\n$whoops->writeToOutput(false);\n$whoops->pushHandler(new \\Whoops\\Handler\\PrettyPageHandler);\n$html = $whoops->handleException($e);\n```\n\n### Available Handlers\n\n**whoops** currently ships with the following built-in handlers, available in the `Whoops\\Handler` namespace:\n\n- [`PrettyPageHandler`](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/src/Whoops/Handler/PrettyPageHandler.php) - Shows a pretty error page when something goes pants-up\n- [`PlainTextHandler`](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/src/Whoops/Handler/PlainTextHandler.php) - Outputs plain text message for use in CLI applications\n- [`CallbackHandler`](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/src/Whoops/Handler/CallbackHandler.php) - Wraps a closure or other callable as a handler. You do not need to use this handler explicitly, **whoops** will automatically wrap any closure or callable you pass to `Whoops\\Run::pushHandler`\n- [`JsonResponseHandler`](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/src/Whoops/Handler/JsonResponseHandler.php) - Captures exceptions and returns information on them as a JSON string. Can be used to, for example, play nice with AJAX requests.\n- [`XmlResponseHandler`](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/src/Whoops/Handler/XmlResponseHandler.php) - Captures exceptions and returns information on them as a XML string. Can be used to, for example, play nice with AJAX requests.\n\nYou can also use pluggable handlers, such as [SOAP handler](https://github.com/whoops-php/soap).\n\n## Authors\n\nThis library was primarily developed by [Filipe Dobreira](https://github.com/filp), and is currently maintained by [Denis Sokolov](https://github.com/denis-sokolov). A lot of awesome fixes and enhancements were also sent in by [various contributors](https://github.com/filp/whoops/contributors).
