It is the underlying database for [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io), a\nfast, distributed graph database. It's meant to be a performant alternative to\nnon-Go-based key-value stores like RocksDB.\n\n## Project Status\n\nBadger is stable and is being used to serve data sets worth hundreds of\nterabytes. Badger supports concurrent ACID transactions with serializable\nsnapshot isolation (SSI) guarantees. A Jepsen-style bank test runs nightly for\n8h, with `--race` flag and ensures the maintenance of transactional guarantees.\nBadger has also been tested to work with filesystem level anomalies, to ensure\npersistence and consistency. Badger is being used by a number of projects which\nincludes Dgraph, Jaeger Tracing, UsenetExpress, and many more.\n\nThe list of projects using Badger can be found [here](#projects-using-badger).\n\nBadger v1.0 was released in Nov 2017, and the latest version that is data-compatible\nwith v1.0 is v1.6.0.\n\nBadger v2.0 was released in Nov 2019 with a new storage format which won't\nbe compatible with all of the v1.x. Badger v2.0 supports compression, encryption and uses a cache to speed up lookup.\n\nBadger v3.0 was released in January 2021.  This release improves compaction performance.\n\nPlease consult the [Changelog] for more detailed information on releases.\n\nFor more details on our version naming schema please read [Choosing a version](#choosing-a-version).\n\n[Changelog]:https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [BadgerDB](#badgerdb)\n  - [Project Status](#project-status)\n  - [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\n  - [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n    - [Installing](#installing)\n      - [Installing Badger Command Line Tool](#installing-badger-command-line-tool)\n      - [Choosing a version](#choosing-a-version)\n  - [Badger Documentation](#badger-documentation)\n  - [Resources](#resources)\n    - [Blog Posts](#blog-posts)\n  - [Design](#design)\n    - [Comparisons](#comparisons)\n    - [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)\n  - [Projects Using Badger](#projects-using-badger)\n  - [Contributing](#contributing)\n  - [Contact](#contact)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installing\nTo start using Badger, install Go 1.21 or above. Badger v3 and above needs go modules. From your project, run the following command\n\n```sh\n$ go get github.com/dgraph-io/badger/v4\n```\nThis will retrieve the library.\n\n#### Installing Badger Command Line Tool\n\nBadger provides a CLI tool which can perform certain operations like offline backup/restore.  To install the Badger CLI,\nretrieve the repository and checkout the desired version.  Then run\n\n```sh\n$ cd badger\n$ go install .\n```\nThis will install the badger command line utility into your $GOBIN path.\n\n#### Choosing a version\n\nBadgerDB is a pretty special package from the point of view that the most important change we can\nmake to it is not on its API but rather on how data is stored on disk.\n\nThis is why we follow a version naming schema that differs from Semantic Versioning.\n\n- New major versions are released when the data format on disk changes in an incompatible way.\n- New minor versions are released whenever the API changes but data compatibility is maintained.\n Note that the changes on the API could be backward-incompatible - unlike Semantic Versioning.\n- New patch versions are released when there's no changes to the data format nor the API.\n\nFollowing these rules:\n\n- v1.5.0 and v1.6.0 can be used on top of the same files without any concerns, as their major\n version is the same, therefore the data format on disk is compatible.\n- v1.6.0 and v2.0.0 are data incompatible as their major version implies, so files created with\n v1.6.0 will need to be converted into the new format before they can be used by v2.0.0.\n - v2.x.x and v3.x.x are data incompatible as their major version implies, so files created with\n v2.x.x will need to be converted into the new format before they can be used by v3.0.0.\n\n\nFor a longer explanation on the reasons behind using a new versioning naming schema, you can read\n[VERSIONING](VERSIONING.md).\n\n## Badger Documentation\n\nBadger Documentation is available at https://dgraph.io/docs/badger\n\n## Resources\n\n### Blog Posts\n1.

[Concurrent ACID Transactions in Badger](https://open.dgraph.io/post/badger-txn/)\n\n## Design\nBadger was written with these design goals in mind:\n\n- Write a key-value database in pure Go.\n- Use latest research to build the fastest KV database for data sets spanning terabytes.\n- Optimize for SSDs.\n\nBadger\u2019s design is based on a paper titled _[WiscKey: Separating Keys from\nValues in SSD-conscious Storage][wisckey]_.\n\n[wisckey]: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast16/fast16-papers-lu.pdf\n\n### Comparisons\n| Feature                        | Badger                                     | RocksDB                       | BoltDB    |\n| -------                        | ------                                     | -------                       | ------    |\n| Design                         | LSM tree with value log                    | LSM tree only                 | B+ tree   |\n| High Read throughput           | Yes                                        | No                            | Yes       |\n| High Write throughput          | Yes                                        | Yes                           | No        |\n| Designed for SSDs              | Yes (with latest research <sup>1</sup>)    | Not specifically <sup>2</sup> | No        |\n| Embeddable                     | Yes                                        | Yes                           | Yes       |\n| Sorted KV access               | Yes                                        | Yes                           | Yes       |\n| Pure Go (no Cgo)               | Yes                                        | No                            | Yes       |\n| Transactions                   | Yes, ACID, concurrent with SSI<sup>3</sup> | Yes (but non-ACID)            | Yes, ACID |\n| Snapshots                      | Yes                                        | Yes                           | Yes       |\n| TTL support                    | Yes                                        | Yes                           | No        |\n| 3D access (key-value-version)  | Yes<sup>4</sup>                            | No                            | No        |\n\n<sup>1</sup> The [WISCKEY paper][wisckey] (on which Badger is based) saw big\nwins with separating values from keys, significantly reducing the write\namplification compared to a typical LSM tree.\n\n<sup>2</sup> RocksDB is an SSD optimized version of LevelDB, which was designed specifically for rotating disks.\nAs such RocksDB's design isn't aimed at SSDs.\n\n<sup>3</sup> SSI: Serializable Snapshot Isolation. For more details, see the blog post [Concurrent ACID Transactions in Badger](https://blog.dgraph.io/post/badger-txn/)\n\n<sup>4</sup> Badger provides direct access to value versions via its Iterator API.\nUsers can also specify how many versions to keep per key via Options.\n\n### Benchmarks\nWe have run comprehensive benchmarks against RocksDB, Bolt and LMDB. The\nbenchmarking code, and the detailed logs for the benchmarks can be found in the\n[badger-bench] repo. More explanation, including graphs can be found the blog posts (linked\nabove).\n\n[badger-bench]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger-bench\n\n## Projects Using Badger\nBelow is a list of known projects that use Badger:\n\n* [Dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph) - Distributed graph database.\n* [Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) - Distributed tracing platform.\n* [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) - Go client for the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a new hypermedia distribution protocol.\n* [Riot](https://github.com/go-ego/riot) - An open-source, distributed search engine.\n* [emitter](https://github.com/emitter-io/emitter) - Scalable, low latency, distributed pub/sub broker with message storage, uses MQTT, gossip and badger.\n* [OctoSQL](https://github.com/cube2222/octosql) - Query tool that allows you to join, analyse and transform data from multiple databases using SQL.\n* [Dkron](https://dkron.io/) - Distributed, fault tolerant job scheduling system.\n* [smallstep/certificates](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) - Step-ca is an online certificate authority for secure, automated certificate management.\n* [Sandglass](https://github.com/celrenheit/sandglass) - distributed, horizontally scalable, persistent, time sorted message queue.\n* [TalariaDB](https://github.com/grab/talaria) - Grab's Distributed, low latency time-series database.\n* [Sloop](https://github.com/salesforce/sloop) - Salesforce's Kubernetes History Visualization Project.\n* [Usenet Express](https://usenetexpress.com/) - Serving over 300TB of data with Badger.\n* [gorush](https://github.com/appleboy/gorush) - A push notification server written in Go.\n* [0-stor](https://github.com/zero-os/0-stor) - Single device object store.\n* [Dispatch Protocol](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo) - Blockchain protocol for distributed application data analytics.\n* [GarageMQ](https://github.com/valinurovam/garagemq) - AMQP server written in Go.\n* [RedixDB](https://alash3al.github.io/redix/) - A real-time persistent key-value store with the same redis protocol.\n* [BBVA](https://github.com/BBVA/raft-badger) - Raft backend implementation using BadgerDB for Hashicorp raft.\n* [Fantom](https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/go-lachesis) - aBFT Consensus platform for distributed applications.\n* [decred](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) - An open, progressive, and self-funding cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain.\n* [OpenNetSys](https://github.com/opennetsys/c3-go) - Create useful dApps in any software language.\n* [HoneyTrap](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap) - An extensible and opensource system for running, monitoring and managing honeypots.\n* [Insolar](https://github.com/insolar/insolar) - Enterprise-ready blockchain platform.\n* [IoTeX](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core) - The next generation of the decentralized network for IoT powered by scalability- and privacy-centric blockchains.\n* [go-sessions](https://github.com/kataras/go-sessions) - The sessions manager for Go net/http and fasthttp.\n* [Babble](https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble) - BFT Consensus platform for distributed applications.\n* [Tormenta](https://github.com/jpincas/tormenta) - Embedded object-persistence layer / simple JSON database for Go projects.\n* [BadgerHold](https://github.com/timshannon/badgerhold) - An embeddable NoSQL store for querying Go types built on Badger\n* [Goblero](https://github.com/didil/goblero) - Pure Go embedded persistent job queue backed by BadgerDB\n* [Surfline](https://www.surfline.com) - Serving global wave and weather forecast data with Badger.\n* [Cete](https://github.com/mosuka/cete) - Simple and highly available distributed key-value store built on Badger.
