making it unusable for many open source and early-stage commercial projects.\n\nMost MongoDB users do not require any advanced features offered by MongoDB;\nhowever, they need an easy-to-use open-source document database solution.\nRecognizing this, FerretDB is here to fill that gap.\n\n## Scope and current state\n\nFerretDB is compatible with MongoDB drivers and popular MongoDB tools.\nIt functions as a drop-in replacement for MongoDB 5.0+ in many cases.\nFeatures are constantly being added to further increase compatibility and performance.\n\nWe welcome all contributors.\nSee our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FerretDB/projects/2/views/1),\na list of [known differences with MongoDB](https://docs.ferretdb.io/v1.24/diff/),\nand [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Quickstart\n\nRun this command to start FerretDB with PostgreSQL backend:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 ghcr.io/ferretdb/all-in-one\n```\n\nAlternatively, run this command to start FerretDB with SQLite backend:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 -e FERRETDB_HANDLER=sqlite ghcr.io/ferretdb/all-in-one\n```\n\nThis command will start a container with FerretDB, PostgreSQL/SQLite, and MongoDB Shell for quick testing and experiments.\nHowever, it is unsuitable for production use cases because it keeps all data inside and loses it on shutdown.\nSee our [Docker quickstart guide](https://docs.ferretdb.io/v1.24/quickstart-guide/docker/) for instructions\nthat don't have those problems.\n\nWith that container running, you can:\n\n- Connect to it with any MongoDB client application using MongoDB URI `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/`.\n- Connect to it using MongoDB Shell by just running `mongosh`.\n  If you don't have it installed locally, you can run `docker exec -it ferretdb mongosh`.\n- For the PostgreSQL backend, connect to it by running `docker exec -it ferretdb psql -U username ferretdb`.\n  FerretDB uses PostgreSQL schemas for MongoDB databases.\n  So, if you created some collections in the `test` database using any MongoDB client,\n  you can switch to it by running `SET search_path = 'test';` query\n  and see a list of PostgreSQL tables by running `\\d` `psql` command.\n- For the SQLite backend, connect to it by running `docker exec -it ferretdb sqlite3 /state/<database>.sqlite`.\n  So, if you created some collections in the `test` database using any MongoDB client,\n  run `docker exec -it ferretdb sqlite3 /state/test.sqlite`\n  and see a list of SQLite tables by running `.tables` command.\n\nYou can stop the container with `docker stop ferretdb`.\n\nWe also provide binaries and packages for various Linux distributions,\nas well as [Go library package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb) that embeds FerretDB into your application.\nSee [our documentation](https://docs.ferretdb.io/v1.24/quickstart-guide/) for more details.\n\n## Building and packaging\n\n<!-- textlint-disable one-sentence-per-line -->\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> We strongly advise users not to build FerretDB themselves.\n> Instead, use binaries, Docker images, or packages provided by us.\n\n<!-- textlint-enable one-sentence-per-line -->\n\nFerretDB could be built as any other Go program,\nbut a few generated files and build tags could affect it.\nSee [there](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/build/version) for more details.\n\n## Managed FerretDB at cloud providers\n\n- [Civo](https://www.civo.com/marketplace/FerretDB)\n- [Tembo](https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-stacks/mongo-alternative)\n- [Elestio](https://elest.io/open-source/ferretdb)\n- [Cozystack](https://cozystack.io/docs/components/#managed-ferretdb).\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Documentation for users](https://docs.ferretdb.io/).\n- [Documentation for Go developers about embeddable FerretDB](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb).\n\n## Community\n\n- Website and blog: https://www.ferretdb.com/.\n- Twitter: [@ferret_db](https://twitter.com/ferret_db).\n- Mastodon: [@ferretdb@techhub.social](https://techhub.social/@ferretdb).\n- [Slack chat](https://join.slack.com/t/ferretdb/shared_invite/zt-zqe9hj8g-ZcMG3~5Cs5u9uuOPnZB8~A) for quick questions.\n- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/discussions) for longer topics.\n- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/issues) for bugs and missing features.\n- [Open Office Hours meeting](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NGhrZTA5dXZ0MzQzN2gyaGVtZmx2aWxmN2pfMjAyNDA0MDhUMTcwMDAwWiBjX24zN3RxdW9yZWlsOWIwMm0wNzQwMDA3MjQ0QGc&tmsrc=c_n37tquoreil9b02m0740007244%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL)\n  every Monday at 17:00 UTC at [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/mcb-arhw-qbq).\n\nIf you want to contact FerretDB Inc., please use [this form](https://www.ferretdb.com/contact/).\n",
