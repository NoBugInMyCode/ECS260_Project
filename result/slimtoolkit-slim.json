Make Your Containers Better, Smaller, More Secure and Do Less to Get There (free and open source!)\n\nNote that **DockerSlim** is now just **Slim** (**SlimToolkit** is the full name, so it's easier to find it online) to show its growing support for additional container tools and runtimes in the cloud native ecosystem.\n\n**Slim** is now a CNCF Sandbox project. It was created by [Kyle](https://github.com/kcq) [Quest](https://twitter.com/kcqon) and it's been improved by many [contributors](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/graphs/contributors). The project is supported by [Slim.AI](https://slim.ai).\n\n## Overview\n\nSlim allows developers to inspect, optimize and debug their containers using its `xray`, `lint`, `build`, `debug`, `run`, `images`, `merge`, `registry`, `vulnerability` (and other) commands. It simplifies and improves your developer experience building, customizing and using containers. It makes your containers better, smaller and more secure while providing advanced visibility and improved usability working with the original and minified containers.\n\nDon't change anything in your container image and minify it by up to 30x making it secure too! Optimizing images isn't the only thing it can do though. It can also help you understand and author better container images.\n\nKeep doing what you are doing. No need to change anything. Use the base image you want. Use the package manager you want. Don't worry about hand optimizing your Dockerfile. You shouldn't have to throw away your tools and your workflow to have small container images.\n\nDon't worry about manually creating Seccomp and AppArmor security profiles. You shouldn't have to become an expert in Linux syscalls, Seccomp and AppArmor to have secure containers. Even if you do know enough about it wasting time reverse engineering your application behavior can be time-consuming.\n\nSlim will optimize and secure your containers by understanding your application and what it needs using various analysis techniques. It will throw away what you don't need, reducing the attack surface of your container. What if you need some of those extra things to debug your container? You can use dedicated debugging side-car containers for that (more details below).\n\nUnderstand your container image before and after you optimize it using the `xray` command in the `slim` app or the [**Slim.AI SaaS**](https://portal.slim.dev/login?invitecode=invite.1s85zlfnYX0p5TT1XKja49pAHbL) where you can get even more powerful insights including how your container image changed.\n\nSlim has been used with Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, Rust, Elixir and PHP (some app types) running on Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Alpine and even Distroless.\n\nNote that some application stacks do require advanced container probing to make sure that all dynamically loaded components are detected. See the `--http-probe*` flags for more details to know how you can define custom probe commands. In some cases you might also need to use the `--include-path` flag to make sure everything your application needs is included (e.g., `ubuntu.com` python SPA app container image [example](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples/tree/master/3rdparty/ubuntu-com) where the client side template files are explicitly included).\n\nIt's also a good idea to use your app/environment tests when you run the Slim app. See the `--continue-after` flag for more details about integrating your tests with the temporary container Slim creates when it's doing its dynamic analysis. Running tests in the target container is also an option, but it does require you to specify a custom ENTRYPOINT/CMD with a custom wrapper to start your app and to execute your tests.\n\n![Slim How](assets/images/docs/SlimHow.jpeg)\n\nInteractive CLI prompt screencast:\n\n[![asciicast](assets/images/dslim/DockerSlimIntPromptDemo.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/311513)\n\nWatch this screencast to see how an application image is minified by more than 30x.\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/rHqW8cbr3vXe0WxorHsD36n7V.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/rHqW8cbr3vXe0WxorHsD36n7V)\n\nWhen you run the `build` or `profile` commands in Slim it gives you an opportunity to interact with the temporary container it creates. By default, it will pause and wait for your input before it continues its execution. You can change this behavior using the `--continue-after` flag.\n\nIf your application exposes any web interfaces (e.g., when you have a web server or an HTTP API), you'll see the port numbers on the host machine you will need to use to interact with your application (look for the `port.list` and `target.port.info` messages on the screen). For example, in the screencast above you'll see that the internal application port 8000 is mapped to port 32911 on your host.\n\nNote that Slim will interact with your application for you when HTTP probing is enabled (enabled by default; see the `--http-probe*` flag docs for more details). Some web applications built with scripting languages like Python or Ruby require service interactions to load everything in the application. Enable HTTP probing unless it gets in your way.\n\nYou can also interact with the temporary container via a shell script or snippet using `--exec-file` or `--exec`. For example, you can create a container which is only capable of using curl.\n\n```bash\n>> docker pull archlinux:latest\n...\n\n>> slim build --target archlinux:latest --tag archlinux:curl --http-probe=false --exec \"curl checkip.amazonaws.com\"\n...\n\n>> docker run archlinux:curl curl checkip.amazonaws.com\n...\n\n>> docker images\narchlinux                 curl                ...        ...         17.4MB\narchlinux                 latest              ...        ...         467MB\n...\n```\n\n## Community\n\nFeel free to join any of these channels or just open a new [`Github issue`](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/issues) if you want to chat or if you need help.\n\n* [`CNCF Slack channel`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C059QP1RH1S)\n* [`Discord server`](https://discord.gg/9tDyxYS)\n* [`Discussions`](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/discussions)\n* [`Twitter`](https://twitter.com/SlimToolkit)\n\n## Slim on the Internet\n\n##### Books:\n* [`Everyone's Docker/Kubernetes`](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/429710461X) (Japanese)\n* [`Docker in Practice (2nd edition)`](https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Practice-Ian-Miell/dp/1617294802)\n* [`Docker/Kubernetes Security Practice Guide`](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4839970505) (Japanese)\n\n\n## Minification Examples\n\nYou can find the examples in a separate repository: [https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples)\n\nNode.js application images:\n\n- from ubuntu:14.04 -

Download the zip package for your platform.\n\n   - [Latest Mac binaries](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_mac.zip) (`curl -L -o ds.zip https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_mac.zip`)\n\n   - [Latest Mac M1 binaries](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_mac_m1.zip) (`curl -L -o ds.zip https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_mac_m1.zip)`)\n\n   - [Latest Linux binaries](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_linux.tar.gz) (`curl -L -o ds.tar.gz https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_linux.tar.gz`)\n\n   - [Latest Linux ARM binaries](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_linux_arm.tar.gz) (`curl -L -o ds.tar.gz https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_linux_arm.tar.gz`)\n\n   - [Latest Linux ARM64 binaries](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_linux_arm64.tar.gz) (`curl -L -o ds.tar.gz https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_linux_arm64.tar.gz`)\n\n2. Unzip the package and optionally move it to your bin directory.\n\nLinux (for non-intel replace `dist_linux` with the platform-specific extracted path):\n```\ntar -xvf ds.tar.gz\nmv  dist_linux/slim /usr/local/bin/\nmv  dist_linux/slim-sensor /usr/local/bin/\n```\nMac:\n```\nunzip ds.zip\nmv  dist_mac/slim /usr/local/bin/\nmv  dist_mac/slim-sensor /usr/local/bin/\n```\n\n3. Add the location where you unzipped the package to your PATH environment variable (optional).\n\nIf the directory where you extracted the binaries is not in your PATH then you'll need to run your Slim app binary from that directory.\n\n#### Scripted Install\n\nYou can also use this script to install the current release of Slim on Linux (x86 and ARM) and macOS (x86 and Apple Silicon)\n\n```bash\ncurl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slimtoolkit/slim/master/scripts/install-slim.sh | sudo -E bash -\n```\n\n### Homebrew\n\n```\nbrew install docker-slim\n```\n\nThe Homebrew installer: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/docker-slim\n\n### Docker\n\n```\ndocker pull dslim/slim\n```\n\nSee the [RUNNING CONTAINERIZED](#running-containerized) section for more usage info.\n\n### SaaS\n\nPowered by Slim. It will help you understand and troubleshoot your application containers and a lot more. If you use the `xray` command you'll want to try the SaaS. Understanding image changes is easy with its container diff capabilities. Connect your own registry and you can do the same with your own containers. Try it [here](https://portal.slim.dev/login?invitecode=invite.1s85zlfnYX0p5TT1XKja49pAHbL) without installing anything locally.\n\n\n## BASIC USAGE INFO\n\n`slim [global flags] [xray|build|profile|run|debug|lint|merge|images|registry|vulnerability|update|version|appbom|help] [command-specific flags] <IMAGE_ID_OR_NAME>`\n\nIf you don't specify any command `slim` will start in the interactive prompt mode.\n\n### COMMANDS\n\n- `xray` - Performs static analysis for the target container image (including 'reverse engineering' the Dockerfile for the image). Use this command if you want to know what's inside of your container image and what makes it fat.\n- `lint` - Analyzes container instructions in Dockerfiles (Docker image support is WIP)\n- `build` - Analyzes, profiles and optimizes your container image generating the supported security profiles. This is the most popular command.\n- `debug` - Debug the running target container. This command is useful for troubleshooting running containers created from minimal/minified or regular container images.\n- `registry` - Execute registry operations (`pull`, `push`, `copy`, `server`).\n- `profile` - Performs basic container image analysis and dynamic container analysis, but it doesn't generate an optimized image.\n- `run` - Runs one or more containers (for now runs a single container similar to `docker run`)\n- `merge` - Merge two container images (optimized to merge minified images).\n- `images` - Get information about container images (example: `slim --quiet images`).\n- `vulnerability` - Execute vulnerability related tools and operations (`epss`).\n- `version` - Shows the version information.\n- `appbom` - Shows the application BOM (app composition/dependencies).\n- `update` - Updates Slim to the latest version.\n- `help` - Show the available commands and global flags\n\nExample: `slim build my/sample-app`\n\nSee the `USAGE DETAILS` section for more details. Run `slim help` to get a high level overview of the available commands. Run `slim COMMAND_NAME` without any parameters and you'll get more information about that command (e.g., `slim build`).\n\nIf you run `slim` without any parameters you'll get an interactive prompt that will provide suggestions about the available commands and flags. `Tabs` are used to show the available options, to autocomplete the parameters and to navigate the option menu (which you can also do with Up and Down arrows). `Spaces` are used to move to the next parameter and `Enter` is used to run the command. For more info about the interactive prompt see [`go-prompt`](https://github.com/c-bata/go-prompt).\n\n## USAGE DETAILS\n\n`slim [global options] command [command options] <target image ID or name>`\n\nCommands:\n\n- `xray` - Show what's in the container image and reverse engineer its Dockerfile\n- `lint` - Lint the target Dockerfile (or image, in the future)\n- `build` - Analyze the target container image along with its application and build an optimized image from it\n- `debug` - Debug the running target container.

See the [HostConfig](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient#HostConfig) struct definition from the `go-dockerclient` package for configuration details. Note that Slim will automatically add `SYS_ADMIN` to the list of capabilities and run the container in privileged mode, which are required to generate the seccomp profiles. The host config parameters specified using their standalone build or profile command flags overwrite the values in the host config file (volume binds are merged).\n- `--cro-sysctl` - Set namespaced kernel parameters in the created container (Container Runtime Option).\n- `--cro-shm-size` - Shared memory size for /dev/shm in the created container (Container Runtime Option).\n- `--use-local-mounts` - Mount local paths for target container artifact input and output (off, by default)\n- `--use-sensor-volume` - Sensor volume name to use (set it to your Docker volume name if you manage your own Slim sensor volume).\n- `--keep-tmp-artifacts` - Keep temporary artifacts when command is done (off, by default).\n- `--keep-perms` - Keep artifact permissions as-is (default: true)\n- `--run-target-as-user` - Run target app (in the temporary container) as USER from Dockerfile (true, by default)\n- `--new-entrypoint` - New ENTRYPOINT instruction for the optimized image\n- `--new-cmd` - New CMD instruction for the optimized image\n- `--new-expose` - New EXPOSE instructions for the optimized image\n- `--new-workdir` - New WORKDIR instruction for the optimized image\n- `--new-env` - New ENV instructions for the optimized image\n- `--new-label` - New LABEL instructions for the optimized image\n- `--new-volume` - New VOLUME instructions for the optimized image\n- `--remove-volume` - Remove VOLUME instructions for the optimized image\n- `--remove-env` - Remove ENV instructions for the optimized image\n- `--remove-label` - Remove LABEL instructions for the optimized image\n- `--remove-expose` - Remove EXPOSE instructions for the optimized image\n- `--exec` - A shell script snippet to run via Docker exec\n- `--exec-file` - A shell script file to run via Docker exec\n- `--sensor-ipc-mode` - Select sensor IPC mode: proxy | direct (useful for containerized CI/CD environments)\n- `--sensor-ipc-endpoint` - Override sensor IPC endpoint\n- `--rta-onbuild-base-image` - Enable runtime analysis for onbuild base images (default: false)\n- `--rta-source-ptrace` - Enable PTRACE runtime analysis source (default: true)\n- `--image-build-engine` - Select image build engine: `internal` | `docker` | `none` (`internal` - build the output image without using Docker [default behavior], `docker` - build the output image with Docker, `none` - don't build the output image, allows you to do your own build with the tools you want to use, which you'll be able to do by pointing to the artifact directory where the `files.tar` and `Dockerfile` artifacts are located for the output image)\n- `--image-build-arch` - Select output image build architecture (use the standard container image names for the architectures without the OS part)\n- `--obfuscate-metadata` - Obfuscate the standard system and application metadata to make it more challenging to identify the image components (experimental flag, first version of obfuscation; inspired by the [`Malicious Compliance`](https://kccnceu2023.sched.com/event/1Hybu/malicious-compliance-reflections-on-trusting-container-scanners-ian-coldwater-independent-duffie-cooley-isovalent-brad-geesaman-ghost-security-rory-mccune-datadog) KubeCon EU 2023 talk)\n- `--enable-mondel` - Enable monitor data event log for sensor monitors to log/stream the events captured by those monitors (default: false)\n\nIn the interactive CLI prompt mode you must specify the target image using the `--target` flag while in the traditional CLI mode you can use the `--target` flag or you can specify the target image as the last value in the command.\n\nThe `--include-path` option is useful if you want to customize your minified image adding extra files and directories. The `--include-path-file` option allows you to load multiple includes from a newline delimited file. Use this option if you have a lot of includes. The includes from `--include-path` and `--include-path-file` are combined together. You can also use the `--exclude-pattern` flag to control what shouldn't be included.\n\nThe `--continue-after` option is useful if you need to script the Slim app. If you pick the `probe` option then Slim will continue executing the build command after the HTTP probe is done executing. If you pick the `exec` options then Slim will continue executing the build command after the container exec shell commands (specified using the `--exec-file` or `--exec` flags) are done executing. If you pick the `timeout` option Slim will allow the target container to run for 60 seconds before it will attempt to collect the artifacts. You can specify a custom timeout value by passing a number of seconds you need instead of the `timeout` string. If you pick the `signal` option you'll need to send a `USR1` signal to the Slim app process. The `signal` option is useful when you want to run your own tests against the temporary container Slim creates. Your test automation / CI/CD pipeline will be able to notify the Slim app that it's done running its test by sending the `USR1` to it.\n\nYou can also combine multiple `continue-after` modes. For now only combining `probe` and `exec` is supported (using either `probe&exec` or `exec&probe` as the `--continue-after` flag value). Other combinations may work too. Combining `probe` and `signal` is not supported.\n\nThe `--include-shell` option provides a simple way to keep a basic shell in the minified container. Not all shell commands are included. To get additional shell commands or other command line utilities use the `--include-exe` and/or `--include-bin` options. Note that the extra apps and binaries might missed some of the non-binary dependencies (which don't get picked up during static analysis). For those additional dependencies use the `--include-path` and `--include-path-file` options.\n\nThe `--dockerfile` option makes it possible to build a new minified image directly from source Dockerfile. Pass the Dockerfile name as the value for this flag and pass the build context directory or URL instead of the docker image name as the last parameter for the `build` command: `slim build --dockerfile Dockerfile --tag my/custom_minified_image_name .` If you want to see the console output from the build stages (when the fat and slim images are built) add the `--show-blogs` build flag. Note that the build console output is not interactive and it's printed only after the corresponding build step is done. The fat image created during the build process has the `.fat` suffix in its name. If you specify a custom image tag (with the `--tag` flag) the `.fat` suffix is added to the name part of the tag. If you don't provide a custom tag the generated fat image name will have the following format: `slim-tmp-fat-image.<pid_of_slim>.<current_timestamp>`. The minified image name will have the `.slim` suffix added to that auto-generated container image name (`slim-tmp-fat-image.<pid_of_slim>.<current_timestamp>.slim`). Take a look at this [python examples](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples/tree/master/python_ubuntu_18_py27_from_dockerfile) to see how it's using the `--dockerfile` flag.\n\nThe `--use-local-mounts` option is used to choose how the Slim sensor is added to the target container and how the sensor artifacts are delivered back to the master. If you enable this option you'll get the original Slim app behavior where it uses local file system volume mounts to add the sensor executable and to extract the artifacts from the target container. This option doesn't always work as expected in the dockerized environment where Slim itself is running in a Docker container. When this option is disabled (default behavior) then a separate Docker volume is used to mount the sensor and the sensor artifacts are explicitly copied from the target container.\n\n### `DEBUG` COMMAND OPTIONS\n\n- `--runtime` - Runtime environment type (values: `docker`, `k8s`; defaults to `docker`)\n- `--debug-image` - Debug image to use for the debug side-car container (default value for this flag is `busybox`).\n- `--list-debug-images` - List possible debug images to use for the debug side-car container (for the `--debug-image` flag).

The `--as` flag is a convenient way to tag the image while you are pushing it. Here's an example pushing a local Docker `nginx` image to a local registry: `slim registry push --docker nginx --as localhost:5000/nginx`\n\nYou can create a local registry using the `server` subcommand. See the `server` sub-command section below for more details.\n\n#### `COPY` SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS\n\nUSAGE: `slim registry copy [SRC_IMAGE] [DST_IMAGE]`\n\nNOTE: Just a placeholder for now (TBD)\n\n#### `IMAGE-INDEX-CREATE` SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS\n\nUSAGE: `slim registry image-index-create --image-index-name [MULTI-ARCH_IMAGE_TAG] --image-name [IMAGE_ONE] --image-name [IMAGE_TWO]`\n\nFlags: \n\n- `--image-index-name` - Image index name to use.\n- `--image-name` - Target image name to include in image index.\n- `--as-manifest-list` - Create image index with the manifest list media type instead of the default OCI image index type.\n- `--dump-raw-manifest` - Dump raw manifest for the created image index.\n- `--insecure-refs` - Allow the referenced images from insecure registry connections.\n\n#### `SERVER` SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS\n\nStarts a server which implements the [OCI API spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/v1.0.1/spec.md) on port 5000 by default.\n\nUSAGE: `slim [GLOBAL FLAGS] registry server [FLAGS]`\n\nFlags:\n\n- `--address` - Registry server address to listen on (default: `0.0.0.0`)\n- `--port` - Registry server port (default: 5000)\n- `--https` - Use HTTPS.\n- `--cert-path` - Cert path for use with HTTPS (for use when not using autocert).\n- `--key-path` - Key path for use with HTTPS (for use when not using autocert).\n- `--domain` - Domain to use for registry server (to get certs).

It will try to detect if it's running in a containerized environment, but you can also tell Slim explicitly using the `--in-container` global flag.\n\nYou can run Slim in your container directly or you can use the Slim container image in your containerized environment. If you are using the Slim container image make sure you run it configured with the Docker IPC information, so it can communicate with the Docker daemon. The most common way to do it is by mounting the Docker unix socket to the Slim app container. Some containerized environments (like Gitlab and their `dind` service) might not expose the Docker unix socket to you, so you'll need to make sure the environment variables used to communicate with Docker (e.g., `DOCKER_HOST`) are passed to the Slim app container. Note that if those environment variables reference any kind of local host names those names need to be replaced or you need to tell the Slim app about them using the `--etc-hosts-map` flag. If those environment variables reference local files those local files (e.g., files for TLS cert validation) will need to be copied to a temporary container, so that temporary container can be used as a data container to make those files accessible by the Slim app container.\n\nWhen Slim app runs in a container it will attempt to save its execution state in a separate Docker volume. If the volume doesn't exist it will try to create it (`slim-state`, by default). You can pick a different state volume or disable this behavior completely by using the global `--archive-state` flag. If you do want to persist the Slim app execution state (which includes the `seccomp` and `AppArmor` profiles) without using the state archiving feature you can mount your own volume that maps to the `/bin/.slim-state` directory in the Slim app container.\n\nBy default, the Slim app will try to create a Docker volume for its sensor unless one already exists. If this behavior is not supported by your containerized environment you can create a volume separately and pass its name to the Slim app using the `--use-sensor-volume` flag.\n\nHere's a basic example of how to use the containerized version of the Slim app:\n`docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock dslim/slim build your-docker-image-name`\n\nHere's a GitLab example for their `dind` `.gitlab-ci.yml` config file:\n`docker run -e DOCKER_HOST=tcp://$(grep docker /etc/hosts | cut -f1):2375 dslim/slim build your-docker-image-name`\n\nHere's a CircleCI example for their `remote docker` `.circleci/config.yml` config file (used after the `setup_remote_docker` step):\n\n```bash\ndocker create -v /dcert_path --name dcert alpine:latest /bin/true\ndocker cp $DOCKER_CERT_PATH/. dcert:/dcert_path\ndocker run --volumes-from dcert -e DOCKER_HOST=$DOCKER_HOST -e DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=$DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY -e DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/dcert_path dslim/slim build your-docker-image-name\n```\n\nDifferent CI/CD services have different containerized environment designs that impose various restrictions that may impact the ability of the main app to communicate with the sensor app embedded in the temporary container Slim creates. Try adjusting the values for the `--sensor-ipc-mode` and `--sensor-ipc-endpoint` flags. This [`Google Cloud Build`](https://medium.com/google-cloud/integrating-dockerslim-container-minify-step-on-cloud-build-64da29fd58d1) blog post by M\u00e1rton Kodok is a good reference for both of those flags. \n\n### Using `*-file` Flags\n- There are several flags that accept file paths (`--include-path-file`, `--compose-file`, `--http-probe-cmd-file`, etc). You need volume mount the location of the referenced paths or the file paths themselves when you use the containerized version of Slim because the Slim app container won't have accept to the referenced files otherwise.\n\n## CI/CD INTEGRATIONS\n\n### Integrating Slim in Jenkins\n#### Prerequisites:\n- Spin up a virtual machine(e.g.EC2 Instance, Azure VM, GCE) which has an Ubuntu OS via your desired cloud platform(AWS, Azure, GCP), SSH into the machine, update the machine packages and install docker. An example of this step is highlighted below given you are running an AWS EC2 Instance.\n```\nsudo apt update -y\n```\n```\nsudo apt install docker -y\n```\n```\nsudo systemctl start docker\n```\n```\nsudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user\n```\n- Install Jenkins on the virtual machine using docker as stipulated by the [Jenkins Documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/README.md), this step pulls [Jenkins Image from DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins), runs Jenkins as a container via port 8080 and creates an explicit docker volume on the host machine to retain Jenkins data. Given you are running an AWS EC2 Instance, create a TCP rule with port 8080 in the Instance security group rules which allows only your Internet Protocol(IP) address to access the Jenkins server. \n```\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -d -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts\n```\n- Given Jenkins is now running as a containerized environment in the virtual machine, you need to make docker available in the Jenkins container, you can do this by bind mounting the virtual machine docker unix socket onto the jenkins container, note that to carry out this step you need to stop the running jenkins container, you can find the jenkins container ID by using the docker ps command, the commands to execute are highlighted below. This step is essential as it makes docker available in the Jenkins container, and with docker you can pull Slim Image which is to be used in further steps.\n```\ndocker ps \n```\n```\ndocker stop [jenkins_container_id]\n```\n```\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -d \\  \n-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \\ \n-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ \n-v $(which docker):/usr/bin/docker jenkins/jenkins:lts\n```\n- Enable Docker permissions in the new jenkins container, such that Jenkins can perform docker commands and pull the [Slim Official Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dslim/docker-slim) in the container. To do this, you need to get into the Jenkins container as a root user, you can find the jenkins container ID by using the docker ps command, the commands to execute are highlighted below:\n```\ndocker exec -u 0 -it [jenkins_container_id] bash\n```\n```\nchmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock \n```\n```\ndocker pull dslim/slim\n```\n#### Jenkinsfile Slim Stage\nGiven you have completed the prerequisite steps above, you can build a docker image and minify the image size using Slim via the snippet stage below which should be highlighted in your Jenkinsfile stages.\n```\nstage(\"Build and Slim Docker Image\") {\n  steps {\n      script {\n          echo \"building and slimming docker image...\"\n          sh 'docker build -t IMAGE_NAME:$BUILD_NUMBER .'\n          sh 'docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock dslim/slim \\\n              build --target IMAGE_NAME:$BUILD_NUMBER --tag IMAGE_NAME:slim-$BUILD_NUMBER \\\n              exit'\n      }\n  }\n}\n```\n- The snippet stage above allows for customization, you should replace the image name--IMAGE_NAME with your desired image name, the environment variable tag--$BUILD_NUMBER represents a unique incremental number allocated by Jenkins each time your jenkins pipeline runs. \n- The docker build command builds a Docker Image of your application from a Dockerfile.\n- The docker run command runs Slim in a non-interactive mode via the docker unix socket, minifies the built(target) image--IMAGE_NAME:$BUILD_NUMBER, and adjusting it to a new slimmed image with the image/tag--IMAGE_NAME:slim-$BUILD_NUMBER.\n- You should put the Slim stage before a docker tag/push stage and after a build/test artifact in your Jenkinsfile, an example pipeline is highlighted below for a sample nodejs application; The first stage test and builds an artifact of the application; The second stage builds a docker image and a slimmed version of the docker image; The third stage tags the slimmed docker image with a DockerHub account remote repository and pushes the image to the remote repository.\n```\npipeline {\n    agent any\n    stages {\n        stage(\"building nodejs app\") {\n            steps{\n                script {\n                    echo \"building nodejs app...\"\n                    sh 'npm run test'\n                    sh 'npm pack'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        stage(\"Build and Slim Docker Image\") {\n            steps {\n                script {\n                    echo \"building and slimming docker image...\"\n                    sh 'docker build -t node_alpine:$BUILD_NUMBER .'\n                    sh 'docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock dslim/slim \\\n                        build --target node_alpine:$BUILD_NUMBER --tag node_alpine:slim-$BUILD_NUMBER \\\n                        exit'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        stage(\"Push Slim Image to Regristy\") {\n            steps {\n                script {\n                    echo 'pushing image to docker regristry...'\n                    withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'docker-hub-credentials', passwordVariable: 'PASS', usernameVariable: 'USER')]) {\n                        sh 'docker tag node_alpine:slim-$BUILD_NUMBER $USER/node_alpine:slim-$BUILD_NUMBER'\n                        sh 'echo $PASS | docker login -u $USER --password-stdin'\n                        sh 'docker push $USER/node_alpine:slim-$BUILD_NUMBER'\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}   \n```\n\n### Integrating Slim in Github Actions\n#### Docker-Slim Github Action\nIntegrating Slim in Github Actions in your CI/CD workflow involves using the [Docker-Slim Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-slim-github-action), this Action(snippet below) minifies a target docker image--IMAGE_NAME:latest in your workflow, making it smaller and adjusting the new slimmed image as IMAGE_NAME:slim.  \n```\n# Slim it!\n- uses: kitabisa/docker-slim-action@v1\n  env:\n    DSLIM_HTTP_PROBE: false\n  with:\n    target: IMAGE_NAME:latest\n    tag: \"slim\"\n```\n#### Github Actions Slim Workflow\nYou can integrate the Docker-Slim Github Action in your workflow by inserting the Action after a [Docker Build/Push Github Action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action), before [Docker Login Github Action](https://github.com/docker/login-action) and docker tag/push commands, a customized example workflow is highlighted below. Note that the environment variable tag--{{github.run_number}} in the workflow represents a unique incremental number allocated by Github Actions each time your workflow runs.\n```\n# Build the Docker image first\n- uses: docker/build-push-action@v4\n  with:\n    push: false\n    tags: IMAGE_NAME:{{github.run_number}} \n\n# Slim the Image\n- uses: kitabisa/docker-slim-action@v1\n  env:\n    DSLIM_HTTP_PROBE: false\n  with:\n    target: IMAGE_NAME:{{github.run_number}}\n    tag: \"slim-{{github.run_number}}\"\n\n# Docker Hub Login\n  uses: docker/login-action@v2\n  with:\n    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}\n    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n# Push to the registry\n- run: | \n   docker tag IMAGE_NAME:slim-{{github.run_number}} ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/IMAGE_NAME:slim-{{github.run_number}}\n   docker push ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/IMAGE_NAME:slim-{{github.run_number}}\n```\nThe workflow above indicates four steps:\n- A [Docker Build/Push Github Action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action) for building a docker image with the image name/tag--IMAGE_NAME:{{github.run_number}}, you should give replace IMAGE_NAME with your desired image name. Note that this Action must have a false option to push the built image--given that you need the image slimmed/minified before pushing it to a container registry. \n- A Docker-Slim Github Action which minifies the target image--IMAGE_NAME:{{github.run_number}}, this Action has the \"slim-{{github.run_number}}\" tag and adds this tag to the slimmed/minified docker image such that the image name/tag becomes IMAGE_NAME:slim-{{github.run_number}}.\n- A Docker Login Github Action which logs into your DockerHub container regristry account, you should store your DockerHub username and personal access token as secrets in the github repository meant for the workflow. Suppose your container registry is not DockerHub, you can check the [Docker Login Github Action documentation](https://github.com/docker/login-action) for the use case of logging into your desired container registry. \n- A docker tag command for naming/tagging the slimmed image with your DockerHub account remote repository name which could be the same name(IMAGE_NAME) as the slimmed image; A docker push command to push the slimmed image to your Dockerhub account remote repository.\n\n\n## DOCKER CONNECT OPTIONS\n\nIf you don't specify any Docker connect options the Slim app expects to find the Docker Unix socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) or the following environment variables: `DOCKER_HOST`, `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` (optional), `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` (required if `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` is set to `\"1\"`). Note that the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable can be used to point to a Unix socket address (in case the default Unix socket isn't there). This is useful when you use Docker Desktop and you haven't configured Docker Desktop to create the default Unix socket.\n\nIf the Docker environment variables are configured to use TLS and to verify the Docker cert (default behavior), but you want to disable the TLS verification you can override the TLS verification behavior by setting the `--tls-verify` to false:\n\n`slim --tls-verify=false build my/sample-node-app-multi`\n\nYou can override all Docker connection options using these flags: `--host`, `--tls`, `--tls-verify`, `--tls-cert-path`. These flags correspond to the standard Docker options (and the environment variables). Note that you can also use the `--host` flag (similar to `DOCKER_HOST`) to point to a Unix socket (e.g., `--host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock`).\n\nIf you want to use TLS with verification:\n\n`slim --host=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376 --tls-cert-path=/Users/youruser/.docker/machine/machines/default --tls=true --tls-verify=true build my/sample-node-app-multi`\n\nIf you want to use TLS without verification:\n\n`slim --host=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376 --tls-cert-path=/Users/youruser/.docker/machine/machines/default --tls=true --tls-verify=false build my/sample-node-app-multi`\n\nIf the Docker environment variables are not set and if you don't specify any Docker connect options Slim will try to use the default unix socket.\n\n### DOCKER DESKTOP\n\nYou may not have the default Unix socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) configured if you use Docker Desktop. By default, Docker Desktop uses `~/.docker/run/docker.sock` as the Unix socket.\n\nYou can either use `--host` or `DOCKER_HOST` to point to the Docker Desktop's Unix socket or you can configure Docker Desktop to create the default/traditional Unix socket (creating the `/var/run/docker.sock` symlink manually is an option too).\n\nTo configure Docker Desktop to create the default Unix socket open its UI and go to `Settings -> Advanced` where you need to check the `Enable default Docker socket (Requires password)` option.\n\n## HTTP PROBE COMMANDS\n\nIf the HTTP probe is enabled (note: it is enabled by default) it will default to running `GET /` with HTTP and then HTTPS on every exposed port. You can add additional commands using the `--http-probe-cmd` and `--http-probe-cmd-file` options.\n\nIf you want to disable HTTP probing set the `--http-probe` flag to false (e.g., `--http-probe=false`). You can also use the `--http-probe-off` flag to do the same (simply use the flag without any parameters).\n\nThe `--http-probe-cmd` option is good when you want to specify a small number of simple commands where you select some or all of these HTTP command options: crawling (defaults to false), protocol, method (defaults to GET), resource (path and query string).\n\nIf you only want to use custom HTTP probe command and you don't want the default `GET /` command added to the command list you explicitly provided you'll need to set `--http-probe` to false when you specify your custom HTTP probe command. Note that this inconsistency will be addressed in the future releases to make it less confusing.\n\nPossible field combinations:\n* `/path` - runs `GET /path`\n* `crawl:/path` - runs `GET /path` and then crawls the pages referenced by the target page\n* `post:/path` - runs `POST /path`\n* `crawl:get:/path` - runs `GET /path` and then crawls the pages referenced by the target page\n* `https:get:/path` runs `GET /path` only on https\n* `crawl:http:get:/path` - runs `GET /path` and then crawls the pages referenced by the target page\n\nHere are a couple of examples:\n\nAdds two extra probe commands: `GET /api/info` and `POST /submit` (tries http first, then tries https):\n`slim build --show-clogs --http-probe-cmd /api/info --http-probe-cmd POST:/submit my/sample-node-app-multi`\n\nAdds one extra probe command: `POST /submit` (using only http):\n`slim build --show-clogs --http-probe-cmd http:POST:/submit my/sample-node-app-multi`\n\nThe `--http-probe-cmd-file` option is good when you have a lot of commands and/or you want to select additional HTTP command options.\n\nAvailable HTTP command options:\n* `method` - HTTP method to use\n* `resource` - target resource URL\n* `port` - port number\n* `protocol` - `http`, `https`, `http2`, `http2c` (cleartext version of http2), `ws`, `wss` (secure websocket)\n* `headers` - array of strings with column delimited key/value pairs (e.g., \"Content-Type: application/json\")\n* `body` - request body as a string\n* `body_file` - request body loaded from the provided file\n* `username` - username to use for basic auth\n* `password` - password to use for basic auth\n* `crawl` - boolean to indicate if you want to crawl the target (to visit all referenced resources)\n\nHere's a probe command file example:\n\n`slim build --show-clogs --http-probe-cmd-file probeCmds.json my/sample-node-app-multi`\n\nCommands in `probeCmds.json`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"commands\":\n  [\n   {\n     \"resource\": \"/api/info\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"method\": \"POST\",\n     \"resource\": \"/submit\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"procotol\": \"http\",\n     \"resource\": \"/api/call?arg=one\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"protocol\": \"http\",\n     \"method\": \"POST\",\n     \"resource\": \"/submit2\",\n     \"body\": \"key=value\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"protocol\": \"http\",\n     \"method\": \"POST\",\n     \"resource\": \"/submit3\",\n     \"body_file\": \"mydata.json\",\n     \"headers\": [\"Content-Type: application/json\"]\n   }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe HTTP probe command file path can be a relative path (relative to the current working directory) or it can be an absolute path.\n\nFor each HTTP probe call Slim will print the call status. Example: `info=http.probe.call status=200 method=GET target=http://127.0.0.1:32899/ attempt=1 error=none`.\n\nYou can execute your own external HTTP requests using the `target.port.list` field in the container info message Slim prints when it starts its test container: `slim[build]: info=container name=<your_container_name> id=<your_container_id> target.port.list=[<comma_separated_list_of_port_numbers_to_use>] target.port.info=[<comma_separated_list_of_port_mapping_records>]`. Example: `slim[build]: info=container name=slimk_42861_20190203084955 id=aa44c43bcf4dd0dae78e2a8b3ac011e7beb6f098a65b09c8bce4a91dc2ff8427 target.port.list=[32899] target.port.info=[9000/tcp => 0.0.0.0:32899]`. With this information you can run `curl` or other HTTP request generating tools: `curl http://localhost:32899`.\n\nThe current version also includes an experimental `crawling` capability. To enable it for the default HTTP probe use the `--http-probe-crawl` flag. You can also enable it for the HTTP probe commands in your command file using the `crawl` boolean field.\n\nWhen `crawling` is enabled the HTTP probe will act like a web crawler following the links it finds in the target endpoint.\n\nProbing based on the Swagger/OpenAPI spec is another experimental capability. This feature introduces two new flags:\n* `http-probe-apispec` - value: `<path_to_fetch_spec>:<api_endpoint_prefix>`\n* `http-probe-apispec-file` - value: `<local_file_path_to_spec>`\n\nYou can use the `--http-probe-exec` and `--http-probe-exec-file` options to run the user provided commands when the http probes are executed. This example shows how you can run `curl` against the temporary container created by Slim when the http probes are executed.\n\n`slim build --http-probe-exec 'curl http://localhost:YOUR_CONTAINER_PORT_NUM/some/path' --publish-port YOUR_CONTAINER_PORT_NUM your-container-image-name`\n\n\n## DEBUGGING MINIFIED CONTAINERS\n\n### Debugging Using the `debug` Command\n\nThe current version of the `debug` command is pretty basic and it lacks a number of useful capabilities. It will help you debug containers running in Docker or Kubernetes (use the `--runtime` flag and set it to `k8s` if you need to debug a container in Kubernetes). \n\nBy default the `debug` command will provide you with an interactive terminal when it attaches the debugger side-car image to the debugged target container. Future versions will allow you to have different interaction modes with the target.\n\n#### The Debug Images\n\nYou can use any container image as a debug image, but there's a list of pre-selected debug images you can choose.\n\nYou can list all pre-selected debug images with the `--list-debug-images` and if you are using the interactive prompt mode there'll be an auto-complete dropdown menu for the `--debug-image` flag.\n\nHere's the current list of debug images:\n\n* `cgr.dev/chainguard/slim-toolkit-debug:latest` - a general purpose SlimToolkit debug image created by Chainguard\n* `cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base:latest` - a basic lightweight Wolfi image\n* `busybox:latest` - a lightweight image with common unix utilities\n* `nicolaka/netshoot` - a network trouble-shooting swiss-army container\n* `lightruncom/koolkits:node` - a debug image for Node.js applications\n* `lightruncom/koolkits:python` - a debug image for Python applications\n* `lightruncom/koolkits:golang` - a debug image for Go applications\n* `lightruncom/koolkits:jvm` - a debug image for Java applications\n* `digitalocean/doks-debug:latest` - a kubernetes troubleshooting debug image\n* `public.ecr.aws/zinclabs/debug-ubuntu-base:latest` - an image with common debugging utilities \n\n#### Steps to Debug Your Container (Kubernetes Runtime)\n\n1. Make sure the target environment you want to debug is up (the example k8s manifest creates a pod with the minimal nginx image from Chainguard and it has no shell):\n```bash\n\n>> kubectl apply -f examples/k8s_nginx_cgr/manifest.yaml\n\n```\n2. Run the debug command:\n\n```bash\n\n>> slim debug --runtime=k8s --pod=example-pod example-container\n\n```\nor\n```bash\n\n>> slim debug --runtime=k8s --pod=example-pod --target=example-container\n\n```\n\nNow you should have an interactive shell into the debug container started by `slim` and you can type your regular shell commands.\n\nBy default the `debug` command will connect the interactive terminal to the debugged container and it will run a shell as if it's running in the target container environment, so you will see the file system of the target container as if you are directly connected (you won't have to go through the `proc` file system). You can change this behavior by using the `--run-as-target-shell` (which is true by default). For example, this call will connect you to the debug container in a more traditional way: `slim debug --runtime=k8s --run-as-target-shell=false example-container`\n\nAlso note that if you use the interactive `prompt` mode (when you run `slim` with no command line parameters) you will get auto-complete behavior for a number of flags: `--target`, `--namespace`, `--pod`, `--session`.\n\nEach time you try to debug an image `slim` will have a session that represents it. You'll be able to reconnect to the existing active debug sessions and you'll be able to get logs from all available sessions.\n\n#### Steps to Debug Your Container (Docker Runtime) \n\n1. Start the target container you want to debug:\n```bash\n\n>> docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 --name mycontainer nginx\n\n```\n2. Run the debug command:\n\n```bash\n\n>> slim debug mycontainer\n\n```\nor\n```bash\n\n>> slim debug --target=mycontainer\n\n```\n\nNow you should have an interactive shell into the debug container started by `slim` and you can type your regular shell commands.\n\nBy default the `debug` command will connect the interactive terminal to the debugged container and it will run a shell as if it's running in the target container environment, so you will see the file system of the target container as if you are directly connected (you won't have to go through the `proc` file system). You can change this behavior by using the `--run-as-target-shell` (which is true by default). For example, this call will connect you to the debug container in a more traditional way: `slim debug --run-as-target-shell=false mycontainer`\n\nAlso note that if you use the interactive `prompt` mode (when you run `slim` with no command line parameters) you will get auto-complete behavior for a number of flags: `--target`, `--session`.\n\nEach time you try to debug an image `slim` will have a session that represents it. You'll be able to reconnect to the existing active debug sessions and you'll be able to get logs from all available sessions.\n\n### Debugging the \"Hard Way\" (Docker Runtime)\n\nYou can create dedicated debugging side-car container images loaded with the tools you need for debugging target containers. This allows you to keep your production container images small. The debugging side-car containers attach to the running target containers.\n\nAssuming you have a running container named `node_app_alpine` you can attach your debugging side-car with a command like this: `docker run --rm -it --pid=container:node_app_alpine --net=container:node_app_alpine --cap-add sys_admin alpine sh`. In this example, the debugging side-car is a regular alpine image. This is exactly what happens with the `node_alpine` app sample (located in the `node_alpine` directory of the `examples` repo) and the `run_debug_sidecar.command` helper script.\n\nIf you run the `ps` command in the side-car you'll see the application from the target container:\n\n```\n# ps\nPID   USER     TIME   COMMAND\n    1 root       0:00 node /opt/my/service/server.js\n   13 root       0:00 sh\n   38 root       0:00 ps\n```\n\nYou can access the target container file system through `/proc/<TARGET_PID>/root`:\n\n```\n# ls -lh /proc/1/root/opt/my/service\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 root     root        4.0K Sep  2 15:51 node_modules\n-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         415 Sep  8 00:52 server.js\n```\n\nSome of the useful debugging commands include `cat /proc/<TARGET_PID>/cmdline`, `ls -l /proc/<TARGET_PID>/cwd`, `cat /proc/1/environ`, `cat /proc/<TARGET_PID>/limits`, `cat /proc/<TARGET_PID>/status` and `ls -l /proc/<TARGET_PID>/fd`.\n\n\n## MINIFYING COMMAND LINE TOOLS\n\nUnless the default CMD instruction in your Dockerfile is sufficient you'll have to specify command line parameters when you execute the `build` command in Slim. This can be done with the `--cmd` option.\n\nOther useful command line parameters:\n\n- `--show-clogs` - use it if you want to see the output of your container.\n- `--mount` - use it to mount a volume when Slim inspects your image.\n- `--entrypoint` - use it if you want to override the ENTRYPOINT instruction when Slim inspects your image.\n\nNote that the `--entrypoint` and `--cmd` options don't override the `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` instructions in the final minified image.\n\nHere's a sample `build` command:\n\n`slim build --show-clogs=true --cmd docker-compose.yml --mount $(pwd)/data/:/data/ dslim/container-transform`\n\nIt's used to minify the `container-transform` tool. You can get the minified image from [`Docker Hub`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dslim/container-transform.slim/).\n\n## QUICK SECCOMP EXAMPLE\n\nIf you want to auto-generate a Seccomp profile AND minify your image use the `build` command. If you only want to auto-generate a Seccomp profile (along with other interesting image metadata) use the `profile` command.\n\nStep one: run Slim\n\n`slim build your-name/your-app`\n\nStep two: use the generated Seccomp profile\n\n`docker run --security-opt seccomp:<slim directory>/.images/<YOUR_APP_IMAGE_ID>/artifacts/your-name-your-app-seccomp.json <your other run params> your-name/your-app`\n\nFeel free to copy the generated profile :-)\n\nYou can use the generated Seccomp profile with your original image or with the minified image.\n\n## USING AUTO-GENERATED SECCOMP PROFILES\n\nYou can use the generated profile with your original image or with the minified image Slim created:\n\n`docker run -it --rm --security-opt seccomp:path_to/my-sample-node-app-seccomp.json -p 8000:8000 my/sample-node-app.slim`\n\n## ORIGINAL DEMO VIDEO\n\n[![DockerSlim demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/uKdHnfEbc-E/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKdHnfEbc-E)\n\n[Demo video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/uKdHnfEbc-E)\n\n## DEMO STEPS\n\nThe demo runs on Mac OS X, but you can build a linux version. Note that these steps are different from the steps in the demo video.\n\n1. Get the Slim app binaries:\n\n* [Mac](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_mac.zip),\n* [Mac M1](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_mac_m1.zip), \n* [Linux](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_linux.tar.gz), \n* [Linux ARM](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_linux_arm.tar.gz),\n* [Linux ARM64](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/releases/download/1.40.11/dist_linux_arm64.tar.gz) \n\nUnzip them and optionally add their directory to your `PATH` environment variable if you want to use the app from other locations.\n\nThe extracted directory contains two binaries (and now it also contains a symlink for the old name):\n\n- `slim` <- the main Slim application binary\n- `slim-sensor` <- the sensor application used to collect information from running containers\n- `docker-slim` <- the symlink to `slim`, the new main app binary (useful if you are still using the old name in your scripts)\n\n2. Clone the `examples` repo to use the sample apps (note: the examples have been moved to a separate repo). You can skip this step if you have your own app.\n\n`git clone https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples.git`\n\n3. Create a Docker image for the sample node.js app in `examples/node_ubuntu`. You can skip this step if you have your own app.\n\n`cd examples/node_ubuntu`\n\n`docker build -t my/sample-node-app .`\n\n4. Run the Slim app:\n\n`./slim build my/sample-node-app` <- run it from the location where you extracted the Slim app binaries (or update your `PATH` env var to include the directory where the Slim app binaries are located)\n\nSlim creates a special container based on the target image you provided. It also creates a resource directory where it stores the information it discovers about your image: `<slim directory>/.images/<TARGET_IMAGE_ID>`.\n\nBy default, the Slim app will run its http probe against the temporary container. If you are minifying a command line tool that doesn't expose any web service interface you'll need to explicitly disable http probing (by setting `--http-probe=false`).\n\n5. Use curl (or other tools) to call the sample app (optional)\n\n`curl http://<YOUR_DOCKER_HOST_IP>:<PORT>`\n\nThis is an optional step to make sure the target app container is doing something. Depending on the application it's an optional step. For some applications it's required if it loads new application resources dynamically based on the requests it's processing (e.g., Ruby or Python).\n\nYou'll see the mapped ports printed to the console when the Slim app starts the target container. You can also get the port number either from the `docker ps` or `docker port <CONTAINER_ID>` commands. The current version of DockerSlim doesn't allow you to map exposed network ports (it works like `docker run \u2026 -P`).\n\n6. Press <enter> and wait until the Slim app says it's done\n\nBy default or when http probing is enabled explicitly the Slim app will continue its execution once the http probe is done running. If you explicitly picked a different `continue-after` option follow the expected steps. For example, for the `enter` `continue-after` option you must press the `enter` button on your keyboard.\n\nIf http probing is enabled (when `http-probe` is set) and if `continue-after` is set to `enter` and you press the `enter` key before the built-in HTTP probe is done the probe might produce an EOF error because the Slim app will shut down the target container before all probe commands are done executing. It's ok to ignore it unless you really need the probe to finish.\n\n7. Once Slim is done check that the new minified image is there\n\n`docker images`\n\nYou should see `my/sample-node-app.slim` in the list of images. Right now all generated images have `.slim` at the end of its name.\n\n8. Use the minified image\n\n`docker run -it --rm --name=\"slim_node_app\" -p 8000:8000 my/sample-node-app.slim`\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Is it safe for production use?\n\nYes! Either way, you should test your Docker images.\n\n### How can I contribute if I don't know Go?\n\nYou don't need to read the language spec and lots of books :-) Go through the [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) and optionally read [50 Shades of Go](http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/) and you'll be ready to contribute!\n\n### What's the best application for Slim?\n\nSlim will work for any containerized application; however, Slim automates app interactions for applications with an HTTP API. You can use Slim even if your app doesn't have an HTTP API. You'll need to interact with your application manually to make sure Slim can observe your application behavior.\n\n### Can I use Slim with dockerized command line tools?\n\nYes. The `--cmd`, `--entrypoint`, and `--mount` options will help you minify your image. The `container-transform` tool is a good example.\n\nNotes:\n\nYou can explore the artifacts Slim generates when it's creating a slim image. You'll find those in `<slim directory>/.images/<TARGET_IMAGE_ID>/artifacts`. One of the artifacts is a \"reverse engineered\" Dockerfile for the original image. It'll be called `Dockerfile.reversed`.\n\nIf you don't want to create a minified image and only want to \"reverse engineer\" the Dockerfile you can use the `info` command.\n\n### What if my Docker images uses the USER command?\n\nThe current version of Slim does include support for non-default users (take a look at the non-default user examples (including the ElasticSearch example located in the `3rdparty` directory) in the [`examples`](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples) repo. Please open tickets if something doesn't work for you.\n\nEverything should work as-is, but for the special cases where the current behavior don't work as expected you can adjust what Slim does using various `build` command parameters: `--run-target-as-user`, `--keep-perms`, `--path-perms`, `--path-perms-file` (along with the `--include-*` parameters).\n\nThe `--run-target-as-user` parameter is enabled by default and it controls if the application in the temporary container is started using the identity from the USER instruction in the container's Dockerfile.\n\nThe `--keep-perms` parameter is also enabled by default. It tells Slim to retain the permissions and the ownership information for the files and directories copied to the optimized container image.\n\nThe `--path-perms` and `--path-perms-file` parameters are similar to the `--include-path` and `--include-path-file` parameters. They are used to overwrite the permission and the user/group information for the target files and directories. Note that the target files/directories are expected to be in the optimized container image. If you don't know if the target files/directories will be in the optimized container you'll need to use one of the `--include-*` parameters (e.g., `--include-path-file`) to explicitly require those artifacts to be included. You can specify the permissions and the ownership information in the `--include-*` parameters too (so you don't need to have the `--path-*` parameters just to set the permissions).\n\nThe `--path-*` and `--include-*` params use the same format to communicate the permission/owernship info: `TARGET_PATH_OR_NAME:PERMS_IN_OCTAL_FORMAT#USER_ID#GROUP_ID`.\n\nYou don't have to specify the user and group IDs if you don't want to change them.\n\nHere's an example using these parameters to minify the standard `nginx` image adding extra artifacts and changing their permissions: `slim build --include-path='/opt:770#104#107' --include-path='/bin/uname:710' --path-perms='/tmp:700' nginx`.\n\nThis is what you'll see in the optimized container image:\n\n```\ndrwx------  0 0      0           0 Feb 28 22:15 tmp/\n-rwx--x---  0 0      0       31240 Mar 14  2015 bin/uname\ndrwxrwx---  0 104    107         0 Feb 28 22:13 opt/\n```\n\nThe `uname` binary isn't used by nginx, so the `--include-path` parameter is used to keep it in the optimized image changing its permissions to `710`.\n\nThe `/tmp` directory will be included in the optimized image on its own, so the `--path-perms` parameter is used to change its permissions to `700`.\n\nWhen you set permissions/user/group on a directory the settings are only applied to that directory and not to the artifacts inside. The future versions will allow you to apply the same settings to everything inside the target directory too.\n\nAlso note that for now you have to use numeric user and group IDs. The future versions will allow you to use user and group names too.\n\n### Nginx fails in my minified image\n\nIf you see `nginx: [emerg] mkdir() \"/var/lib/nginx/body\" failed` it means your nginx setup uses a non-standard temporary directory. Nginx will fail if the base directory for its temporary folders doesn't exist (they won't create the missing intermediate directories). Normally it's `/var/lib/nginx`, but if you have a custom config that points to something else you'll need to add an `--include-path` flag as an extra flag when you run the Slim app.\n\n### Slim fails with a 'no permission to read from' error\n\nThis problem shouldn't happen anymore because the exported artifacts are saved in a tar file and the master app doesn't need to access the files directly anymore.\n\nIf you run older versions of Slim you can get around this problem by running Slim from a root shell. That way it will have access to all exported files.\n\nSlim copies the relevant image artifacts trying to preserve their permissions. If the permissions are too restrictive the master app might not have sufficient privilege to access these files when it's building the new minified image.\n\n## BUILD PROCESS\n\n#### Build Options\n\nPick one of the build options that works best for you.\n\n##### Containerized\n\nRun `make build_in_docker` on linux or `make build_m1_in_docker` on Macs (or `./scripts/docker-builder.run.sh` or click on `./scripts/mac/docker-builder.run.command` on Macs) from the project directory (builds Slim in a Docker container; great if you don't want to install Go on your local machine and if you already have Docker).\n\n##### Native\n\nRun `make build` on linux or `make build_m1` on Macs (or `./scripts/src.build.sh` or click on `./scripts/mac/src.build.command` on Macs) to build Slim natively (requires Go installed locally).\n\nNote:\n\nTry using the latest version of Go building the Slim app. The current version of Go used to build the Slim app is 1.21.\n\n##### Gitpod\n\nIf you have a web browser, you can get a fully pre-configured development environment in one click:\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim)\n\n\n##### Additional Tools\n\n- `license-bill-of-materials` - Optional tool to track dependencies and their licenses.\n- `golint` - Optional tool for code analysis. See `https://github.com/golang/lint` for more details.\n\nYou can install these tools using the `tools.get.sh` shell script in the `scripts` directory.\n\nNotes:\n\n- Make sure you have `golint` if you intend to run the `src.inspect.sh` or `mac.src.inspect.command` scripts.\n\n## CONTRIBUTING\n\nIf the project sounds interesting or if you found a bug see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit a PR or open an issue! Non-code contributions including docs are highly appreciated! Open an issue even if you have a question or something is not clear.\n\n### CORE CONCEPTS\n\n1. Inspect container metadata (static analysis)\n2. Inspect container data (static analysis)\n3. Inspect running application (dynamic analysis)\n4. Build an application artifact graph\n5. Use the collected application data to build small images\n6. Use the collected application data to auto-generate various security framework configurations.\n\n### DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OPTIONS\n\n1. Instrument the container image (and replace the entrypoint/cmd) to collect application activity data\n2. Use kernel-level tools that provide visibility into running containers (without instrumenting the containers)\n3. Disable relevant namespaces in the target container to gain container visibility (can be done with runC)\n\n### SECURITY\n\nThe goal is to auto-generate Seccomp, AppArmor, (and potentially SELinux) profiles based on the collected information.\n\n- AppArmor profiles\n- Seccomp profiles\n\n### CHALLENGES\n\nSome of the advanced analysis options require a number of Linux kernel features that are not always included. The kernel you get with Docker Machine / Boot2docker is a great example of that.\n\n## ORIGINS\n\nDockerSlim was a `Docker Global Hack Day` \\#`dockerhackday` project. It barely worked at the time, but it did get a win in Seattle and it took the second place in the `Plumbing` category overall :-)\n\n![DHD3](assets/images/dhd/docker_global_hackday3_red.png)\n\nSince then it's been improved and it works pretty well for its core use cases. It can be better though. That's why the project needs your help! You don't need to know much about the container internals, container runtimes and you don't need to know anything about Go. You can contribute in many different ways. For example, use Slim on your images and open Github issues documenting your experience even if it worked just fine :-)\n\n## LICENSE\n\nApache License v2, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/blob/master/LICENSE) for details.\n\n## CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nThe project follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).\n\n---\n\n**We are a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) sandbox project.**\n\n<img src=\"assets/images/cncf/cncf.svg\" width=300 />\n\n---\n\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/slimtoolkit/slim)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/slimtoolkit/slim)\n\n",
