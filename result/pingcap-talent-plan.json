It aims to create or combine some open source learning materials for people interested in open source, distributed systems, Rust, Golang, and other infrastructure knowledge. As such, it provides a series of courses focused on open source collaboration, rust programming, distributed database and systems.\n\n> Note:\n\n> Each course is developed by different teams, so they may vary in their organization and learning outcomes. Please see the individual course documentation for details.\n\n## Our Courses\n\n### Series 1: Open Source Collaboration\n\nOpen source collaboration includes a series of open-source related learning materials to help  enthusiasts gain basic knowledge of what open source software is, the differences between existing open-source software licenses, how to participate in open source projects, and what a welcoming open source community looks like. \n\nCourses include:\n\n- [TP 101: Introduction to open source software](courses/tp101-intro-to-oss.md)\n- [TP 102: How to use Git and GitHub](courses/tp102-how-to-use-git-github.md)\n- [TP 103: Build a welcoming community](courses/tp103-open-source-community.md)\n\n### Series 2: Rust Programming\n\nThis series is core to TALENT-PLAN. It builds your understanding of Rust as a programming language and provides opportunities for you to practice with it.\n\nCourses include:\n\n- [TP 201: Practical Networked Applications in Rust](courses/rust/README.md). A series of projects that incrementally develop a single Rust project from the ground up into a high-performance, networked, parallel and asynchronous key/value store. Along the way various real-world Rust development subject matter are explored and discussed.\n\n- [TP 202: Distributed Systems in Rust](courses/dss/README.md). Adapted from the [MIT 6.824](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2017/index.html) distributed systems coursework, this course focuses on implementing important distributed algorithms, including the [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus algorithm, and the [Percolator](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/36726.pdf) distributed transaction protocol.\n\n### Series 3: Distributed Database \n\nThis series provides information on TinySQL and TinyKV, which are distributed databases in Go.\n\nCourses include:\n\n- [TP 301: TinySQL, a distributed relational database in Go](https://github.com/pingcap-incubator/tinysql)\n- [TP 302: TinyKV, a distributed key value database in Go](https://github.com/pingcap-incubator/tinykv) \n\n### Series 4: Deep Dive into TiDB Ecosystems \n\nThis series provides information on TiDB and TiKV, which are distributed databases developed by PingCAP.\n\nCourses include:\n\n- TP 401: Deep Dive into TiDB(WIP)\n- TP 402: Deep Dive into TiKV(WIP)\n\n\nSee [Courses](courses/README.md) for more details.\n\n# Contributing to talent plan\n\nContributions of any kind are welcome!
