        "readme": "Hugo\n====\n\nAnnotation-triggered method call logging for your debug builds.\n\nAs a programmer, you often add log statements to print method calls, their arguments, their return\nvalues, and the time it took to execute. This is not a question. Every one of you does this.\nShouldn't it be easier?\n\nSimply add `@DebugLog` to your methods and you will automatically get all of the things listed above\nlogged for free.\n\n```java\n@DebugLog\npublic String getName(String first, String last) {\n  SystemClock.sleep(15); // Don't ever really do this!\n  return first + \" \" + last;\n}\n```\n```\nV/Example: \u21e2 getName(first=\"Jake\", last=\"Wharton\")\nV/Example: \u21e0 getName [16ms] = \"Jake Wharton\"\n```\n\nThe logging will only happen in debug builds and the annotation itself is never present in the\ncompiled class file for any build type. This means you can keep the annotation and check it into\nsource control. It has zero effect on non-debug builds.\n\nAdd it to your project today!\n\n```groovy\nbuildscript {\n  repositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n  }\n\n  dependencies {\n    classpath 'com.jakewharton.hugo:hugo-plugin:1.2.1'\n  }\n}\n\napply plugin: 'com.android.application'\napply plugin: 'com.jakewharton.hugo'\n```\n\nDisable logging temporarily by adding the following:\n\n```groovy\nhugo {\n  enabled false\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to toggle logging at runtime, use `Hugo.setEnabled(true|false)`\n\n\nLocal Development\n-----------------\n\nWorking on this project? Here's some helpful Gradle tasks:\n\n * `install` - Install plugin, runtime, and annotations into local repo.\n * `cleanExample` - Clean the example project build.\n * `assembleExample` - Build the example project. Must run `install` first.\n * `installExample` - Build and install the example project debug APK onto a device.\n\n\nLicense\n--------\n\n    Copyright 2013 Jake Wharton\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n",
