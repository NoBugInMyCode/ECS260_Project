Our goal is to become the **central crowdsourced resource** for complete and up-to-date Android content and tutorials. [Just take me to the notes](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki#getting-started)!\n\n[![CodePath](http://i.imgur.com/XgxWfyF.png)](http://codepath.com)\n\nWe have guides for everyone whether you are **beginner, intermediate or advanced**. Want to learn how to [use the ActionBar](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Defining-The-ActionBar) or the [ins and outs of fragments](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Creating-and-Using-Fragments)? We got that. Want to learn [about testing](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Android-Testing-Options) or how to [build flexible user interfaces for multiple devices](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Flexible-User-Interfaces)? We got you covered. We don't waste time with the \"theoretical approach\" from a book. We cover **exactly the things we use every day** as we are developing apps for contracts.\n\n**Need Help?** Please join the [google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codepath-android-guides) for these guides where you can post related questions.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEver been **frustrated finding information on outdated one-off blog posts and tutorials** that has since become irrelevant? How many times have you been googling only to find your answer on a **2 year old Stack Overflow post**? We believe there's got to be a better way. Why not have a community to work together in creating useful and detailed documentation for every aspect of Android development(or any platform)? \n\nRead about our [mission to change the way engineers learn new technologies](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/The-CodePath-Goal) and we would love for you to [get involved](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/The-CodePath-Goal#how-do-i-help)! In addition, we are a fledgling startup so if you like this guide and what we are trying to do, please consider following us on twitter [@codepath](https://twitter.com/codepath)! \n\n## Live in San Francisco?\n\nLocated in the San Francisco Bay Area and interested in learning with others in a more structured program? Check out our local [Android](http://www.meetup.com/Learning-Android-Development) or [iOS](http://www.meetup.com/Learning-iOS-Development-SF/) meetup events. We have free evening events and at-cost 1-day workshops to make learning social and connect you with others passionate about mobile.\n\nIf you are an experienced engineer (2+ years of professional experience in software development) and serious about learning Android, check out our [free evening 8-week Android bootcamp](http://codepath.com/androidbootcamp). Learn how to build mobile apps while collaborating with other engineers and designers. Work on solving important problems for non-profits with our free 8-week accelerated evening mobile boot camp. [Learn more and apply here](http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_android/about_bootcamp).\n\n## We Need Your Help!\n\nWe need your help making the guides even better. In particular, here are the easiest ways to contribute:\n\n1. **Update Guides.** Review existing guides and update outdated content, add tips or add/update images\n2. **Fill Out Guides.** Find guides that are [simply stubs](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues/2) and fill them out with content.\n3. **Create New Guides.** Review the [missing topics list](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues/2) and create new topic guides.\n\nWe [maintain a master missing topics list](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues/2) that contains the most important missing topics. Also, look for items in the cliff notes with the **Needs Attention** mark which indicates the guide needs some love. If you see a topic you'd like added, please check the [issues](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues) for this repository to let us know.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to our guides, please check out our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines) first.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThese guides were originally created and adapted by [Nathan Esquenazi](https://github.com/nesquena) \nas a part of our [CodePath](http://codepath.com) training and bootcamps. We have also had contributions from many\ncommunity members including:\n\n * [Nidhi Shah](https://github.com/nidhi1608) (CodePath Alumni and Staff)\n * [Roger Hu](https://github.com/rogerhu) (CodePath Alumni and Instructor)\n * [Nick Aiwazian](https://github.com/nickai) (CodePath Alumni and Instructor)\n * [Kevin Leong](https://github.com/kgleong) (CodePath Alumni and Instructor)\n * [Michael Alan Huff](https://github.com/koalahamlet) (CodePath Alumni and Mentor)\n * [Vibhor Bharadwaj](https://github.com/vibhorB) (CodePath Alumni and Mentor)\n * [Ari Lacenski](https://github.com/tensory) (CodePath Alumni)\n * [Chunyan Song](https://github.com/chunyan) (CodePath Alumni)\n * [Vishal Kapoor](https://github.com/kapoor) (CodePath Alumni)\n * [Trevor Elkins](https://github.com/trevor-e)\n * [Adrian Romero](https://github.com/romeroadrian)\n * [Aaron Fleshner](https://github.com/adfleshner)\n * [Steven Dobek](https://github.com/sdobek)\n",
