The Snowflake we're using internally is a\nfull rewrite and heavily relies on existing infrastructure at Twitter to run.\nWe cannot commit to a date but we're doing our best to add necessary features to\nmake Snowflake fit for many environments outside of Twitter.\n\nSource code is still in the repository and is reachable from\n[snowflake-2010](https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/releases/tag/snowflake-2010)\ntag.\n\nWe won't be accepting pull requests or responding to issues for the retired\nrelease.\n",
