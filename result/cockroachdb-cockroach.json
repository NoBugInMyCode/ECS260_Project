It **scales** horizontally;\n**survives** disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with\nminimal latency disruption and no manual intervention; supports\n**strongly-consistent** ACID transactions; and provides a familiar\n**SQL** API for structuring, manipulating, and querying data.\n\nFor more details, see our [FAQ](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/frequently-asked-questions.html) or [architecture document](\nhttps://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/overview.html).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgXiMcbGwzQ'> <img src='docs/media/explainer-video-preview.png' width='70%'> </a>\n</p>\n\n## Docs\n\nFor guidance on installation, development, deployment, and administration, see our [User Documentation](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/).\n\n## Starting with CockroachCloud\n\nWe can run CockroachDB for you, so you don't have to run your own cluster.\n\nSee our online documentation: [Quickstart with CockroachCloud](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/quickstart.html)\n\n## Starting with CockroachDB\n\n1. Install CockroachDB:  [using a pre-built executable](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb.html) or [build it from source](https://cockroachlabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CRDB/pages/181338446/Getting+and+building+CockroachDB+from+source).\n2. [Start a local cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster.html) and connect to it via the [built-in SQL client](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html).\n3. [Learn more about CockroachDB SQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/learn-cockroachdb-sql.html).\n4. Use a PostgreSQL-compatible driver or ORM to [build an app with CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/hello-world-example-apps.html).\n5. [Explore core features](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/demo-data-replication.html), such as data replication, automatic rebalancing, and fault tolerance and recovery.\n\n## Client Drivers\n\nCockroachDB supports the PostgreSQL wire protocol, so you can use any available PostgreSQL client drivers to connect from various languages.\n\n- For recommended drivers that we've tested, see [Install Client Drivers](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-client-drivers.html).\n- For tutorials using these drivers, as well as supported ORMs, see [Example Apps](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/example-apps.html).\n\n## Deployment\n\n- [CockroachCloud](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/quickstart) - Steps to create a [free CockroachCloud cluster](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/signup?referralId=githubquickstart) on your preferred Cloud platform.\n- [Manual](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/manual-deployment.html) - Steps to deploy a CockroachDB cluster manually on multiple machines.\n- [Cloud](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/cloud-deployment.html) - Guides for deploying CockroachDB on various cloud platforms.\n- [Orchestration](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/orchestration.html) - Guides for running CockroachDB with popular open-source orchestration systems.\n\n## Need Help?\n\n- [CockroachDB Community Slack](https://go.crdb.dev/p/slack) - Join our slack to connect with our engineers and other users running CockroachDB.\n- [CockroachDB Forum](https://forum.cockroachlabs.com/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cockroachdb) - Ask questions, find answers, and help other users.\n- [Troubleshooting documentation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/troubleshooting-overview.html) - Learn how to troubleshoot common errors, cluster setup, and SQL query behavior.\n- For filing bugs, suggesting improvements, or requesting new features, help us out by [opening an issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/new).\n\n## Building from source\n\nSee [our wiki](https://wiki.crdb.io/wiki/spaces/CRDB/pages/181338446/Getting+and+building+from+source) for more details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions! If you're looking for issues to work on, try looking at the [good first issue list](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). We do our best to tag issues suitable for new external contributors with that label, so it's a great way to find something you can help with!\n\nSee [our wiki](https://wiki.crdb.io/wiki/spaces/CRDB/pages/73204033/Contributing+to+CockroachDB) for more details.\n\nEngineering discussions take place on our public mailing list, [cockroach-db@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cockroach-db).
