I made this chart as a tip for everyone who asks me, \"*What should I learn next as a Go developer?*\"\n\n[\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u7248](./i18n/zh-CN/ReadMe-zh-CN.md)\n[\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\u7248](./i18n/zh-TW/ReadMe-zh-TW.md)\n[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u7248](./i18n/ja-JP/ReadMe-ja-JP.md)\n[Vers\u00e3o em Portugu\u00eas do Brasil](./i18n/pt-BR/ReadMe-pt-BR.md)\n[\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4](./i18n/ko-KR/ReadMe-ko-KR.md)\n[\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439](./i18n/ru-RU/ReadMe-ru-RU.md)\n[\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430](./i18n/uk-UA/ReadMe-uk-UA.md)\n[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](i18n/ar-IQ/ReadMe-ar-IQ.md)\n## Disclaimer\n\n> The purpose of this roadmap is to give you an idea about the landscape. The road map will guide you if you are confused about what to learn next, rather than encouraging you to pick what is hype and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would be better suited for some cases than the other and remember hype and trendy does not always mean best suited for the job.\n\n## Give a Star! :star:\n\nIf you like or are using this project to learn or start your solution, please give it a star.

Project file can be found at `golang-developer-roadmap.xml` file. To modify it, open draw.io, click **Open Existing Diagram** and choose `xml` file with project. It will open the roadmap for you. Update it, upload and update the images in readme and create a PR (export as png with 400% zoom and minify that with [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/compress)).\n\n- Open a pull request with improvements\n- Discuss ideas in issues\n- Spread the word\n\n## License\n\n[![License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--NC--SA%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n",
