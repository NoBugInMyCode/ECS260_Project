We have _temporarily_ moved development to a private repo so we can iterate faster. We'll push our work back to this public repo soon. Terms and license will remain OSS, as before. (Also, [we're hiring \u2013 join the core team!](https://www.theatrejs.com/join)).\n\nTheatre.js is an animation library for high-fidelity motion graphics. It is\ndesigned to help you express detailed animation, enabling you to create\nintricate movement, and convey nuance.\n\nTheatre.js can be used both programmatically _and_ visually.\n\n---\n\nYou can use Theatre.js to:\n\n- Animate 3D objects made with THREE.js or other 3D libraries\n\n  ![s](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AriaMinaei/theatre-docs/main/docs/.vuepress/public/preview-3d-short.gif)\n\n  <sub>Art by\n  [drei.lu](https://sketchfab.com/models/91964c1ce1a34c3985b6257441efa500)</sub>\n\n- Animate HTML/SVG via React or other libraries\n\n  ![s](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AriaMinaei/theatre-docs/main/docs/.vuepress/public/preview-dom.gif)\n\n- Design micro-interactions\n\n  ![s](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AriaMinaei/theatre-docs/main/docs/.vuepress/public/preview-micro-interaction.gif)\n\n- Choreograph generative interactive art\n\n  ![s](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AriaMinaei/theatre-docs/main/docs/.vuepress/public/preview-generative.gif)\n\n- Or animate any other JS variable\n\n  ![s](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AriaMinaei/theatre-docs/main/docs/.vuepress/public/preview-console.gif)\n\n## Documentation and Tutorials\n\nThe docs are at [theatrejs.com/docs](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs):\n\n- [Video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsp9XOCs8v2twyq5kMLzS2Q)\n  - [Crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icR9EIS1q34)\n  - [Animating with music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoS4gMxwq_4)\n  - [Yuri Artiukh](https://twitter.com/akella)'s\n    [stream](https://youtu.be/qmRqgFbNprM?t=3462) with a section on using\n    Theatre.js with THREE.js\n  - \\<Add your own tutorials here\\>\n\n## Community and support\n\nJoin our friendly community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bm9f8F9Y9N), follow\nthe updates on [twitter](https://twitter.com/theatre_js) or write us an\n[email](mailto:hello@theatrejs.com).\n\n## Development and contributing\n\nIf you want to change the source of Theatre, have a look at the guide\n[here](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Proposing fixes and changes\n\nYou can always get help with bugfixes or discuss changes with our community on\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/bm9f8F9Y9N), or directly open an issue on Github.\n\n### Helping with outstanding issues\n\nFeel free to chime in on any\n[issue](https://github.com/AriaMinaei/theatre/issues).

Your project's final bundle\n  only includes `@theatre/core`, so only the Apache License applies.\n",
