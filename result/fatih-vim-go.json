Run a single test with `:GoTestFunc`).\n* Quickly execute your current file(s) with `:GoRun`.\n* Improved syntax highlighting and folding.\n* Debug programs with integrated [`delve`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) support with `:GoDebugStart`.\n* Completion and many other features support via `gopls`.\n* formatting on save keeps the cursor position and undo history.\n* Go to symbol/declaration with `:GoDef`.\n* Look up documentation with `:GoDoc` or `:GoDocBrowser`.\n* Easily import packages via `:GoImport`, remove them via `:GoDrop`.\n* Precise type-safe renaming of identifiers with `:GoRename`.\n* See which code is covered by tests with `:GoCoverage`.\n* Add or remove tags on struct fields with `:GoAddTags` and `:GoRemoveTags`.\n* Lint your code with `:GoLint` or `:GoMetaLinter`, run your code through `:GoVet` to catch static errors, or make sure errors are checked with `:GoErrCheck`.\n* Advanced source analysis utilizing `gopls`, such as `:GoImplements`, `:GoCallees`, and `:GoReferrers`.\n* ... and many more! Please see [doc/vim-go.txt](doc/vim-go.txt) for more information.\n* Integration with [`gopls`](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/README.md).\n* The `gopls` instance can be shared with other Vim plugins.\n* Vim-go's use of `gopls` can be disabled and alternative tools can be used when desired.\n* Integration with [`Tagbar`](https://github.com/preservim/tagbar) via [`gotags`](https://github.com/jstemmer/gotags).\n* Integration with [`Ultisnips`](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) and other snippet engines.\n\n## Install\n\nvim-go requires at least Vim 8.1.2269 or Neovim 0.4.0.\n\nThe [**latest stable release**](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/releases/latest) is the\nrecommended version to use. If you choose to use the master branch instead,\nplease do so with caution; it is a _development_ branch.\n\n\nvim-go follows the standard runtime path structure. Below are some helper lines\nfor popular package managers:\n\n* [Vim 8 packages](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/repeat.txt.html#packages)\n  * `git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go`\n* [Neovim packages](https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html#packages)\n  * `git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/plugins/start/vim-go`\n* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)\n  * `git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-go`\n* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)\n  * `Plug 'fatih/vim-go', { 'do': ':GoUpdateBinaries' }`\n* [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)\n  * `Plugin 'fatih/vim-go'`\n\nYou will also need to install all the necessary binaries. vim-go makes it easy\nto install all of them by providing a command, `:GoInstallBinaries`, which will\n`go install` all the required binaries.\n\nCheck out the Install section in [the documentation](doc/vim-go.txt) for more\ndetailed instructions (`:help go-install`).\n\n## Usage\n\nThe full documentation can be found at [doc/vim-go.txt](doc/vim-go.txt). You can\ndisplay it from within Vim with `:help vim-go`.\n\nDepending on your installation method, you may have to generate the plugin's\n[`help tags`](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/helphelp.txt.html#%3Ahelptags)\nmanually (e.g. `:helptags ALL`).\n\nWe also have a [tutorial](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/wiki/Tutorial) in the [official vim-go wiki](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/wiki).\n\n## FAQ and troubleshooting\n\nThe FAQ and troubleshooting tips are in the documentation and can be quickly\naccessed using `:help go-troubleshooting`. If you believe you've found a bug or\nshortcoming in vim-go that is neither addressed by help nor in [existing\nissues](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/issues), please open an issue with\nclear reproduction steps. `:GoReportGitHubIssue` can be used pre-populate a lot\nof the information needed when creating a new issue.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAll PRs are welcome. If you are planning to contribute a large patch or to\nintegrate a new tool, please create an issue first to get any upfront questions\nor design decisions out of the way first.\n\nYou can run the tests locally by running `make`. It will lint the VimL for you,\nlint the documentation, and run the tests against the minimum required version\nof Vim, other versions of Vim that may be critical to support, and Neovim.\n\n## License\n\nThe BSD 3-Clause License - see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for more details\n\n",
