HHVM uses a just-in-time (JIT) compilation approach to achieve superior performance while maintaining amazing development flexibility.\n\nHHVM should be used together with a webserver like the built in, easy to deploy [Proxygen](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/basic-usage/proxygen), or a [FastCGI](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/advanced-usage/fastCGI)-based webserver on top of nginx or Apache.\n\n## Installing\n\nIf you're new, try our [getting started guide](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/getting-started/getting-started).\n\nYou can install a [prebuilt package](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/installation/introduction#prebuilt-packages) or [compile from source](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/installation/building-from-source).\n\n## Running\n\nYou can run standalone programs just by passing them to hhvm: `hhvm example.hack`.\n\nIf you want to host a website:\n* Install your favorite webserver. [Proxygen](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/basic-usage/proxygen) is built into HHVM, fast and easy to deploy.\n* Install our [package](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/installation/introduction#prebuilt-packages)\n* Start your webserver\n* Run `sudo /etc/init.d/hhvm start`\n* Visit your site at `http://.../main.hack`\n\nOur [getting started guide](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/getting-started/getting-started) provides a slightly more detailed introduction as well as links to more information.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe'd love to have your help in making HHVM better. If you're interested, please read our [guide to contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\nHHVM is licensed under the PHP and Zend licenses except as otherwise noted.\n\nThe [Hack typechecker](hphp/hack) is licensed under the MIT [License](hphp/hack/LICENSE) except as otherwise noted.\n\nThe [Hack Standard Library](hphp/hsl) is licensed under the MIT [License](hphp/hsl/LICENSE) except as otherwise noted.\n\n## Reporting Crashes\n\nSee [Reporting Crashes](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Reporting-Crashes) for helpful tips on how to report crashes in an actionable manner.\n\n## Security\n\nFor information on reporting security vulnerabilities in HHVM, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).\n\n## FAQ\n\nOur [user FAQ](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/FAQ/faq) has answers to many common questions about HHVM, from [general questions](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/FAQ/faq#general) to questions geared towards those that want to [use](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/FAQ/faq#users).\n\nThere is also a FAQ for [contributors](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/FAQ#contributors) to HHVM.\n",
