If you post images to Google+, Facebook, or Twitter, be sure to tag them with [#deepdream](https://twitter.com/hashtag/deepdream) so other researchers can check them out too.\n\n* [Alexander Mordvintsev](mailto:moralex@google.com)\n* [Michael Tyka](https://www.twitter.com/mtyka)\n* [Christopher Olah](mailto:colah@google.com)\n",
