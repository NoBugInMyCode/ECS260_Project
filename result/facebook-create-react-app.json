We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.\n\nTo create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:\n\n### npx\n\n```sh\nnpx create-react-app my-app\n```\n\n_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_\n\n### npm\n\n```sh\nnpm init react-app my-app\n```\n\n_`npm init <initializer>` is available in npm 6+_\n\n### Yarn\n\n```sh\nyarn create react-app my-app\n```\n\n_[`yarn create <starter-kit-package>`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) is available in Yarn 0.25+_\n\nIt will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>\nInside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:\n\n```\nmy-app\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 node_modules\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 public\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 favicon.ico\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 manifest.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 App.css\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 App.js\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 App.test.js\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.css\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.js\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 logo.svg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 serviceWorker.js\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 setupTests.js\n```\n\nNo configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.<br>\nOnce the installation is done, you can open your project folder:\n\n```sh\ncd my-app\n```\n\nInside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:\n\n### `npm start` or `yarn start`\n\nRuns the app in development mode.<br>\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>\nYou will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/marionebl/create-react-app@9f6282671c54f0874afd37a72f6689727b562498/screencast-error.svg' width='600' alt='Build errors'>\n</p>\n\n### `npm test` or `yarn test`\n\nRuns the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>\nBy default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.\n\n[Read more about testing.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)\n\n### `npm run build` or `yarn build`\n\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>\n\nYour app is ready to be deployed.\n\n## User Guide\n\nYou can find detailed instructions on using Create React App and many tips in [its documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/).\n\n## How to Update to New Versions?\n\nPlease refer to the [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/updating-to-new-releases) for this and other information.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n- **One Dependency:** There is only one build dependency. It uses webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.\n\n- **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.\n\n- **No Lock-In:** You can \u201ceject\u201d to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.\n\n## What\u2019s Included?\n\nYour environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:\n\n- React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.\n- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.\n- Autoprefixed CSS, so you don\u2019t need `-webkit-` or other prefixes.\n- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.\n- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.\n- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.\n- An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria. (_Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher_)\n- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.\n\nCheck out [this guide](https://github.com/nitishdayal/cra_closer_look) for an overview of how these tools fit together.\n\nThe tradeoff is that **these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way**. If your project needs more customization, you can [\"eject\"](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject) and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.\n\n## Popular Alternatives\n\nCreate React App is a great fit for:\n\n- **Learning React** in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment.\n- **Starting new single-page React applications.**\n- **Creating examples** with React for your libraries and components.\n\nHere are a few common cases where you might want to try something else:\n\n- If you want to **try React** without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider [using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#try-react).\n\n- If you need to **integrate React code with a server-side template framework** like Rails, Django or Symfony, or if you\u2019re **not building a single-page app**, consider using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb), or [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) which are more flexible. For Rails specifically, you can use [Rails Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker). For Symfony, try [Symfony's webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/reactjs.html).\n\n- If you need to **publish a React component**, [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) can [also do this](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries), as well as [Neutrino's react-components preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react-components/).\n\n- If you want to do **server rendering** with React and Node.js, check out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle). Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and only produces static HTML/JS/CSS bundles.\n\n- If your website is **mostly static** (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Unlike Create React App, Gatsby pre-renders the website into HTML at build time. Next.js supports both server rendering and pre-rendering.\n\n- Finally, if you need **more customization**, check out [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) and its [React preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react/).\n\nAll of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.\n\nIf you prefer configuring the build yourself, [follow this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html).\n\n## React Native\n\nLooking for something similar, but for React Native?<br>\nCheck out [Expo CLI](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe'd love to have your helping hand on `create-react-app`!
