Perfect for:\n\n- Developer workstations\n- IoT\n- Edge\n- CI/CD\n\n > Canonical might have assembled the easiest way to provision a single node Kubernetes cluster - [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1120834594138406912)\n\n## Why MicroK8s?\n\n- **Small**. Developers want the smallest K8s for laptop and workstation\n  development.  MicroK8s provides a standalone K8s compatible with Azure\n  AKS, Amazon EKS, Google GKE when you run it on Ubuntu.\n\n- **Simple**. Minimize administration and operations with a single-package\n  install that has no moving parts for simplicity and certainty. All\n  dependencies and batteries included.\n\n- **Secure**. Updates are available for all security issues and can be\n  applied immediately or scheduled to suit your maintenance cycle.\n\n- **Current**. MicroK8s tracks upstream and releases beta, RC and final bits\n  the same day as upstream K8s. You can track latest K8s or stick to any\n  release version from 1.10 onwards.\n\n- **Comprehensive**. MicroK8s includes a curated collection of manifests for\n  common K8s capabilities and services:\n\n  - Service Mesh: Istio, Linkerd\n  - Serverless: Knative\n  - Monitoring: Fluentd, Prometheus, Grafana, Metrics\n  - Ingress, DNS, Dashboard, Clustering\n  - Automatic updates to the latest Kubernetes version\n  - GPGPU bindings for AI/ML\n\nDrop us a line at [MicroK8s in the Wild](docs/community.md) if you are\ndoing something fun with MicroK8s!\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstall MicroK8s with:\n\n```\nsnap install microk8s --classic\n```\n\nMicroK8s includes a `microk8s kubectl` command:\n\n```\nsudo microk8s kubectl get nodes\nsudo microk8s kubectl get services\n```\n\nTo use MicroK8s with your existing kubectl:\n\n```\nsudo microk8s kubectl config view --raw > $HOME/.kube/config\n```\n\n#### User access without sudo\nThe *microk8s* user group is created during the snap installation. Users in that group\nare granted access to `microk8s` commands. To add a user to that group:\n```\nsudo usermod -a -G microk8s <username>\n```\n\n\n#### Kubernetes add-ons\n\nMicroK8s installs a barebones upstream Kubernetes. Additional services like dns and the Kubernetes dashboard can be enabled using the `microk8s enable` command.\n\n```\nsudo microk8s enable dns\nsudo microk8s enable dashboard\n```\n\nUse `microk8s status` to see a list of enabled and available addons. You can find the addon manifests and/or scripts under `${SNAP}/actions/`, with `${SNAP}` pointing by default to `/snap/microk8s/current`.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [official docs](https://microk8s.io/docs/) are maintained in the\nKubernetes upstream Discourse.\n\nTake a look at the [build instructions](docs/build.md) if you want to\ncontribute to MicroK8s.\n\n<a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/microk8s\" title=\"Get it from the Snap Store\">\n            <img src=\"https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg\" alt=\"Get it from the Snap Store\" width=\"200\" />\n          </a>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/canonical/microk8s/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=canonical/microk8s\" />\n</a>\n",
