No pre-existing knowledge of docker is required, just execute two simple commands and you have a vulnerable environment.\n\n[\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c(Chinese version)](README.zh-cn.md)\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall Docker on Ubuntu 22.04:\n\n```bash\n# Install the latest version docker\ncurl -s https://get.docker.com/ | sh\n\n# Run docker service\nsystemctl start docker\n```\n\nNote that as of April 2022, `docker compose` is merged into Docker as a subcommand as [Docker Compose V2](https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-compose-v2-general-availability/), the Python version of docker-compose will be deprecated after June 2023. So Vulhub will no longer require the installation of additional `docker-compose`, and all documentation will be modified to use the `docker compose` instead.\n\nThe installation steps of Docker and Docker Compose for other operating systems might be slightly different, please refer to the [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for details.\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n# Download project\nwget https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/archive/master.zip -O vulhub-master.zip\nunzip vulhub-master.zip\ncd vulhub-master\n\n# Enter the directory of vulnerability/environment\ncd flask/ssti\n\n# Compile environment\ndocker compose build\n\n# Run environment\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nThere is a **README** document in each environment directory, please read this file for vulnerability/environment testing and usage.\n\nAfter the test, delete the environment with the following command.\n\n```\ndocker compose down -v\n```\n\nIt is recommended to use a VPS of at least 1GB memory to build a vulnerability environment. The `your-ip` mentioned in the documentation refers to the IP address of your VPS. If you are using a virtual machine, it refers to your virtual machine IP, not the IP inside the docker container.\n\n**All environments in this project are for testing purposes only and should not be used as a production environment!**\n\n## Notice\n\n1. To prevent permission errors, please ensure that the docker container has permission to access all files in the current directory.\n2. Vulhub does not support running on machines with non-x86 architecture such as ARM for now.\n\n## Contribution\n\nThis project relies on docker. So any error during compilation and running are thrown by docker and related programs. Please find the cause of the error by yourself first. If it is determined that the dockerfile is written incorrectly (or the code is wrong in vulhub), then submit the issue. More details please \ud83d\udc49[Common reasons for compilation failure](https://github.com/phith0n/vulhub/wiki/%E7%BC%96%E8%AF%91%E5%A4%B1%E8%B4%A5%E7%9A%84%E5%8E%9F%E5%9B%A0), hope it can help you.\n\nFor more question, please contact:\n\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/bQCpZEK)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vulhub)\n\nThanks for the following contributors:\n\n[![](https://opencollective.com/vulhub/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false)](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/graphs/contributors)\n\nMore contributors\uff1a[Contributors List](contributors.md)\n\n## Partner\n\nOur Partners and users:\n\n<p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.wangan.com/vulhub\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://vulhub.org/img/sponsor/wangan.png\" width=\"200\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.cvebase.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://vulhub.org/img/sponsor/cvebase.png\" width=\"200\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.huoxian.cn\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://vulhub.org/img/sponsor/huoxian.png\" width=\"200\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.chaitin.cn\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://vulhub.org/img/sponsor/chaitin.png\" width=\"200\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://xz.aliyun.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://vulhub.org/img/sponsor/aliyun.svg\" width=\"200\"></a>\n</p>\n\nSponsor vulhub on patreon \ud83d\ude4f\n\n<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=12677520\"><img src=\"https://vulhub.org/img/sponsor/patreon.png\" width=\"150\"></a>\n\nSponsor vulhub on opencollective \ud83d\ude4f\n\n<p>\n  <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/vulhub#backer\"><img src=\"https://opencollective.com/vulhub/backers.svg?width=138\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/vulhub#sponsor\"><img src=\"https://opencollective.com/vulhub/sponsors.svg?width=138\"></a>\n</p>\n\nMore [Donate](http://vulhub.org/#/docs/donate/).\n\n## License\n\nVulhub is licensed under the MIT License.
