Or try the examples in the \"demos\" subdirectory.\n\nFor a presentation highlighting this package, compile and run the program found in the \"demos/presentation\" subdirectory.\n\n## Projects using `tview`\n\n- [K9s - Kubernetes CLI](https://github.com/derailed/k9s)\n- [IRCCloud Terminal Client](https://github.com/termoose/irccloud)\n- [Window manager for `tview`](https://github.com/epiclabs-io/winman)\n- [CLI bookmark manager](https://github.com/Endi1/drawer)\n- [A caving database interface written in Go](https://github.com/IdlePhysicist/cave-logger)\n- [Interactive file browse and exec any command.](https://github.com/bannzai/itree)\n- [A complete TUI for LDAP](https://github.com/Macmod/godap)\n- [A simple CRM](https://github.com/broadcastle/crm)\n- [Terminal UI for todist](https://github.com/cyberdummy/todoista)\n- [Graphical kubectl wrapper](https://github.com/dcaiafa/kpick)\n- [Decred Decentralized Exchange ](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)\n- [A CLI file browser for Raspberry PI](https://github.com/destinmoulton/pixi)\n- [A tool to manage projects.](https://github.com/divramod/dp)\n- [A simple app for BMI monitoring](https://github.com/erleene/go-bmi)\n- [Stream TIDAL from command line](https://github.com/godsic/vibe)\n- [Secure solution for fully decentralized password management](https://github.com/guillaumemichel/passtor/)\n- [A growing collection of convenient little tools to work with systemd services](https://github.com/muesli/service-tools/)\n- [A terminal based browser for Redis written in Go](https://github.com/nitishm/redis-terminal)\n- [First project for the Computer Networks course.](https://github.com/pablogadhi/XMPPClient)\n- [Test your typing speed in the terminal!](https://github.com/shilangyu/typer-go)\n- [TUI Client for Docker](https://github.com/skanehira/docui)\n- [SSH client using certificates signed by HashiCorp Vault](https://github.com/stephane-martin/vssh)\n- [VMware vCenter Text UI](https://github.com/thebsdbox/vctui)\n- [Bookmarks on terminal](https://github.com/tryffel/bookmarker)\n- [A UDP testing utility](https://github.com/vaelen/udp-tester)\n- [A simple Kanban board for your terminal](https://github.com/witchard/toukan)\n- [The personal information dashboard for your terminal. ](https://github.com/wtfutil/wtf)\n- [MySQL database to Golang struct](https://github.com/xxjwxc/gormt)\n- [Discord, TUI and SIXEL.](https://gitlab.com/diamondburned/6cord)\n- [A CLI Audio Player](https://www.github.com/dhulihan/grump)\n- [GLab, a GitLab CLI tool](https://gitlab.com/profclems/glab)\n- [Browse your AWS ECS Clusters in the Terminal](https://github.com/swartzrock/ecsview)\n- [The CLI Task Manager for Geeks](https://github.com/ajaxray/geek-life)\n- [Fast disk usage analyzer written in Go](https://github.com/dundee/gdu)\n- [Multiplayer Chess On Terminal](https://github.com/qnkhuat/gochess)\n- [Scriptable TUI music player](https://github.com/issadarkthing/gomu)\n- [MangaDesk : TUI Client for downloading manga to your computer](https://github.com/darylhjd/mangadesk)\n- [Go How Much?

Also check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/rivo/tview/wiki).\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis package is based on [github.com/gdamore/tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) (and its dependencies) as well as on [github.com/rivo/uniseg](https://github.com/rivo/uniseg).\n\n## Sponsor this Project\n\n[Become a Sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/rivo?metadata_source=tview_readme) to further this project!\n\n## Versioning and Backwards-Compatibility\n\nI try really hard to keep this project backwards compatible. Your software should not break when you upgrade `tview`. But this also means that some of its shortcomings that were present in the initial versions will remain. In addition, at least for the time being, you won't find any version tags in this repo. The newest version should be the one to upgrade to. It has all the bugfixes and latest features. Having said that, backwards compatibility may still break when:\n\n- a new version of an imported package (most likely [`tcell`](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell)) changes in such a way that forces me to make changes in `tview` as well,\n- I fix something that I consider a bug, rather than a feature, something that does not work as originally intended,\n- I make changes to \"internal\" interfaces such as [`Primitive`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rivo/tview#Primitive). You shouldn't need these interfaces unless you're writing your own primitives for `tview`. (Yes, I realize these are public interfaces. This has advantages as well as disadvantages. For the time being, it is what it is.)\n\n## Your Feedback\n\nAdd your issue here on GitHub.
