[Here is what you need to know.](https://docs.pysimplegui.com/en/latest/readme/sunset/)\n\n**PySimpleGUI creates desktop applications easily**, enhancing the tkinter, Qt, WxPython, and Remi frameworks with a much simpler programming interface:\n\n1. PySimpleGUI user interfaces are defined using core Python data types (lists and dictionaries) that are easily understood by beginners.\n2. PySimpleGUI event handling changes from a complex callback-based model to a simple message passing one.\n3. PySimpleGUI uses simple Python code and has no requirement for object oriented architecture.\n\nPySimpleGUI is more than a GUI library: PySimpleGUI simplifies much of your Python development process. Sure, it makes developing user interfaces much easier, but PySimpleGUI also tames advanced Python functionality (such as threading) and makes it easy for all users to take their Python applications to the next level. PySimpleGUI is a robust toolkit.\n\n## Introducing PySimpleGUI 5\n\nFor the last 5 years, PySimpleGUI offered free software with the hope of sustaining the\ncompany by donations. We appreciate the support we received, but the amount has been too\nsmall to support the PySimpleGUI project. For this reason, PySimpleGUI is switching to a\ncommercial model, where commercial users are expected to pay a nominal license fee.\n\n\nPySimpleGUI is now part of PySimpleSoft, Inc., whose mission is to make the best Python\napplication development environment much, much better. Since launching in 2018, PySimpleGUI\nhas helped hobbyists and professionals alike create Python GUIs in a fraction of the time.\nPySimpleGUI 5 takes PySimpleGUI to the next level, providing hundreds of improvements,\nincluding new features, enhanced security, and priority support.\n\n\nPySimpleGUI 5 is licensed software. As the [License Agreement](LICENSE.txt) explains, after a trial\nperiod, all PySimpleGUI 5 users must register at PySimpleGUI.com to obtain a Developer Key.\nFor most users (Hobbyist Users), the license is at NO COST. If you are a Commercial User, you must buy a license.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://pysimplegui.net/images/pricing_summary.png\">\n</p>\n\n[Register Now](https://pricing.PySimpleGUI.com) and help support the PySimpleGUI community.\n\n## Examples\n\nPySimpleGUI users have created thousands of amazing desktop applications. Here are a few screen shots. For more examples, see the [PySimpleGUI gallery](https://gallery.PySimpleGUI.com/).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img height=\"150\" src=\"https://pysimplegui.net/images/for_readme/gallery1.jpg\" />\n    <img height=\"150\" src=\"https://pysimplegui.net/images/for_readme/gallery2.jpg\" />\n    <img height=\"150\" src=\"https://pysimplegui.net/images/for_readme/gallery3.jpg\" />\n</p>\n\n## Get Started at No Cost\n\nWhether you are a Hobbyist User or Commercial User, you can start using PySimpleGUI at no cost.\nTo get started with a 30-day trial period, first install Python and then\n\n    python -m pip install pysimplegui\n\nand run some code, like\n\n    import PySimpleGUI as sg\n    layout = [ [sg.Text('Hello, world!')] ]\n    window = sg.Window('Hello Example', layout)\n    while True:\n        event, values = window.read()\n        if event == sg.WIN_CLOSED:\n            break\n    window.close()\n\n(You might need to use `python3` instead of `python`.)\n\nYou can try PySimpleGUI for 30 days, after which you will need to register. Hobbyist users register at no cost, and Commercial Users must buy a license.
