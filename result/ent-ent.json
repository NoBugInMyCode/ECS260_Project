It was created by [a8m](https://github.com/a8m) and [alexsn](https://github.com/alexsn) from the [Facebook Connectivity][fbc] team. These days, it is developed and maintained by the [Atlas](https://github.com/ariga/atlas) team, and the roadmap for its v1 release is described [here](https://github.com/ent/ent/issues/46).\n\n## Join the ent Community\nBuilding `ent` would not have been possible without the collective work of our entire community. We maintain a [contributors page](doc/md/contributors.md)\nwhich lists the contributors to this `ent`. \n\nIn order to contribute to `ent`, see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for how to go get started.\nIf your company or your product is using `ent`, please let us know by adding yourself to the [ent users page](https://github.com/ent/ent/wiki/ent-users).\n\nFor updates, follow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/entgo_io\n\n## License\nent is licensed under Apache 2.0 as found in the [LICENSE file](LICENSE).\n\n\n[entgo install]: https://entgo.io/docs/code-gen/#version-compatibility-between-entc-and-ent\n[Go modules]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#quick-start\n[fbc]: https://connectivity.fb.com\n",
