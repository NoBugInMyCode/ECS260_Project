Upgrade the related tools if you're facing issues.\n\nFor 5.18+, SDWebImage can be compiled for visionOS platform. However, it's still in beta and may contains issues unlike the stable iOS UIKit support. Welcome to have a try and [report issue](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/issues).\n\nTo build on visionOS, currently we only support the standard Xcode integration.\n\nSee `Installation with Swift Package Manager` and `Manual Installation Guide` below.\n\n## Supported Image Formats\n\n- Image formats supported by Apple system (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, ...), including [GIF](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#gif-coder)/[APNG](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#apng-coder) animated image\n- HEIC format from iOS 11/macOS 10.13, including animated HEIC from iOS 13/macOS 10.15 via [SDWebImageHEICCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#heic-coder). For lower firmware, use coder plugin [SDWebImageHEIFCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageHEIFCoder)\n- WebP format from iOS 14/macOS 11.0 via [SDWebImageAWebPCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#awebp-coder). For lower firmware, use coder plugin [SDWebImageWebPCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageWebPCoder)\n- JPEG-XL format from iOS 17/macOS 14.0 built-in. For lower firmware, use coder plugin [SDWebImageJPEGXLCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageJPEGXLCoder)\n- Support extendable coder plugins for new image formats like BPG, AVIF. And vector format like PDF, SVG. See all the list in [Image coder plugin List](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Coder-Plugin-List)\n\n> \ud83d\udca1NOTE: For new user\n\nSDWebImage use [Coder Plugin System](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Coder-Plugin-List) to support both Apple's built-in and external image format. For static image we always use Apple's built-in as fallback, but not for animated image. Currently (updated to 5.19.x version) we only register traditional animated format like GIF/APNG by default, without the modern format like AWebP/HEICS/AVIF, even on the latest firmware.\n\nIf you want these animated image format support, simply register by yourself with one-line code, see more in [WebP Coder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#awebp-coder) and [HEIC Coder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#heic-coder)\n\nIn future we will change this behavior by always registering all Apple's built-in animated image format, to make it easy for new user to integrate.\n\n## Additional modules and Ecosystem\n\nIn order to keep SDWebImage focused and limited to the core features, but also allow extensibility and custom behaviors, during the 5.0 refactoring we focused on modularizing the library.\nAs such, we have moved/built new modules to [SDWebImage org](https://github.com/SDWebImage).\n\n#### SwiftUI\n[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is an innovative UI framework written in Swift to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms.\n\nWe support SwiftUI by building a brand new framework called [SDWebImageSwiftUI](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI), which is built on top of SDWebImage core functions (caching, loading and animation).\n\nThe new framework introduce two View structs `WebImage` and `AnimatedImage` for SwiftUI world, `ImageIndicator` modifier for any View, `ImageManager` observable object for data source. Supports iOS 13+/macOS 10.15+/tvOS 13+/watchOS 6+ and Swift 5.1. Have a nice try and provide feedback!\n\n#### Coders for additional image formats\n- [SDWebImageWebPCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageWebPCoder) - coder for WebP format. iOS 9+/macOS 10.11+.

(Tag 'sdwebimage')\n- If you'd like to **ask a general question**, use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sdwebimage).\n- If you **found a bug**, open an issue.\n- If you **have a feature request**, open an issue.\n- If you **need IRC channel**, use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/SDWebImage/community).\n\n## Contribution\n\n- If you **want to contribute**, read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- For **development contribution guide**, read the [How-To-Contribute](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/How-to-Contribute)\n- For **understanding code architecture**, read the [Code Architecture Analysis](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/5.6-Code-Architecture-Analysis)\n\n## How To Use\n\n* Objective-C\n\n```objective-c\n#import <SDWebImage/SDWebImage.h>\n...\n[imageView sd_setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://www.domain.com/path/to/image.jpg\"]\n             placeholderImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"placeholder.png\"]];\n```\n\n* Swift\n\n```swift\nimport SDWebImage\n\nimageView.sd_setImage(with: URL(string: \"http://www.domain.com/path/to/image.jpg\"), placeholderImage: UIImage(named: \"placeholder.png\"))\n```\n\n- For details about how to use the library and clear examples, see [The detailed How to use](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/blob/master/Docs/HowToUse.md)\n\n## Animated Images (GIF) support\n\nIn 5.0, we introduced a brand new mechanism for supporting animated images. This includes animated image loading, rendering, decoding, and also supports customizations (for advanced users).\n\nThis animated image solution is available for `iOS`/`tvOS`/`macOS`. The `SDAnimatedImage` is subclass of `UIImage/NSImage`, and `SDAnimatedImageView` is subclass of `UIImageView/NSImageView`, to make them compatible with the common frameworks APIs.\n\nThe `SDAnimatedImageView` supports the familiar image loading category methods, works like drop-in replacement for `UIImageView/NSImageView`.\n\nDon't have `UIView` (like `WatchKit` or `CALayer`)? you can still use `SDAnimatedPlayer` the player engine for advanced playback and rendering.\n\nSee [Animated Image](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#animated-image-50) for more detailed information.\n\n* Objective-C\n\n```objective-c\nSDAnimatedImageView *imageView = [SDAnimatedImageView new];\nSDAnimatedImage *animatedImage = [SDAnimatedImage imageNamed:@\"image.gif\"];\nimageView.image = animatedImage;\n```\n\n* Swift\n\n```swift\nlet imageView = SDAnimatedImageView()\nlet animatedImage = SDAnimatedImage(named: \"image.gif\")\nimageView.image = animatedImage\n```\n\n#### FLAnimatedImage integration has its own dedicated repo\nIn order to clean up things and make our core project do less things, we decided that the `FLAnimatedImage` integration does not belong here. From 5.0, this will still be available, but under a dedicated repo [SDWebImageFLPlugin](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageFLPlugin).\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are 5 ways to use SDWebImage in your project:\n- using CocoaPods\n- using Carthage\n- using Swift Package Manager\n- download binary XCFramework\n- manual install (build frameworks or embed Xcode Project)\n\n### Installation with CocoaPods\n\n[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. See the [Get Started](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) section for more details.\n\n#### Podfile\n```\nplatform :ios, '8.0'\npod 'SDWebImage', '~> 5.0'\n```\n\n##### Swift and static framework\n\nSwift project previously had to use `use_frameworks!` to make all Pods into dynamic framework to let CocoaPods work.\n\nHowever, starting with `CocoaPods 1.5.0+` (with `Xcode 9+`), which supports to build both Objective-C && Swift code into static framework. You can use modular headers to use SDWebImage as static framework, without the need of `use_frameworks!`:\n\n```\nplatform :ios, '8.0'\n# Uncomment the next line when you want all Pods as static framework\n# use_modular_headers!\npod 'SDWebImage', :modular_headers => true\n```\n\nSee more on [CocoaPods 1.5.0 \u2014 Swift Static Libraries](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.5.0/)\n\nIf not, you still need to add `use_frameworks!` to use SDWebImage as dynamic framework:\n\n```\nplatform :ios, '8.0'\nuse_frameworks!\npod 'SDWebImage'\n```\n\n#### Subspecs\n\nThere are 2 subspecs available now: `Core` and `MapKit` (this means you can install only some of the SDWebImage modules. By default, you get just `Core`, so if you need `MapKit`, you need to specify it). \n\nPodfile example:\n\n```\npod 'SDWebImage/MapKit'\n```\n\n### Installation with Carthage\n\n[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a lightweight dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C. It leverages CocoaTouch modules and is less invasive than CocoaPods.\n\nTo install with carthage, follow the instruction on [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)\n\nCarthage users can point to this repository and use whichever generated framework they'd like: SDWebImage, SDWebImageMapKit or both.\n\nMake the following entry in your Cartfile: `github \"SDWebImage/SDWebImage\"`\nThen run `carthage update`\nIf this is your first time using Carthage in the project, you'll need to go through some additional steps as explained [over at Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).\n\n> \ud83d\udca1NOTE: At this time, Carthage does not provide a way to build only specific repository subcomponents (or equivalent of CocoaPods's subspecs). All components and their dependencies will be built with the above command. However, you don't need to copy frameworks you aren't using into your project. For instance, if you aren't using `SDWebImageMapKit`, feel free to delete that framework from the Carthage Build directory after `carthage update` completes.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1NOTE: [Apple requires SDWebImage contains signatures](https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements/). So, by default the `carthage build` binary framework does not do codesign, this will cause validation error. You can sign yourself with the Apple Developer Program identity, or using the binary framework:\n\n```\nbinary \"https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/raw/master/SDWebImage.json\"\n```\n\n### Installation with Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11+)\n\n[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) (SwiftPM) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code as well as C-family dependency. From Xcode 11, SwiftPM got natively integrated with Xcode.\n\nSDWebImage support SwiftPM from version 5.1.0. To use SwiftPM, you should use Xcode 11 to open your project. Click `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency`, enter [SDWebImage repo's URL](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage.git). Or you can login Xcode with your GitHub account and just type `SDWebImage` to search.\n\nAfter select the package, you can choose the dependency type (tagged version, branch or commit). Then Xcode will setup all the stuff for you.\n\nIf you're a framework author and use SDWebImage as a dependency, update your `Package.swift` file:\n\n```swift\nlet package = Package(\n    // 5.1.0 ..< 6.0.0\n    dependencies: [\n        .package(url: \"https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage.git\", from: \"5.1.0\")\n    ],\n    // ...\n)\n```\n\n### Download binary XCFramework\n\nFrom 5.19.2, SDWebImage provide the canonical official binary XCFramework on [GitHub release pages](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/releases).\n\n+ Download XCFramework\n\nYou can choose to download `SDWebImage-dynamic.xcframework.zip` for dynamic linked one, or `SDWebImage-static.xcframework.zip` for static-linked one.\n\n+ Integrate to Xcode Project\n\nDrag the unzipped `.xcframework` into your Xcode Project's Framework tab.\n\n+ Verify signature of binary XCFramework\n\nFrom Xcode 15 Apple will verify the signature of binary XCFramework, to avoid supply chain attack.\n\nThe fingerprint currently should be `FC 3B 10 13 86 34 4C 50 DB 70 2A 9A D1 01 6F B5 1A 3E CC 8B 9D A9 B7 AE 47 A0 48 D4 D0 63 39 83`\n\nThe certificate is stored in the repo [here](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/blob/master/Certificate/SDWebImage%20Signing%20Certificate.cer)\n\nThe public key is stored in the repo [here](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/blob/master/Certificate/SDWebImage%20Signing%20Certificate.pem)\n\nSee more: [Verifying the origin of your XCFrameworks](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/verifying-the-origin-of-your-xcframeworks)\n\n\n### Manual Installation Guide\n\n+ Check your command line Xcode version\n\n```\nsudo xcode-select -s /path/to/Xcode.app\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nexport DEVELOPER_DIR=/path/to/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\n```\n\n+ Run the script to build frameworks\n\n```\n./Scripts/build-frameworks.sh\n```\n\n+ Run the script to merge XCFramework\n\n```\n./Scripts/create-xcframework.sh\n```\n\n+ Use your own certificate to sign XCFramework\n\n```\n// https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements/\ncodesign --timestamp -v --sign \"your own certificate\" SDWebImage.xcframework\n```\n\nSee more on wiki: [Manual install Guide](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Installation-Guide#manual-installation-guide)\n\n### Import headers in your source files\n\nIn the source files where you need to use the library, import the umbrella header file:\n\n```objective-c\n#import <SDWebImage/SDWebImage.h>\n```\n\nIt's also recommend to use the module import syntax, available for CocoaPods(enable `modular_headers`)/Carthage/SwiftPM.\n\n```objecitivec\n@import SDWebImage;\n```\n\n### Build Project\n\nAt this point your workspace should build without error. If you are having problem, post to the Issue and the\ncommunity can help you solve it.\n\n## Data Collection Practices\n\nFrom Xcode 15, we provide the new `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file for privacy details, see [Describing data use in privacy manifests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_data_use_in_privacy_manifests?language=objc)\n\nYou can exports the privacy report after archive your App by integrate SDWebImage via SwiftPM/XCFramework or CocoaPods (`use_frameworks` set to true).\n\nFor old version or if you're using static ar archive, as required by the [App privacy details on the App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/), here's SDWebImage's list of [Data Collection Practices](https://sdwebimage.github.io/DataCollection/index.html).\n\n\n\n## Author\n- [Olivier Poitrey](https://github.com/rs)\n\n## Collaborators\n- [Konstantinos K.](https://github.com/mythodeia)\n- [Bogdan Poplauschi](https://github.com/bpoplauschi)\n- [Chester Liu](https://github.com/skyline75489)\n- [DreamPiggy](https://github.com/dreampiggy)\n- [Wu Zhong](https://github.com/zhongwuzw)\n\n## Credits\n\nThank you to all the people who have already contributed to SDWebImage.\n\n[![Contributors](https://opencollective.com/SDWebImage/contributors.svg?width=890)](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Licenses\n\nAll source code is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Architecture\n\nTo learn about SDWebImage's architecture design for contribution, read [The Core of SDWebImage v5.6 Architecture](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/5.6-Code-Architecture-Analysis).
