So these\ntwo apps shouldn't be compared directly or be considered as an alternative to one another.\n\nIn this comparison remember, that even if app have same features they may work different(e.g. one app may have more\noptions to choose than other).\n\n|                          |   Czkawka   |   Krokiet   | FSlint |     DupeGuru      |  Bleachbit  |\n|:------------------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------:|:-----------------:|:-----------:|\n|         Language         |    Rust     |    Rust     | Python |   Python/Obj-C    |   Python    |\n| Framework base language  |      C      |    Rust     |   C    | C/C++/Obj-C/Swift |      C      |\n|        Framework         |    GTK 4    |    Slint    | PyGTK2 | Qt 5 (PyQt)/Cocoa |   PyGTK3    |\n|            OS            | Lin,Mac,Win | Lin,Mac,Win |  Lin   |    Lin,Mac,Win    | Lin,Mac,Win |\n|     Duplicate finder     |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |   \u2714    |         \u2714         |             |\n|       Empty files        |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |   \u2714    |                   |             |\n|      Empty folders       |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |   \u2714    |                   |             |\n|     Temporary files      |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |   \u2714    |                   |      \u2714      |\n|        Big files         |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |        |                   |             |\n|      Similar images      |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |        |         \u2714         |             |\n|      Similar videos      |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |        |                   |             |\n|  Music duplicates(tags)  |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |        |         \u2714         |             |\n|     Invalid symlinks     |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |   \u2714    |                   |             |\n|       Broken files       |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |        |                   |             |\n|      Names conflict      |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |   \u2714    |                   |             |\n| Invalid names/extensions |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |   \u2714    |                   |             |\n|    Installed packages    |             |             |   \u2714    |                   |             |\n|          Bad ID          |             |             |   \u2714    |                   |             |\n|  Non stripped binaries   |             |             |   \u2714    |                   |             |\n|   Redundant whitespace   |             |             |   \u2714    |                   |             |\n|    Overwriting files     |             |             |   \u2714    |                   |      \u2714      |\n|    Multiple languages    |      \u2714      |             |   \u2714    |         \u2714         |      \u2714      |\n|      Cache support       |      \u2714      |      \u2714      |        |         \u2714         |             |\n|  In active development   |     Yes     |     Yes     |   No   |        Yes        |     Yes     |\n\n## Other apps\n\nThere are many similar applications to Czkawka on the Internet, which do some things better and some things worse:\n\n### GUI\n\n- [DupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru) - Many options to customize; great photo compare tool\n- [FSlint](https://github.com/pixelb/fslint) - A little outdated, but still have some tools not available in Czkawka\n- [AntiDupl.NET](https://github.com/ermig1979/AntiDupl) - Shows a lot of metadata of compared images\n- [Video Duplicate Finder](https://github.com/0x90d/videoduplicatefinder) - Finds similar videos(surprising, isn't it),\n  supports video thumbnails\n\n### CLI\n\nDue to limited time, the biggest emphasis is on the GUI version so if you are looking for really good and feature-packed\nconsole apps, then take a look at these:\n\n- [Fclones](https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones) - One of the fastest tools to find duplicates; it is written also in\n  Rust\n- [Rmlint](https://github.com/sahib/rmlint) - Nice console interface and also is feature packed\n- [RdFind](https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind) - Fast, but written in C++ \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions to this repository are welcome.\n\nYou can help by creating:\n\n- Bug reports - memory leaks, unexpected behavior, crashes\n- Feature proposals - proposal to change/add/delete some features\n- Pull Requests - implementing a new feature yourself or fixing bugs.\n  If the change is bigger, then it's a good idea to open a new issue to discuss changes, but issues with\n  label `PR welcome` are already checked and accepted.\n- Documentation - There is an [instruction](instructions/Instruction.md) which you can improve.\n- Translations - Instruction how to translate files is available [here](instructions/Translations.md)\n- External contributions - App use big number of external libraries\n  like [lofty](https://github.com/Serial-ATA/lofty-rs), [image-rs](https://github.com/image-rs/image)\n  or [symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia) so improving this libraries will automatically improve Czkawka\n\nYou can also help by doing other things:\n\n- Creating text\n  articles - [LinuxUprising](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2021/03/find-and-remove-duplicate-files-similar.html)\n  or [Ubunlog](https://ubunlog.com/en/czkawka-finds-and-removes-empty-and-broken-duplicate-files/)\n- Adding Czkawka to repositories - [Alpine Linux](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=czkawka&branch=edge)\n  or [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/116441)\n  or [OpenMandriva](https://github.com/OpenMandrivaAssociation/czkawka)\n- Creating videos - [First Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWlRiTD4vDc)\n  or [Spanish Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9x-pHJRmKY)\n- Recommending it to others\n\n## Thanks\n\nBig thanks to P\u00e1draig Brady, creator of fantastic FSlint, because without his work I wouldn't create this tool.\n\nThanks also to all the people who create patches for this program, make it available on other systems, create videos,\narticles about it etc.\n\nAlso, I really appreciate work of people that create crates on which Czkawka is based and for that I try to report bugs\nto make it even better.\n\n## Donations\n\nIf you are using the app, I would appreciate a donation for its further development, which can be\ndone [here](https://github.com/sponsors/qarmin).\n",
