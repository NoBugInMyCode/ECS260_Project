This framework includes a suite of \nfull-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a \nvariety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include disassembly, \nassembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with hundreds of other features. Ghidra \nsupports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both \nuser-interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own Ghidra extension components \nand/or scripts using Java or Python.\n\nIn support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems \non complex SRE efforts, and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform. NSA has \napplied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious code and \ngenerating deep insights for SRE analysts who seek a better understanding of potential \nvulnerabilities in networks and systems.\n\nIf you are a U.S. citizen interested in projects like this, to develop Ghidra and other \ncybersecurity tools for NSA to help protect our nation and its allies, consider applying for a \n[career with us][career].\n\n## Security Warning\n**WARNING:** There are known security vulnerabilities within certain versions of Ghidra.  Before \nproceeding, please read through Ghidra's [Security Advisories][security] for a better understanding \nof how you might be impacted.\n\n## Install\nTo install an official pre-built multi-platform Ghidra release:  \n* Install [JDK 21 64-bit][jdk]\n* Download a Ghidra [release file][releases]\n  - **NOTE:** The official multi-platform release file is named \n    `ghidra_<version>_<release>_<date>.zip` which can be found under the \"Assets\" drop-down.\n    Downloading either of the files named \"Source Code\" is not correct for this step.\n* Extract the Ghidra release file\n* Launch Ghidra: `./ghidraRun` (`ghidraRun.bat` for Windows)\n  - or launch [PyGhidra][pyghidra]: `./support/pyGhidraRun` (`support\\pyGhidraRun.bat` for Windows)\n\nFor additional information and troubleshooting tips about installing and running a Ghidra release, \nplease refer to the [Installation Guide][installationguide] which can be found in a Ghidra release\nat `docs/InstallationGuide.html`. \n\n## Build\nTo create the latest development build for your platform from this source repository:\n\n##### Install build tools:\n* [JDK 21 64-bit][jdk]\n* [Gradle 8.5+][gradle] (or provided Gradle wrapper if Internet connection is available)\n* [Python3][python3] (version 3.9 to 3.13) with bundled pip\n* make, gcc, and g++ (Linux/macOS-only)\n* [Microsoft Visual Studio][vs] 2017+ or [Microsoft C++ Build Tools][vcbuildtools] with the\n  following components installed (Windows-only):\n  - MSVC\n  - Windows SDK\n  - C++ ATL\n\n##### Download and extract the source:\n[Download from GitHub][master]\n```\nunzip ghidra-master\ncd ghidra-master\n```\n**NOTE:** Instead of downloading the compressed source, you may instead want to clone the GitHub \nrepository: `git clone https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra.git`\n\n##### Download additional build dependencies into source repository:\n**NOTE:** If an Internet connection is available and you did not install Gradle, the following \n`gradle` commands may be replaced with `./gradle(.bat)`.\n```\ngradle -I gradle/support/fetchDependencies.gradle\n```\n\n##### Create development build: \n```\ngradle buildGhidra\n```\nThe compressed development build will be located at `build/dist/`.\n\nFor more detailed information on building Ghidra, please read the [Developer Guide][devguide].\n\nFor issues building, please check the [Known Issues][known-issues] section for possible solutions.\n\n## Develop\n\n### User Scripts and Extensions\nGhidra installations support users writing custom scripts and extensions via the *GhidraDev* plugin \nfor Eclipse.  The plugin and its corresponding instructions can be found within a Ghidra release at\n`Extensions/Eclipse/GhidraDev/` or at [this link][ghidradev].  Alternatively, Visual Studio Code may\nbe used to edit scripts by clicking the Visual Studio Code icon in the Script Manager.\nFully-featured Visual Studio Code projects can be created from a Ghidra CodeBrowser window at \n_Tools -> Create VSCode Module project_.\n\n**NOTE:** Both the *GhidraDev* plugin for Eclipse and Visual Studio Code integrations only support \ndeveloping against fully built Ghidra installations which can be downloaded from the\n[Releases][releases] page.\n\n### Advanced Development\nTo develop the Ghidra tool itself, it is highly recommended to use Eclipse, which the Ghidra \ndevelopment process has been highly customized for.\n\n##### Install build and development tools:\n* Follow the above [build instructions](#build) so the build completes without errors\n* Install [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers][eclipse]\n\n##### Prepare the development environment:\n``` \ngradle prepdev eclipse buildNatives\n```\n\n##### Import Ghidra projects into Eclipse:\n* *File* -> *Import...*\n* *General* | *Existing Projects into Workspace*\n* Select root directory to be your downloaded or cloned ghidra source repository\n* Check *Search for nested projects*\n* Click *Finish*\n\nWhen Eclipse finishes building the projects, Ghidra can be launched and debugged with the provided\n**Ghidra** Eclipse *run configuration*.\n\nFor more detailed information on developing Ghidra, please read the [Developer Guide][devguide].\n\n## Contribute\nIf you would like to contribute bug fixes, improvements, and new features back to Ghidra, please \ntake a look at our [Contributor Guide][contrib] to see how you can participate in this open \nsource project.\n\n\n[nsa]: https://www.nsa.gov\n[contrib]: CONTRIBUTING.md\n[devguide]: DevGuide.md\n[installationguide]: GhidraDocs/InstallationGuide.md\n[known-issues]: DevGuide.md#known-issues\n[career]: https://www.intelligencecareers.gov/nsa\n[releases]: https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases\n[jdk]: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases\n[gradle]: https://gradle.org/releases/\n[python3]: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n[vs]: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/\n[vcbuildtools]: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/\n[eclipse]: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/\n[master]: https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/archive/refs/heads/master.zip\n[security]: https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/security/advisories\n[ghidradev]: GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev/GhidraDevPlugin/README.md\n[pyghidra]: Ghidra/Features/PyGhidra/README.md\n",
