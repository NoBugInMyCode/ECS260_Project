If you would like to continue using, maintaining, and improving Brackets, you may fork the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/brackets). Through Adobe\u2019s partnership with Microsoft, we encourage users to migrate to [Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/brackets-to-vscode), Microsoft\u2019s free code editor built on open source.\n| ---\n\n\nWelcome to Brackets! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adobe/brackets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adobe/brackets)\n-------------------\n\nBrackets is a modern open-source code editor for HTML, CSS\nand JavaScript that's *built* in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. \n\nWhat makes Brackets different from other web code editors?\n\n* **Tools shouldn't get in your way.** Instead of cluttering up your coding\nenvironment with lots of panels and icons, the Quick Edit UI in Brackets puts \ncontext-specific code and tools inline.\n* **Brackets is in sync with your browser.** With Live Preview, Brackets\nworks directly with your browser to push code edits instantly and jump\nback and forth between your real source code and the browser view.\n* **Do it yourself.** Because Brackets is open source, and built with HTML, CSS\nand JavaScript, you can [help build](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) the best code editor for the web.\n\nBrackets may have reached version 1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our\n[trello board](http://bit.ly/BracketsTrelloBoard) that we're anxious to add and other\ninnovative web development workflows that we're planning to build into Brackets. \nSo take Brackets out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite editor. \n\nYou can see some \n[screenshots of Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Screenshots)\non the wiki, [intro videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/CodeBrackets) on YouTube, and news on the [Brackets blog](http://blog.brackets.io/).\n\nHow to install and run Brackets\n-------------------------------\n#### Download\n\nInstallers for the latest stable build for Mac, Windows and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) can be [downloaded here](http://brackets.io/).\n\n#### Usage\n\nBy default, Brackets opens a folder containing some simple \"Getting Started\" content.\nYou can choose a different folder to edit using *File > Open Folder*.\n\nMost of Brackets should be pretty self-explanatory, but for information on how\nto use its unique features, like Quick Edit and Live Preview, please read\n[How to Use Brackets](http://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets). \nAlso, see the [release notes](http://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Release-Notes)\nfor a list of new features and known issues in each build.\n\nIn addition to the core features built into Brackets, there is a large and growing\ncommunity of developers building extensions that add all sorts of useful functionality.\nSee the [Brackets Extension Registry](https://registry.brackets.io/)\nfor a list of available extensions. For installation instructions,\nsee the [extensions wiki page](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions).\n\n#### Need help?\n\nHaving problems starting Brackets the first time, or not sure how to use Brackets?  Please \nreview [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting), which helps \nyou to fix common problems and find extra help if needed.\n\nHelping Brackets\n----------------\n\n#### I found a bug!\n\nIf you found a repeatable bug, and [troubleshooting](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting) \ntips didn't help, then be sure to [search existing issues](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues) first.\nInclude steps to consistently reproduce the problem, actual vs. expected results, screenshots, and your OS and\nBrackets version number. Disable all extensions to verify the issue is a core Brackets bug.\n[Read more guidelines for filing good bugs.](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Report-an-Issue)\n\n\n#### I have a new suggestion, but don't know how to program!\n\nFor feature requests please first check our [Trello board](http://bit.ly/BracketsBacklog) to\nsee if it's already there; you can upvote it if so. If not, feel free to file it as an issue as above; we'll\nmove it to the feature backlog for you.\n\n\n#### I want to help with the code!\n\nAwesome! _There are lots of ways you can help._ First read \n[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), \nthen learn how to [pull the repo and hack on Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets).\n\nThe text editor inside Brackets is based on \n[CodeMirror](http://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror)&mdash;thanks to Marijn for\ntaking our pull requests, implementing feature requests and fixing bugs! See \n[Notes on CodeMirror](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Notes-on-CodeMirror)\nfor info on how we're using CodeMirror.\n\nAlthough Brackets is built in HTML/CSS/JS, it currently runs as a desktop \napplication in a thin native shell, so that it can access your local files.\n(If you just try to open the index.html file in a browser, it won't work yet.)\nThe native shell for Brackets lives in a separate repo, \n[adobe/brackets-shell](https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell/).\n\n\nI want to keep track of how Brackets is doing!\n----------------------------------------------\n\nNot sure you needed the exclamation point there, but we like your enthusiasm.\n\n#### What's Brackets working on next?\n\n* In our [feature backlog](http://bit.ly/BracketsBacklog), the columns to the right\n  (starting from \"Development\") list the features that we're currently working on.\n  \"Ready\" shows what we'll be working on next.\n* Watch our [GitHub activity stream](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pulse).\n* Watch our [Waffle Kanban board](https://waffle.io/adobe/brackets): Work items in [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/adobe/brackets.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/adobe/brackets) are next. The entire development process is outlined in the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Developers-Guide).\n\n#### Contact info\n\n* **E-mail:** [admin@brackets.io](mailto:admin@brackets.io)\n* **Slack:** [Brackets on Slack](https://brackets.slack.com) (You can join by sending a mail to [admin@brackets.io](mailto:admin@brackets.io) with the subject line `slack registration request` specifying the email addresses you would like to register).\n* **Developers mailing list:** http://groups.google.com/group/brackets-dev\n* **Twitter:** [@brackets](https://twitter.com/brackets)\n* **Blog:** http://blog.brackets.io/\n* **IRC:** [#brackets on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=brackets)\n\n---\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
