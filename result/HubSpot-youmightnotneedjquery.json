For example, if you have `ie8.js` and `ie9.js`, the ie9 version will be shown to people looking for a solution that works in ie9, ie10, ie11, or modern JS.\n\n## Building\n\nBuilding YMNNJQ requires Node.js\n\n1. In the project directory, run `npm install`\n1. To build the project and watch for changes, run `npm run dev`.\n1. To build the project without watching for changes, use `npm run build`.\n",
