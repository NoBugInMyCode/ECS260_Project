These GUIs are\ndeveloped independently from Stockfish and are available online. **Read the\ndocumentation for your GUI** of choice for information about how to use\nStockfish with it.\n\nSee also the Stockfish [documentation][wiki-usage-link] for further usage help.\n\n## Files\n\nThis distribution of Stockfish consists of the following files:\n\n  * [README.md][readme-link], the file you are currently reading.\n\n  * [Copying.txt][license-link], a text file containing the GNU General Public\n    License version 3.\n\n  * [AUTHORS][authors-link], a text file with the list of authors for the project.\n\n  * [src][src-link], a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a\n    Makefile that can be used to compile Stockfish on Unix-like systems.\n\n  * a file with the .nnue extension, storing the neural network for the NNUE\n    evaluation. Binary distributions will have this file embedded.\n\n## Contributing\n\n__See [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).__\n\n### Donating hardware\n\nImproving Stockfish requires a massive amount of testing. You can donate your\nhardware resources by installing the [Fishtest Worker][worker-link] and viewing\nthe current tests on [Fishtest][fishtest-link].\n\n### Improving the code\n\nIn the [chessprogramming wiki][programming-link], many techniques used in\nStockfish are explained with a lot of background information.\nThe [section on Stockfish][programmingsf-link] describes many features\nand techniques used by Stockfish. However, it is generic rather than\nfocused on Stockfish's precise implementation.\n\nThe engine testing is done on [Fishtest][fishtest-link].\nIf you want to help improve Stockfish, please read this [guideline][guideline-link]\nfirst, where the basics of Stockfish development are explained.\n\nDiscussions about Stockfish take place these days mainly in the Stockfish\n[Discord server][discord-link]. This is also the best place to ask questions\nabout the codebase and how to improve it.\n\n## Compiling Stockfish\n\nStockfish has support for 32 or 64-bit CPUs, certain hardware instructions,\nbig-endian machines such as Power PC, and other platforms.\n\nOn Unix-like systems, it should be easy to compile Stockfish directly from the\nsource code with the included Makefile in the folder `src`. In general, it is\nrecommended to run `make help` to see a list of make targets with corresponding\ndescriptions. An example suitable for most Intel and AMD chips:\n\n```\ncd src\nmake -j profile-build\n```\n\nDetailed compilation instructions for all platforms can be found in our\n[documentation][wiki-compile-link]. Our wiki also has information about\nthe [UCI commands][wiki-uci-link] supported by Stockfish.\n\n## Terms of use\n\nStockfish is free and distributed under the\n[**GNU General Public License version 3**][license-link] (GPL v3). Essentially,\nthis means you are free to do almost exactly what you want with the program,\nincluding distributing it among your friends, making it available for download\nfrom your website, selling it (either by itself or as part of some bigger\nsoftware package), or using it as the starting point for a software project of\nyour own.\n\nThe only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Stockfish in some way,\nyou MUST always include the license and the full source code (or a pointer to\nwhere the source code can be found) to generate the exact binary you are\ndistributing. If you make any changes to the source code, these changes must\nalso be made available under GPL v3.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nStockfish uses neural networks trained on [data provided by the Leela Chess Zero\nproject][lc0-data-link], which is made available under the [Open Database License][odbl-link] (ODbL).\n\n\n[authors-link]:       https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/AUTHORS\n[build-link]:         https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/actions/workflows/stockfish.yml\n[commits-link]:       https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commits/master\n[discord-link]:       https://discord.gg/GWDRS3kU6R\n[issue-link]:         https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=BUG-REPORT.yml\n[discussions-link]:   https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/discussions/new\n[fishtest-link]:      https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests\n[guideline-link]:     https://github.com/official-stockfish/fishtest/wiki/Creating-my-first-test\n[license-link]:       https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/Copying.txt\n[programming-link]:   https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page\n[programmingsf-link]: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish\n[readme-link]:        https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/README.md\n[release-link]:       https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases/latest\n[src-link]:           https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src\n[stockfish128-logo]:  https://stockfishchess.org/images/logo/icon_128x128.png\n[uci-link]:           https://backscattering.de/chess/uci/\n[website-link]:       https://stockfishchess.org\n[website-blog-link]:  https://stockfishchess.org/blog/\n[wiki-link]:          https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki\n[wiki-compile-link]:  https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki/Compiling-from-source\n[wiki-uci-link]:      https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki/UCI-&-Commands\n[wiki-usage-link]:    https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki/Download-and-usage\n[worker-link]:        https://github.com/official-stockfish/fishtest/wiki/Running-the-worker\n[lc0-data-link]:      https://storage.lczero.org/files/training_data\n[odbl-link]:          https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/odbl-10.txt\n\n[build-badge]:        https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/official-stockfish/Stockfish/stockfish.yml?branch=master&style=for-the-badge&label=stockfish&logo=github\n[commits-badge]:      https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/official-stockfish/Stockfish/latest?style=for-the-badge\n[discord-badge]:      https://img.shields.io/discord/435943710472011776?style=for-the-badge&label=discord&logo=Discord\n[fishtest-badge]:     https://img.shields.io/website?style=for-the-badge&down_color=red&down_message=Offline&label=Fishtest&up_color=success&up_message=Online&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftests.stockfishchess.org%2Ftests%2Ffinished\n[license-badge]:      https://img.shields.io/github/license/official-stockfish/Stockfish?style=for-the-badge&label=license&color=success\n[release-badge]:      https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/official-stockfish/Stockfish?style=for-the-badge&label=official%20release\n[website-badge]:      https://img.shields.io/website?style=for-the-badge&down_color=red&down_message=Offline&label=website&up_color=success&up_message=Online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstockfishchess.org\n",
