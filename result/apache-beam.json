These users want to focus on writing their application logic and have everything else just work.\n2. _SDK Writers_: Developing a Beam SDK targeted at a specific user community (Java, Python, Scala, Go, R, graphical, etc). These users are language geeks and would prefer to be shielded from all the details of various runners and their implementations.\n3. _Runner Writers_: Have an execution environment for distributed processing and would like to support programs written against the Beam Model. Would prefer to be shielded from details of multiple SDKs.\n\n### The Beam Model\n\nThe model behind Beam evolved from several internal Google data processing projects, including [MapReduce](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html), [FlumeJava](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub35650.html), and [Millwheel](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41378.html). This model was originally known as the \u201c[Dataflow Model](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1792-Akidau.pdf)\u201d.\n\nTo learn more about the Beam Model (though still under the original name of Dataflow), see the World Beyond Batch: [Streaming 101](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101) and [Streaming 102](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102) posts on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Radar site, and the [VLDB 2015 paper](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1792-Akidau.pdf).\n\nThe key concepts in the Beam programming model are:\n\n* `PCollection`: represents a collection of data, which could be bounded or unbounded in size.\n* `PTransform`: represents a computation that transforms input PCollections into output PCollections.\n* `Pipeline`: manages a directed acyclic graph of PTransforms and PCollections that is ready for execution.\n* `PipelineRunner`: specifies where and how the pipeline should execute.\n\n### SDKs\n\nBeam supports multiple language-specific SDKs for writing pipelines against the Beam Model.\n\nCurrently, this repository contains SDKs for Java, Python and Go.\n\nHave ideas for new SDKs or DSLs? See the [sdk-ideas label](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asdk-ideas).\n\n### Runners\n\nBeam supports executing programs on multiple distributed processing backends through PipelineRunners. Currently, the following PipelineRunners are available:\n\n- The `DirectRunner` runs the pipeline on your local machine.\n- The `PrismRunner` runs the pipeline on your local machine using Beam Portability.\n- The `DataflowRunner` submits the pipeline to the [Google Cloud Dataflow](http://cloud.google.com/dataflow/).\n- The `FlinkRunner` runs the pipeline on an Apache Flink cluster. The code has been donated from [dataArtisans/flink-dataflow](https://github.com/dataArtisans/flink-dataflow) and is now part of Beam.\n- The `SparkRunner` runs the pipeline on an Apache Spark cluster.\n- The `JetRunner` runs the pipeline on a Hazelcast Jet cluster. The code has been donated from [hazelcast/hazelcast-jet](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet) and is now part of Beam.\n- The `Twister2Runner` runs the pipeline on a Twister2 cluster. The code has been donated from [DSC-SPIDAL/twister2](https://github.com/DSC-SPIDAL/twister2) and is now part of Beam.\n\nHave ideas for new Runners? See the [runner-ideas label](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arunner-ideas).\n\n\nInstructions for building and testing Beam itself\nare in the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Learn More\n\nHere are some resources actively maintained by the Beam community to help you get started:\n<table>\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n      <th><b>Resource</b></th>\n      <th><b>Details</b></th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://beam.apache.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apache Beam Website</a></td>\n    <td>Our website discussing the project, and it's specifics.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://beam.apache.org/get-started/quickstart-java\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Java Quickstart</a></td>\n    <td>A guide to getting started with the Java SDK.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://beam.apache.org/get-started/quickstart-py\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python Quickstart</a></td>\n    <td>A guide to getting started with the Python SDK.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://beam.apache.org/get-started/quickstart-go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Go Quickstart </a></td>\n    <td>A guide to getting started with the Go SDK.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://tour.beam.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tour of Beam </a></td>\n    <td>A comprehensive, interactive learning experience covering Beam concepts in depth.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/724\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beam Quest </a></td>\n    <td>A certification granted by Google Cloud, certifying proficiency in Beam.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://s.apache.org/beam-community-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community Metrics </a></td>\n    <td>Beam's Git Community Metrics.</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Contact Us\n\nTo get involved with Apache Beam:\n\n* [Subscribe to](https://beam.apache.org/community/contact-us/#:~:text=Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe) or e-mail the [user@beam.apache.org](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/beam-user/) list.\n* [Subscribe to](https://beam.apache.org/community/contact-us/#:~:text=Subscribe%20and%20Unsubscribe) or e-mail the [dev@beam.apache.org](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/beam-dev/) list.\n* [Join ASF Slack](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite) on [#beam channel](https://s.apache.org/beam-slack-channel)\n* [Report an issue](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/new/choose).\n",
