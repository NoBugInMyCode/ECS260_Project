        "readme": "# vue-webpack-boilerplate\n\n> A full-featured Webpack setup with hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing & css extraction.\n\n> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible. For Vue 1.x use this command: `vue init webpack#1.0 my-project`\n\n\n# Vue-cli 3 is here, so this template is now considered deprecated.\n\nThis template was the main template for vue-cli verison 2.*.\n\nNow that we have released a [stable version of vue-cli 3](https://cli.vuejs.org), which incorporates all features that this template offers (and much more), we think that this template doesn't have any significant use for the future, so we won't put much resource in developing it further.\n\nWe will try and fix major issues should they arise, but not much more.\n\nFeel free to fork this template if you want to keep it alive.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [For this template](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack): common questions specific to this template are answered and each part is described in greater detail\n- [For Vue 2.0](http://vuejs.org/guide/): general information about how to work with Vue, not specific to this template\n\n## Usage\n\nThis is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install -g vue-cli\n$ vue init webpack my-project\n$ cd my-project\n$ npm install\n$ npm run dev\n```\n\nThis will scaffold the project using the `master` branch. If you wish to use the latest version of the webpack template, do the following instead:\n\n``` bash\n$ vue init webpack#develop my-project\n```\n\n:warning: **The develop branch is not considered stable and can contain bugs or not build at all, so use at your own risk.**\n\nThe development server will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.\n\n## What's Included\n\n- `npm run dev`: first-in-class development experience.\n  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components.\n  - State preserving hot-reload\n  - State preserving compilation error overlay\n  - Lint-on-save with ESLint\n  - Source maps\n\n- `npm run build`: Production ready build.\n  - JavaScript minified with [UglifyJS v3](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/tree/harmony).\n  - HTML minified with [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).\n  - CSS across all components extracted into a single file and minified with [cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano).\n  - Static assets compiled with version hashes for efficient long-term caching, and an auto-generated production `index.html` with proper URLs to these generated assets.\n  - Use `npm run build --report`to build with bundle size analytics.\n\n- `npm run unit`: Unit tests run in [JSDOM](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), or in PhantomJS with Karma + Mocha + karma-webpack.\n  - Supports ES2015+ in test files.\n  - Easy mocking.\n\n- `npm run e2e`: End-to-end tests with [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/).\n  - Run tests in multiple browsers in parallel.\n  - Works with one command out of the box:\n    - Selenium and chromedriver dependencies automatically handled.\n    - Automatically spawns the Selenium server.\n\n### Fork It And Make Your Own\n\nYou can fork this repo to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `vue-cli`:\n\n``` bash\nvue init username/repo my-project\n```\n",
