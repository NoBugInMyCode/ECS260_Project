Check out the [website](http://git-lfs.github.com)\nfor an overview of features.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installing\n\n#### On Linux\n\nDebian and RPM packages are available from packagecloud, see the [Linux installation instructions](INSTALLING.md).\n\n#### On macOS\n\n[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) bottles are distributed and can be installed via `brew install git-lfs`.\n\n#### On Windows\n\nGit LFS is included in the distribution of [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).\nAlternatively, you can install a recent version of Git LFS from the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager.\n\n#### From binary\n\n[Binary packages](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases) are\navailable for Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD.\nThe binary packages include a script which will:\n\n- Install Git LFS binaries onto the system `$PATH`.  On Windows in particular, you may need to restart your command shell so any change to `$PATH` will take effect and Git can locate the Git LFS binary.\n- Run `git lfs install` to perform required global configuration changes.\n\n```ShellSession\n$ ./install.sh\n```\n\nNote that Debian and RPM packages are built for multiple Linux distributions and versions for both amd64 and i386.\nFor arm64, only Debian packages are built and only for recent versions due to the cost of building in emulation.\n\n#### From source\n\n- Ensure you have the latest version of Go, GNU make, and a standard Unix-compatible build environment installed.\n- On Windows, install `goversioninfo` with `go install github.com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo/cmd/goversioninfo@latest`.\n- Run `make`.\n- Place the `git-lfs` binary, which can be found in `bin`, on your system\u2019s executable `$PATH` or equivalent.\n- Git LFS requires global configuration changes once per-machine. This can be done by\nrunning: `git lfs install`\n\n#### Verifying releases\n\nReleases are signed with the OpenPGP key of one of the core team members.  To\nget these keys, you can run the following command, which will print them to\nstandard output:\n\n```ShellSession\n$ curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/git-lfs/git-lfs/tarball/core-gpg-keys | tar -Ozxf -\n```\n\nOnce you have the keys, you can download the `sha256sums.asc` file and verify\nthe file you want like so:\n\n```ShellSession\n$ gpg -d sha256sums.asc | grep git-lfs-linux-amd64-v2.10.0.tar.gz | shasum -a 256 -c\n```\n\nFor the convenience of distributors, we also provide a wider variety of signed\nhashes in the `hashes.asc` file.  Those hashes are in the tagged BSD format, but\ncan be verified with Perl's `shasum` or the GNU hash utilities, just like the\nones in `sha256sums.asc`.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nTo begin using Git LFS within a Git repository that is not already configured\nfor Git LFS, you can indicate which files you would like Git LFS to manage.\nThis can be done by running the following _from within a Git repository_:\n\n```bash\n$ git lfs track \"*.psd\"\n```\n\n(Where `*.psd` is the pattern of filenames that you wish to track. You can read\nmore about this pattern syntax\n[here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes)).\n\n> *Note:* the quotation marks surrounding the pattern are important to\n> prevent the glob pattern from being expanded by the shell.\n\nAfter any invocation of `git-lfs-track(1)` or `git-lfs-untrack(1)`, you _must\ncommit changes to your `.gitattributes` file_. This can be done by running:\n\n```bash\n$ git add .gitattributes\n$ git commit -m \"track *.psd files using Git LFS\"\n```\n\nYou can now interact with your Git repository as usual, and Git LFS will take\ncare of managing your large files. For example, changing a file named `my.psd`\n(tracked above via `*.psd`):\n\n```bash\n$ git add my.psd\n$ git commit -m \"add psd\"\n```\n\n> _Tip:_ if you have large files already in your repository's history, `git lfs\n> track` will _not_ track them retroactively. To migrate existing large files\n> in your history to use Git LFS, use `git lfs migrate`. For example:\n>\n> ```\n> $ git lfs migrate import --include=\"*.psd\" --everything\n> ```\n>\n> **Note that this will rewrite history and change all of the Git object IDs in your\n> repository, just like the export version of this command.**\n>\n> For more information, read [`git-lfs-migrate(1)`](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-migrate.adoc).\n\nYou can confirm that Git LFS is managing your PSD file:\n\n```bash\n$ git lfs ls-files\n3c2f7aedfb * my.psd\n```\n\nOnce you've made your commits, push your files to the Git remote:\n\n```bash\n$ git push origin main\nUploading LFS objects: 100% (1/1), 810 B, 1.2 KB/s\n# ...\nTo https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs-test\n   67fcf6a..47b2002  main -> main\n```\n\n### Uninstalling\n\nIf you've decided that Git LFS isn't right for you, you can convert your\nrepository back to a plain Git repository with `git lfs migrate` as well.  For\nexample:\n\n```ShellSession\n$ git lfs migrate export --include=\"*.psd\" --everything\n```\n\n**Note that this will rewrite history and change all of the Git object IDs in your\nrepository, just like the import version of this command.**\n\nIf there's some reason that things aren't working out for you, please let us\nknow in an issue, and we'll definitely try to help or get it fixed.\n\n## Limitations\n\nGit LFS maintains a list of currently known limitations, which you can find and\nedit [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Limitations).\n\nCurrent releases of Git LFS will work with Git versions as early as\nGit 2.0.0.  However, for best performance, using a recent version of Git\nis highly recommended.\n\nGit LFS source code utilizes Go modules in its build system, and therefore this\nproject contains a `go.mod` file with a defined Go module path.  However, we\ndo not maintain a stable Go language API or ABI, as Git LFS is intended to be\nused solely as a compiled binary utility.  Please do not import the `git-lfs`\nmodule into other Go code and do not rely on it as a source code dependency.\n\n## Need Help?\n\nYou can get help on specific commands directly:\n\n```bash\n$ git lfs help <subcommand>\n```\n\nThe [official documentation](docs) has command references and specifications for\nthe tool.  There's also a [FAQ](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-faq.adoc)\nshipped with Git LFS which answers some common questions.\n\nIf you have a question on how to use Git LFS, aren't sure about something, or\nare looking for input from others on tips about best practices or use cases,\nfeel free to\n[start a discussion](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/discussions).\n\nYou can always [open an issue](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues), and\none of the Core Team members will respond to you. Please be sure to include:\n\n1. The output of `git lfs env`, which displays helpful information about your\n   Git repository useful in debugging.\n2. Any failed commands re-run with `GIT_TRACE=1` in the environment, which\n   displays additional information pertaining to why a command crashed.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on working on Git LFS and\nsending patches. Related projects are listed on the [Implementations wiki\npage](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Implementations).\n\nSee also [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for info on how to submit reports\nof security vulnerabilities.\n\n## Core Team\n\nThese are the humans that form the Git LFS core team, which runs the project.\n\nIn alphabetical order:\n\n| [@chrisd8088][chrisd8088-user] | [@larsxschneider][larsxschneider-user] |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| [![][chrisd8088-img]][chrisd8088-user] | [![][larsxschneider-img]][larsxschneider-user] |\n| [PGP 088335A9][chrisd8088-pgp] | [PGP A5795889][larsxschneider-pgp] |\n\n[chrisd8088-img]: https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/28857117?s=100&v=4\n[larsxschneider-img]: https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/477434?s=100&v=4\n[chrisd8088-user]: https://github.com/chrisd8088\n[larsxschneider-user]: https://github.com/larsxschneider\n[chrisd8088-pgp]: https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x86cd3297749375bcf8206715f54fe648088335a9\n[larsxschneider-pgp]: https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xaa3b3450295830d2de6db90caba67be5a5795889\n\n### Alumni\n\nThese are the humans that have in the past formed the Git LFS core team, or\nhave otherwise contributed a significant amount to the project.
