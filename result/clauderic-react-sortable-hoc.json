It will continue to receive critical security updates, but there are no new features planned.\n> In\u00a0future versions of React, the [`findDOMNode`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#finddomnode) method will be deprecated. This method is a critical piece of the architecture of\u00a0`react-sortable-hoc`, and the library will stop working in the future when that method is removed from `react-dom`.\n>\n> All development efforts have been redirected towards [**@dnd-kit**](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit). It provides feature parity, built with a modern and extensible architecture, supports complex use-cases and has accessibility features built-in. New consumers are strongly encouraged to adopt **@dnd-kit** instead of adopting `react-sortable-hoc`.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit\"><img alt=\"Visit @dnd-kit github repository\" src=\".github/assets/dnd-kit-banner.svg\" /></a>\n\n# <img src=\".github/assets/react-sortable-hoc-logo.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"React Sortable HOC\" />\n\n> A set of higher-order components to turn any list into an animated, accessible and touch-friendly sortable list\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-sortable-hoc.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sortable-hoc)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-sortable-hoc.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sortable-hoc)\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/blob/master/LICENSE)\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc.svg)](https://gitter.im/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc)\n![gzip size](http://img.badgesize.io/https://npmcdn.com/react-sortable-hoc/dist/react-sortable-hoc.umd.min.js?compression=gzip)\n\n### Examples available here: <a href=\"#\">http://clauderic.github.io/react-sortable-hoc/</a>\n\n## Features\n\n- **Higher Order Components** \u2013 Integrates with your existing components\n- **Drag handle, auto-scrolling, locked axis, events, and more!**\n- **Suuuper smooth animations** \u2013 Chasing the 60FPS dream \ud83c\udf08\n- **Works with virtualization libraries: [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/), [react-tiny-virtual-list](https://github.com/clauderic/react-tiny-virtual-list), [react-infinite](https://github.com/seatgeek/react-infinite), etc.**\n- **Horizontal lists, vertical lists, or a grid** \u2194 \u2195 \u2921\n- **Touch support** \ud83d\udc4c\n- **Accessible: supports keyboard sorting**\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sortable-hoc):\n\n    $ npm install react-sortable-hoc --save\n\nThen, using a module bundler that supports either CommonJS or ES2015 modules, such as [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack):\n\n```js\n// Using an ES6 transpiler like Babel\nimport {SortableContainer, SortableElement} from 'react-sortable-hoc';\n\n// Not using an ES6 transpiler\nvar Sortable = require('react-sortable-hoc');\nvar SortableContainer = Sortable.SortableContainer;\nvar SortableElement = Sortable.SortableElement;\n```\n\nAlternatively, an UMD build is also available:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"react-sortable-hoc/dist/react-sortable-hoc.umd.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic Example\n\n```js\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport {render} from 'react-dom';\nimport {SortableContainer, SortableElement} from 'react-sortable-hoc';\nimport arrayMove from 'array-move';\n\nconst SortableItem = SortableElement(({value}) => <li>{value}</li>);\n\nconst SortableList = SortableContainer(({items}) => {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map((value, index) => (\n        <SortableItem key={`item-${value}`} index={index} value={value} />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n});\n\nclass SortableComponent extends Component {\n  state = {\n    items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4', 'Item 5', 'Item 6'],\n  };\n  onSortEnd = ({oldIndex, newIndex}) => {\n    this.setState(({items}) => ({\n      items: arrayMove(items, oldIndex, newIndex),\n    }));\n  };\n  render() {\n    return <SortableList items={this.state.items} onSortEnd={this.onSortEnd} />;\n  }\n}\n\nrender(<SortableComponent />, document.getElementById('root'));\n```\n\nThat's it! React Sortable does not come with any styles by default, since it's meant to enhance your existing components.\n\nMore code examples are available [here](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/blob/master/examples/).\n\n## Why should I use this?\n\nThere are already a number of great Drag & Drop libraries out there (for instance, [react-dnd](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd/) is fantastic). If those libraries fit your needs, you should definitely give them a try first. However, most of those libraries rely on the HTML5 Drag & Drop API, which has some severe limitations. For instance, things rapidly become tricky if you need to support touch devices, if you need to lock dragging to an axis, or want to animate the nodes as they're being sorted. React Sortable HOC aims to provide a simple set of higher-order components to fill those gaps. If you're looking for a dead-simple, mobile-friendly way to add sortable functionality to your lists, then you're in the right place.\n\n### Prop Types\n\n#### SortableContainer HOC\n\n| Property                          | Type                                                      | Default                                                                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| axis                              | String                                                    | `y`                                                                                                                                                                      | Items can be sorted horizontally, vertically or in a grid.

To enable it, make sure your `SortableElement` or `SortableHandle` is focusable. This can be done by setting `tabIndex={0}` on the outermost HTML node rendered by the component you're enhancing with `SortableElement` or `SortableHandle`.\n\nOnce an item is focused/tabbed to, pressing `SPACE` picks it up, `ArrowUp` or `ArrowLeft` moves it one place backward in the list, `ArrowDown` or `ArrowRight` moves items one place forward in the list, pressing `SPACE` again drops the item in its new position. Pressing `ESC` before the item is dropped will cancel the sort operations.\n\n### Grid support\n\nNeed to sort items in a grid? We've got you covered! Just set the `axis` prop to `xy`. Grid support is currently limited to a setup where all the cells in the grid have the same width and height, though we're working hard to get variable width support in the near future.\n\n### Item disappearing when sorting / CSS issues\n\nUpon sorting, `react-sortable-hoc` creates a clone of the element you are sorting (the _sortable-helper_) and appends it to the end of the `<body>` tag. The original element will still be in-place to preserve its position in the DOM until the end of the drag (with inline-styling to make it invisible). If the _sortable-helper_ gets messed up from a CSS standpoint, consider that maybe your selectors to the draggable item are dependent on a parent element which isn't present anymore (again, since the _sortable-helper_ is at the end of the `<body>`). This can also be a `z-index` issue, for example, when using `react-sortable-hoc` within a Bootstrap modal, you'll need to increase the `z-index` of the SortableHelper so it is displayed on top of the modal (see [#87](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/issues/87) for more details).\n\n### Click events being swallowed\n\nBy default, `react-sortable-hoc` is triggered immediately on `mousedown`. If you'd like to prevent this behaviour, there are a number of strategies readily available. You can use the `distance` prop to set a minimum distance (in pixels) to be dragged before sorting is enabled. You can also use the `pressDelay` prop to add a delay before sorting is enabled. Alternatively, you can also use the [SortableHandle](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/blob/master/src/SortableHandle/index.js) HOC.\n\n### Wrapper props not passed down to wrapped Component\n\nAll props for `SortableContainer` and `SortableElement` listed above are intentionally consumed by the wrapper component and are **not** passed down to the wrapped component. To make them available pass down the desired prop again with a different name. E.g.:\n\n```js\nconst SortableItem = SortableElement(({value, sortIndex}) => (\n  <li>\n    {value} - #{sortIndex}\n  </li>\n));\n\nconst SortableList = SortableContainer(({items}) => {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map((value, index) => (\n        <SortableItem\n          key={`item-${index}`}\n          index={index}\n          sortIndex={index}\n          value={value}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n});\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nReact Sortable HOC only depends on [invariant](https://github.com/zertosh/invariant). It has the following peerDependencies: `react`, `react-dom`\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nIf believe you've found an issue, please [report it](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/issues) along with any relevant details to reproduce it. The easiest way to do so is to fork the `react-sortable-hoc` basic setup sandbox on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/o104x95y86):\n\n[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-sortable-hoc-starter-o104x95y86)\n\n## Asking for help\n\nPlease do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Instead, use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc) or StackOverflow.\n\n## Contributions\n\nYes please! Feature requests / pull requests are welcome.\n",
