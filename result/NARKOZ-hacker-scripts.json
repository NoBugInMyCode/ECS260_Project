The dude was literally living inside the terminal. You know, that type of a guy who loves Vim, creates diagrams in Dot and writes wiki-posts in Markdown... If something - anything - requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that.\n\n> xxx: So we're sitting here, looking through his, uhm, \"legacy\"\n\n> xxx: You're gonna love this\n\n> xxx: [`smack-my-bitch-up.sh`](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/smack-my-bitch-up.sh) - sends a text message \"late at work\" to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.\n\n> xxx: [`kumar-asshole.sh`](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/kumar-asshole.sh) - scans the inbox for emails from \"Kumar\" (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like \"help\", \"trouble\", \"sorry\" etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply \"no worries mate, be careful next time\".\n\n> xxx: [`hangover.sh`](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/hangover.sh) - another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like \"not feeling well/gonna work from home\" etc. Adds a random \"reason\" from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.\n\n> xxx: (and the oscar goes to) [`fucking-coffee.sh`](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/fucking-coffee.sh) - this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like `sys brew`. Turns out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and waits another 24 (!) seconds before pouring it into a cup. The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the machine from the dudes desk.\n\n> xxx: holy sh*t I'm keeping those\n\nOriginal: http://bash.im/quote/436725 (in Russian)  (Archive.org [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210226092253/http://bash.im/quote/436725))\nPull requests with other implementations (Python, Perl, Shell, etc) are welcome.\n\n## Usage\n\nYou need these environment variables:\n\n```sh\n# used in `smack-my-bitch-up` and `hangover` scripts\nTWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nTWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy\n\n# used in `kumar_asshole` script\nGMAIL_USERNAME=admin@example.org\nGMAIL_PASSWORD=password\n```\n\nFor Ruby scripts you need to install gems:\n`gem install dotenv twilio-ruby gmail`\n\n## Cron jobs\n\n```sh\n# Runs `smack-my-bitch-up.sh` monday to friday at 9:20 pm.\n20 21 * * 1-5 /path/to/scripts/smack-my-bitch-up.sh >> /path/to/smack-my-bitch-up.log 2>&1\n\n# Runs `hangover.sh` monday to friday at 8:45 am.\n45 8 * * 1-5 /path/to/scripts/hangover.sh >> /path/to/hangover.log 2>&1\n\n# Runs `kumar-asshole.sh` every 10 minutes.\n*/10 * * * * /path/to/scripts/kumar-asshole.sh\n\n# Runs `fucking-coffee.sh` hourly from 9am to 6pm on weekdays.\n0 9-18 * * 1-5 /path/to/scripts/fucking-coffee.sh\n```\n\n---\nCode is released under WTFPL.\n",
