I'm building this in public. You can follow the progress on Twitter [@shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn).\n> See the roadmap below.\n\n## About this project\n\nThis project as an experiment to see how a modern app (with features like authentication, subscriptions, API routes, static pages for docs ...etc) would work in Next.js 13 and server components.\n\n**This is not a starter template.**\n\nA few people have asked me to turn this into a starter. I think we could do that once the new features are out of beta.\n\n## Note on Performance\n\n> **Warning**\n> This app is using the unstable releases for Next.js 13 and React 18. The new router and app dir is still in beta and not production-ready.\n> **Expect some performance hits when testing the dashboard**.\n> If you see something broken, you can ping me [@shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn).\n\n## Features\n\n- New `/app` dir,\n- Routing, Layouts, Nested Layouts and Layout Groups\n- Data Fetching, Caching and Mutation\n- Loading UI\n- Route handlers\n- Metadata files\n- Server and Client Components\n- API Routes and Middlewares\n- Authentication using **NextAuth.js**\n- ORM using **Prisma**\n- Database on **PlanetScale**\n- UI Components built using **Radix UI**\n- Documentation and blog using **MDX** and **Contentlayer**\n- Subscriptions using **Stripe**\n- Styled using **Tailwind CSS**\n- Validations using **Zod**\n- Written in **TypeScript**\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [x] ~Add MDX support for basic pages~\n- [x] ~Build marketing pages~\n- [x] ~Subscriptions using Stripe~\n- [x] ~Responsive styles~\n- [x] ~Add OG image for blog using @vercel/og~\n- [x] Dark mode\n\n## Known Issues\n\nA list of things not working right now:\n\n1. ~GitHub authentication (use email)~\n2. ~[Prisma: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/task/.next/server/chunks/schema.prisma'](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/16117)~\n3. ~[Next.js 13: Client side navigation does not update head](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42414)~\n4. [Cannot use opengraph-image.tsx inside catch-all routes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48162)\n\n## Why not tRPC, Turborepo or X?\n\nI might add this later. For now, I want to see how far we can get using Next.js only.\n\nIf you have some suggestions, feel free to create an issue.\n\n## Running Locally\n\n1. Install dependencies using pnpm:\n\n```sh\npnpm install\n```\n\n2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the variables.\n\n```sh\ncp .env.example .env.local\n```\n\n3. Start the development server:\n\n```sh\npnpm dev\n```\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/shadcn/taxonomy/blob/main/LICENSE.md).\n",
