It enables\nhighlighting of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an\ninteractive terminal.  This helps in reviewing commands before running\nthem, particularly in catching syntax errors.\n\nSome examples:\n\nBefore: [![Screenshot #1.1](images/before1-smaller.png)](images/before1.png)\n<br/>\nAfter:&nbsp; [![Screenshot #1.2](images/after1-smaller.png)](images/after1.png)\n\nBefore: [![Screenshot #2.1](images/before2-smaller.png)](images/before2.png)\n<br/>\nAfter:&nbsp; [![Screenshot #2.2](images/after2-smaller.png)](images/after2.png)\n\nBefore: [![Screenshot #3.1](images/before3-smaller.png)](images/before3.png)\n<br/>\nAfter:&nbsp; [![Screenshot #3.2](images/after3-smaller.png)](images/after3.png)\n\nBefore: [![Screenshot #4.1](images/before4-smaller.png)](images/before4-smaller.png)\n<br/>\nAfter:&nbsp; [![Screenshot #4.2](images/after4-smaller.png)](images/after4-smaller.png)\n\n\n\nHow to install\n--------------\n\nSee [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).\n\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### Why must `zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh` be sourced at the end of the `.zshrc` file?\n\nzsh-syntax-highlighting works by hooking into the Zsh Line Editor (ZLE) and\ncomputing syntax highlighting for the command-line buffer as it stands at the\ntime z-sy-h's hook is invoked.\n\nIn zsh 5.2 and older,\n`zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh` hooks into ZLE by wrapping ZLE widgets.  It must\nbe sourced after all custom widgets have been created (i.e., after all `zle -N`\ncalls and after running `compinit`) in order to be able to wrap all of them.\nWidgets created after z-sy-h is sourced will work, but will not update the\nsyntax highlighting.\n\nIn zsh newer than 5.8 (not including 5.8 itself),\nzsh-syntax-highlighting uses the `add-zle-hook-widget` facility to install\na `zle-line-pre-redraw` hook.  Hooks are run in order of registration,\ntherefore, z-sy-h must be sourced (and register its hook) after anything else\nthat adds hooks that modify the command-line buffer.\n\n### Does syntax highlighting work during incremental history search?\n\nHighlighting the command line during an incremental history search (by default bound to\nto <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> in zsh's emacs keymap) requires zsh 5.4 or newer.\n\nUnder zsh versions older than 5.4, the zsh-default [underlining][zshzle-Character-Highlighting]\nof the matched portion of the buffer remains available, but zsh-syntax-highlighting's\nadditional highlighting is unavailable.  (Those versions of zsh do not provide\nenough information to allow computing the highlighting correctly.)\n\nSee issues [#288][i288] and [#415][i415] for details.\n\n[zshzle-Character-Highlighting]: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Character-Highlighting\n[i288]: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/pull/288\n[i415]: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/pull/415\n\n### How are new releases announced?\n\nThere is currently no \"push\" announcements channel.  However, the following\nalternatives exist:\n\n- GitHub's RSS feed of releases: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/releases.atom\n- An anitya entry: https://release-monitoring.org/project/7552/\n\n\nHow to tweak\n------------\n\nSyntax highlighting is done by pluggable highlighter scripts.  See the\n[documentation on highlighters](docs/highlighters.md) for details and\nconfiguration settings.\n\n[build-status]: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/actions\n[build-status-image]: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/workflows/Tests/badge.svg\n",
