Made in [Yalantis](https://yalantis.com/?utm_source=github)\n\n#### [How We Created uCrop](https://yalantis.com/blog/how-we-created-ucrop-our-own-image-cropping-library-for-android/)\n#### Check this [project on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2484752-uCrop-Image-Cropping-Library)\n\n<img src=\"preview.gif\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\">\n\n# Usage\n\n*For a working implementation, please have a look at the Sample Project - sample*\n\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yalantis.ucrop.sample&utm_source=global_co&utm_medium=prtnr&utm_content=Mar2515&utm_campaign=PartBadge&pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-all-co-pr-py-PartBadges-Oct1515-1\"><img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png\" width=\"185\" height=\"70\"/></a>\n\n1. Include the library as a local library project.\n\n\t```\n\tallprojects {\n\t   repositories {\n\t      jcenter()\n\t      maven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" }\n\t   }\n\t}\n\t```\n\n    ``` implementation 'com.github.yalantis:ucrop:2.2.10' ``` - lightweight general solution\n\n    ``` implementation 'com.github.yalantis:ucrop:2.2.9-native' ``` - get power of the native code to preserve image quality (+ about 1.5 MB to an apk size)\n\n2. Add UCropActivity into your AndroidManifest.xml\n\n    ```\n    <activity\n        android:name=\"com.yalantis.ucrop.UCropActivity\"\n        android:screenOrientation=\"portrait\"\n        android:theme=\"@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\"/>\n    ```\n\n3. The uCrop configuration is created using the builder pattern.\n\n   ```java\n   UCrop.of(sourceUri, destinationUri)\n       .withAspectRatio(16, 9)\n       .withMaxResultSize(maxWidth, maxHeight)\n       .start(context);\n   ```\n\n4. Override `onActivityResult` method and handle uCrop result.\n\n    ```java\n    @Override\n    public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK && requestCode == UCrop.REQUEST_CROP) {\n            final Uri resultUri = UCrop.getOutput(data);\n        } else if (resultCode == UCrop.RESULT_ERROR) {\n            final Throwable cropError = UCrop.getError(data);\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n5. You may want to add this to your PROGUARD config:\n\n    ```\n    -dontwarn com.yalantis.ucrop**\n    -keep class com.yalantis.ucrop** { *; }\n    -keep interface com.yalantis.ucrop** { *; }\n    ```\n\n# Customization\n\nIf you want to let your users choose crop ratio dynamically, just do not call `withAspectRatio(x, y)`.\n\nuCrop builder class has method `withOptions(UCrop.Options options)` which extends library configurations.\n\nCurrently, you can change:\n\n   * image compression format (e.g. PNG, JPEG), compression\n   * image compression quality [0 - 100]. PNG which is lossless, will ignore the quality setting.\n   * whether all gestures are enabled simultaneously\n   * maximum size for Bitmap that is decoded from source Uri and used within crop view. If you want to override the default behaviour.\n   * toggle whether to show crop frame/guidelines\n   * setup color/width/count of crop frame/rows/columns\n   * choose whether you want rectangle or oval(`options.setCircleDimmedLayer(true)`) crop area\n   * the UI colors (Toolbar, StatusBar, active widget state)\n   * and more...\n\n# Compatibility\n\n  * Library - Android ICS 4.0+ (API 14) (Android GINGERBREAD 2.3+ (API 10) for versions <= 1.3.2)\n  * Sample - Android ICS 4.0+ (API 14)\n  * CPU - armeabi armeabi-v7a x86 x86_64 arm64-v8a (for versions >= 2.1.2)\n\n# Changelog\n\n### Version: 2.2.10\n\n*   Fixed [#926](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/926)\n\n### Version: 2.2.9\n\n*   Update compileSdk and targetSdk versions up to 33\n*   Fixed [#867](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/867)\n*   Fixed [#873](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/873)\n*   And other improvements\n\n### Version: 2.2.8\n\n*   Merged pending pull requests with improvements and bugfixes\n*   Update compileSdk and targetSdk versions up to 31\n*   Add localizations\n*   Fixed [#609](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/609)\n*   Fixed [#794](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/794)\n\n\n### Version: 2.2.5\n\n*   Fixed [#584](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/584)\n*   Fixed [#598](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/598)\n*   Fixed [#543](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/543)\n*   Fixed [#602](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/602)\n*   And other improvements\n\n### Version: 2.2.4\n\n  * **AndroidX migration**\n  * Redesign\n  * Several fixes including [#550](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/550)\n\n### Version: 2.2.3\n\n  * Several fixes including [#445](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/445), [#465](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/465) and more!\n  * Material design support\n  * uCrop fragment as child fragment\n  * Added the Italian language\n\n### Version: 2.2.2\n\n* uCrop fragment added\n* bugfix\n\n### Version: 2.2.1\n\n  * Fix including [#285](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/285)\n\n### Version: 2.2\n\n  * Several fixes including [#121](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/121), [#173](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/173), [#184](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/184) and more!\n  * New APIs introduced [#149](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/149), [#186](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/186) and [#156](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/156)\n\n### Version: 2.1\n\n  * Fixes issue with EXIF data (images taken on front camera with Samsung devices mostly) [#130](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/130) [#111](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/issues/111)\n  * Added API to set custom set of aspect ratio options for the user.
