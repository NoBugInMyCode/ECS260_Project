Where possible there are some graphical\nimprovements, but functionally it should act like the terminal UI.\n\nTo checkout all the **cool features**, **installation instructions**, **configuration settings** and\nmuch more, head on over to [neovide.dev](https://neovide.dev).\n\n<br>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"website/docs/assets/BasicScreenCap.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Neovide\">\n    <em>Screenshot of Neovide running on Windows</em>\n</div>\n\n## Author Notes\n\nI've been using this as my daily driver since November 2019. It should be relatively stable, but I'm\nstill working out some kinks and ironing out some cross platform issues. In general it should be\nusable at this point, and if it isn't I consider that a bug and appreciate a report in the issues!\nAny help and ideas are also greatly appreciated.\n\nI'm also very interested in suggestions code quality/style wise when it comes to Rust. I'm pretty\nnew to the language and appreciate any critiques that you might have to offer. I won't take all of\nthem, but I promise to consider anything you might have to offer.\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under [MIT](./LICENSE).\n",
