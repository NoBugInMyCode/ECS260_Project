Thanks to [@bjia56](https://github.com/bjia56) for contributions.\n\nNetBSD support added. Thanks to [@fraggerfox](https://github.com/fraggerfox) for contributions.\n\nSee [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and latest [release](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/releases/latest) for detailed list of new features, bug fixes and new themes.\n\n##### 7 January 2024\n\nBtop release v1.3.0\n\nBig release with GPU support added for Linux and platform support for OpenBSD. Big thanks to [@romner-set](https://github.com/romner-set) (GPU support) and [@joske](https://github.com/joske) (OpenBSD support) for contributions.\nAnd a multitude of bugfixes and small changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and latest [release](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/releases/latest) for detailed list and attributions.\n\nSee news entry below for more information regarding GPU support.\n\n##### 25 November 2023\n\nGPU monitoring added for Linux!\n\nCompile from git main to try it out.\n\nUse keys `5`, `6`, `7` and `0` to show/hide the gpu monitoring boxes. `5` = Gpu 1, `6` = Gpu 2, etc.\n\nGpu stats/graphs can also be displayed in the \"Cpu box\" (not as verbose), see the cpu options menu for info and configuration.\n\nNote that the binaries provided on the release page (when released) and the continuous builds will not have gpu support enabled.\n\nBecause the GPU support relies on loading of dynamic gpu libraries, gpu support will not work when also static linking.\n\nSee [Compilation Linux](#compilation-linux) for more info on how to compile with gpu monitoring support.\n\nMany thanks to [@romner-set](https://github.com/romner-set) who wrote the vast majority of the implementation for GPU support.\n\nBig update with version bump to 1.3 coming soon.\n\n##### 28 August 2022\n\n[![btop4win](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop4win/raw/master/Img/logo.png)](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop4win)\n\nFirst release of btop4win available at https://github.com/aristocratos/btop4win\n\n<details>\n<summary>More...</summary>\n\n##### 16 January 2022\n\nRelease v1.2.0 with FreeBSD support. No release binaries for FreeBSD provided as of yet.\n\nAgain a big thanks to [@joske](https://github.com/joske) for his porting efforts!\n\nSince compatibility with Linux, macOS and FreeBSD are done, the focus going forward will be on new features like GPU monitoring.\n\n##### 13 November 2021\n\nRelease v1.1.0 with macOS support. Binaries in [continuous-build-macos](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/actions/workflows/continuous-build-macos.yml) are only x86 for now.\nmacOS binaries + installer are included for both x86 and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) in the releases.\n\nBig thank you to [@joske](https://github.com/joske) who wrote the vast majority of the implementation!\n\n##### 30 October 2021\n\nWork on the OSX [macOS] and FreeBSD branches, both initiated and mostly worked on by [@joske](https://github.com/joske), will likely be completed in the coming weeks.\nThe OSX [macOS] branch has some memory leaks that needs to be sorted out and both have some issues with the processes cpu usage calculation and other smaller issues that needs fixing.\n\nIf you want to help out, test for bugs/fix bugs or just try out the branches:\n\n**macOS / OSX**\n```bash\n# Install and use Homebrew or MacPorts package managers for easy dependency installation\nbrew install coreutils make gcc@11 lowdown\ngit clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git\ncd btop\ngit checkout OSX\ngmake\n```\n\n**FreeBSD**\n```bash\nsudo pkg install gmake gcc11 coreutils git lowdown\ngit clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git\ncd btop\ngit checkout freebsd\ngmake\n```\n\nNote that GNU make (`gmake`) is recommended but not required for macOS/OSX but it is required on FreeBSD.\n\n\n##### 6 October 2021\n\nmacOS development have been started by [@joske](https://github.com/joske), big thanks :)\nSee branch [OSX](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/tree/OSX) for current progress.\n\n##### 18 September 2021\n\nThe Linux version of btop++ is complete. Released as version 1.0.0\n\nI will be providing statically compiled binaries for a range of architectures in every release for those having problems compiling.\n\nFor compilation GCC 10 is required, GCC 11 preferred.\n\nPlease report any bugs to the [Issues](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/issues/new?assignees=aristocratos&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) page.\n\nThe development plan right now:\n\n* 1.1.0 macOS [OSX] support\n* 1.2.0 FreeBSD support\n* 1.3.0 Support for GPU monitoring\n* 1.X.0 Other platforms and features...\n\nWindows support is not in the plans as of now, but if anyone else wants to take it on, I will try to help.\n\n##### 5 May 2021\n\nThis project is gonna take some time until it has complete feature parity with bpytop, since all system information gathering will have to be written from scratch without any external libraries.\nAnd will need some help in the form of code contributions to get complete support for BSD and macOS/OSX.\n\n</details>\n\n## Documents\n\n**[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**\n\n**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**\n\n**[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**\n\n## Description\n\nResource monitor that shows usage and stats for processor, memory, disks, network and processes.\n\nC++ version and continuation of [bashtop](https://github.com/aristocratos/bashtop) and [bpytop](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop).\n\n## Features\n\n* Easy to use, with a game inspired menu system.\n* Full mouse support, all buttons with a highlighted key is clickable and mouse scroll works in process list and menu boxes.\n* Fast and responsive UI with UP, DOWN keys process selection.\n* Function for showing detailed stats for selected process.\n* Ability to filter processes.\n* Easy switching between sorting options.\n* Tree view of processes.\n* Send any signal to selected process.\n* UI menu for changing all config file options.\n* Auto scaling graph for network usage.\n* Shows IO activity and speeds for disks.\n* Battery meter\n* Selectable symbols for the graphs.\n* Custom presets\n* And more...\n\n## Themes\n\nBtop++ uses the same theme files as bpytop and bashtop (some color values missing in bashtop themes) .\n\nSee [themes](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/tree/main/themes) folder for available themes.\n\nThe `make install` command places the default themes in `[$PREFIX or /usr/local]/share/btop/themes`.\nUser created themes should be placed in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/btop/themes` or `$HOME/.config/btop/themes`.\n\nLet me know if you want to contribute with new themes.\n\n## Support and funding\n\nYou can sponsor this project through github, see [my sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/aristocratos) for options.\n\nOr donate through [paypal](https://paypal.me/aristocratos) or [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/aristocratos).\n\nAny support is greatly appreciated!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nFor best experience, a terminal with support for:\n\n* 24-bit truecolor ([See list of terminals with truecolor support](https://github.com//termstandard/colors))\n* 256-color terminals are supported through 24-bit to 256-color conversion when setting \"truecolor\" to False in the options or with \"-lc/--low-color\" arguments.\n* 16 color TTY mode will be activated if a real tty device is detected. Can be forced with \"-t/--tty_on\" arguments.\n* Wide characters (Are sometimes problematic in web-based terminals)\n\nAlso needs a UTF8 locale and a font that covers:\n\n* Unicode Block \u201cBraille Patterns\u201d U+2800 - U+28FF (Not needed in TTY mode or with graphs set to type: block or tty.)\n* Unicode Block \u201cGeometric Shapes\u201d U+25A0 - U+25FF\n* Unicode Block \"Box Drawing\" and \"Block Elements\" U+2500 - U+259F\n\n### **Optional Dependencies (Needed for GPU monitoring) (Only Linux)**\n\nGPU monitoring also requires a btop binary built with GPU support (`GPU_SUPPORT=true` flag).\n\nSee [GPU compatibility](#gpu-compatibility) section for more about compiling with GPU support.\n\n * **NVIDIA**\n\nIf you have an NVIDIA GPU you must use an official NVIDIA driver, both the closed-source and open-source ones have been verified to work.\n\nIn addition to that you must also have the nvidia-ml dynamic library installed, which should be included with the driver package of your distribution.\n\n * **AMD**\n\nIf you have an AMD GPU `rocm_smi_lib` is required, which may or may not be packaged for your distribution.\n\n * **INTEL**\n\nRequires a working C compiler if compiling from source - tested with GCC12 and Clang16.\n\nAlso requires the user to have permission to read from SYSFS.\n\nCan be set with `make setcap` (preferred) or `make setuid` or by running btop with `sudo` or equivalent.\n\n### **Notice (Text rendering issues)**\n\n* If you are having problems with the characters in the graphs not looking like they do in the screenshots, it's likely a problem with your systems configured fallback font not having support for braille characters.\n\n* See [Terminess Powerline](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Terminus/terminus-ttf-4.40.1) for an example of a font that includes the braille symbols.\n\n* See comments by @sgleizes [link](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop/issues/100#issuecomment-684036827) and @XenHat [link](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop/issues/100#issuecomment-691585587) in issue #100 for possible solutions.\n\n* If text are misaligned and you are using Konsole or Yakuake, turning off \"Bi-Directional text rendering\" is a possible fix.\n\n* Characters clipping in to each other or text/border misalignments is not bugs caused by btop, but most likely a fontconfig or terminal problem where the braille characters making up the graphs aren't rendered correctly.\n\n* Look to the creators of the terminal emulator you use to fix these issues if the previous mentioned fixes don't work for you.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n#### Main UI showing details for a selected process\n\n![Screenshot 1](Img/normal.png)\n\n#### Main UI in TTY mode\n\n![Screenshot 2](Img/tty.png)\n\n#### Main UI with custom options\n\n![Screenshot 3](Img/alt.png)\n\n#### Main-menu\n\n![Screenshot 3](Img/main-menu.png)\n\n#### Options-menu\n\n![Screenshot 4](Img/options-menu.png)\n\n#### Help-menu\n\n![Screenshot 5](Img/help-menu.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n**Binaries for Linux are statically compiled with musl and works on kernel 2.6.39 and newer**\n\n1. **Download btop-(VERSION)-(ARCH)-(PLATFORM).tbz from [latest release](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/releases/latest) and unpack to a new folder**\n\n   **Notice! Use x86_64 for 64-bit x86 systems, i486 and i686 are 32-bit!**\n\n2. **Install (from created folder)**\n\n   * **Run:**\n\n   ```bash\n   # use \"make install PREFIX=/target/dir\" to set target, default: /usr/local\n   # only use \"sudo\" when installing to a NON user owned directory\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\n3. **(Optional/Required for Intel GPU) Set extended capabilities or suid bit to btop**\n\n   Enables signal sending to any process without starting with `sudo` and can prevent /proc read permissions problems on some systems.\n\n   Is required for Intel GPU support.\n\n   * **Run:**\n\n   ```bash\n   # run after make install and use same PREFIX if any was used at install\n   sudo make setcap\n   ```\n   * **or**\n\n   ```bash\n   # run after make install and use same PREFIX if any was used at install\n   # set SU_USER and SU_GROUP to select user and group, default is root:root\n   sudo make setuid\n   ```\n\n* **Uninstall**\n\n  * **Run:**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo make uninstall\n   ```\n\n* **Show help**\n\n   ```bash\n   make help\n   ```\n\n**Binary release (from native os repo)**\n\n* **openSUSE**\n  * **Tumbleweed:**\n    ```bash\n    sudo zypper in btop\n    ```\n  * For all other versions, see [openSUSE Software: btop](https://software.opensuse.org/package/btop)\n* **Fedora**\n    ```bash\n    sudo dnf install btop\n\t```\n* **RHEL/AlmaLinux 8+**\n    ```bash\n    sudo dnf install epel-release\n\tsudo dnf install btop\n\t```\n* **FreeBSD**\n\t```sh\n\tpkg install btop\n\t```\n* **NetBSD**\n\t```sh\n\tpkg_add btop\n\t```\n\n\n**Binary release on Homebrew (macOS (x86_64 & ARM64) / Linux (x86_64))**\n\n* **[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/btop)**\n  ```bash\n  brew install btop\n  ```\n\n## Compilation Linux\n\n   Requires at least GCC 10 or Clang 16.\n\n   The makefile also needs GNU coreutils and `sed` (should already be installed on any modern distribution).\n\n   ### GPU compatibility\n\n   Btop++ supports Nvidia and AMD GPUs and Intel IGPUs out of the box on Linux x86_64, provided you have the correct drivers and libraries.\n\n   Gpu support for Nvidia or AMD will not work when static linking glibc (or musl, etc.)!\n\n   For x86_64 Linux the flag `GPU_SUPPORT` is automatically set to `true`, to manually disable gpu support set the flag to false, like:\n\n   `make GPU_SUPPORT=false` (or `cmake -DBTOP_GPU=false` with CMake)\n\n * **NVIDIA**\n\n    You must use an official NVIDIA driver, both the closed-source and [open-source](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules) ones have been verified to work.\n\n    In addition to that you must also have the `nvidia-ml` dynamic library installed, which should be included with the driver package of your distribution.\n\n * **AMD**\n\n    AMDGPU data is queried using the [ROCm SMI](https://github.com/rocm/rocm_smi_lib) library, which may or may not be packaged for your distribution. If your distribution doesn't provide a package, btop++ is statically linked to ROCm SMI with the `RSMI_STATIC=true` make flag.\n\n    This flag expects the ROCm SMI source code in `lib/rocm_smi_lib`, and compilation will fail if it's not there.
