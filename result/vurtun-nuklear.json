Any activity in this issue tracker, any pull requests, etc. will be ignored.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you in https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear\n\n*Nuklear community*\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vurtun/nuklear.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/vurtun/nuklear)\n\nThis is a minimal state immediate mode graphical user interface toolkit\nwritten in ANSI C and licensed under public domain. It was designed as a simple\nembeddable user interface for application and does not have any dependencies,\na default render backend or OS window and input handling but instead provides a very modular\nlibrary approach by using simple input state for input and draw\ncommands describing primitive shapes as output. So instead of providing a\nlayered library that tries to abstract over a number of platform and\nrender backends it only focuses on the actual UI.\n\n## Features\n\n- Immediate mode graphical user interface toolkit\n- Single header library\n- Written in C89 (ANSI C)\n- Small codebase (~18kLOC)\n- Focus on portability, efficiency and simplicity\n- No dependencies (not even the standard library if not wanted)\n- Fully skinnable and customizable\n- Low memory footprint with total memory control if needed or wanted\n- UTF-8 support\n- No global or hidden state\n- Customizable library modules (you can compile and use only what you need)\n- Optional font baker and vertex buffer output\n- [Documentation](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/vurtun/nuklear/master/doc/nuklear.html)\n\n## Building\n\nThis library is self contained in one single header file and can be used either\nin header only mode or in implementation mode. The header only mode is used\nby default when included and allows including this header in other headers\nand does not contain the actual implementation.\n\nThe implementation mode requires to define  the preprocessor macro\n`NK_IMPLEMENTATION` in *one* .c/.cpp file before `#include`ing this file, e.g.:\n```c\n#define NK_IMPLEMENTATION\n#include \"nuklear.h\"\n```\nIMPORTANT: Every time you include \"nuklear.h\" you have to define the same optional flags.\nThis is very important not doing it either leads to compiler errors or even worse stack corruptions.\n\n## Gallery\n\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8057201/11761525/ae06f0ca-a0c6-11e5-819d-5610b25f6ef4.gif)\n![screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8057201/13538240/acd96876-e249-11e5-9547-5ac0b19667a0.png)\n![screen2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8057201/13538243/b04acd4c-e249-11e5-8fd2-ad7744a5b446.png)\n![node](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8057201/9976995/e81ac04a-5ef7-11e5-872b-acd54fbeee03.gif)\n![skinning](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8057201/15991632/76494854-30b8-11e6-9555-a69840d0d50b.png)\n![gamepad](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8057201/14902576/339926a8-0d9c-11e6-9fee-a8b73af04473.png)\n\n## Example\n\n```c\n/* init gui state */\nstruct nk_context ctx;\nnk_init_fixed(&ctx, calloc(1, MAX_MEMORY), MAX_MEMORY, &font);\n\nenum {EASY, HARD};\nstatic int op = EASY;\nstatic float value = 0.6f;\nstatic int i =  20;\n\nif (nk_begin(&ctx, \"Show\", nk_rect(50, 50, 220, 220),\n    NK_WINDOW_BORDER|NK_WINDOW_MOVABLE|NK_WINDOW_CLOSABLE)) {\n    /* fixed widget pixel width */\n    nk_layout_row_static(&ctx, 30, 80, 1);\n    if (nk_button_label(&ctx, \"button\")) {\n        /* event handling */\n    }\n\n    /* fixed widget window ratio width */\n    nk_layout_row_dynamic(&ctx, 30, 2);\n    if (nk_option_label(&ctx, \"easy\", op == EASY)) op = EASY;\n    if (nk_option_label(&ctx, \"hard\", op == HARD)) op = HARD;\n\n    /* custom widget pixel width */\n    nk_layout_row_begin(&ctx, NK_STATIC, 30, 2);\n    {\n        nk_layout_row_push(&ctx, 50);\n        nk_label(&ctx, \"Volume:\", NK_TEXT_LEFT);\n        nk_layout_row_push(&ctx, 110);\n        nk_slider_float(&ctx, 0, &value, 1.0f, 0.1f);\n    }\n    nk_layout_row_end(&ctx);\n}\nnk_end(&ctx);\n```\n![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8057201/10187981/584ecd68-675c-11e5-897c-822ef534a876.png)\n\n## Bindings\nThere are a number of nuklear bindings for different languges created by other authors.\nI cannot atest for their quality since I am not necessarily proficient in either of these\nlanguages.
