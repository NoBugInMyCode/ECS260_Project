The parse method uses the eval method to do the\nparsing, guarding it with several regular expressions to defend against\naccidental code execution hazards. On current browsers, this file does nothing,\npreferring the built-in JSON object. There is no reason to use this file unless\nfate compels you to support IE8, which is something that no one should ever\nhave to do again.\n\ncycle.js: This file contains two functions, JSON.decycle and JSON.retrocycle,\nwhich make it possible to encode cyclical structures and dags in JSON, and to\nthen recover them. This is a capability that is not provided by ES5. JSONPath\nis used to represent the links. [http://GOESSNER.net/articles/JsonPath/]\n",
