The course covers all aspects of Rust,\nfrom basic syntax to generics and error handling. It also includes deep dives on\n[Android], [Chromium], [bare-metal], and [concurrency].\n\n[Android]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/android.html\n[Chromium]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/chromium.html\n[bare-metal]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/bare-metal.html\n[concurrency]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency.html\n\nRead the course at **https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/**.\n\n## Course Format and Target Audience\n\nThe course is used internally at Google when teaching Rust to experienced\nsoftware engineers. They typically have a background in C++ or Java.\n\nThe course is taught in a classroom setting and we hope it will be useful for\nothers who want to teach Rust to their team. The course will be less useful for\nself-study since you miss out on the discussions happening in the classroom. You\ndon't see the questions and answers and you don't see the compiler errors we\ntrigger when going through the code samples. We hope to improve on this via\n[speaker notes](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/53) and by\n[publishing videos](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/52).\n\n## Press\n\nArticles and blog posts from around the web which cover Comprehensive Rust:\n\n- 2023-09-08:\n  _[Teaching Rust in 5 days](https://mo8it.com/blog/teaching-rust/)_.\n  Comprehensive Rust was used as a base for a 5-day university class on Rust.\n- 2023-09-21:\n  _[Scaling Rust Adoption Through Training](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/09/scaling-rust-adoption-through-training.html)_.\n  We published a blog post with details on the development of the course.\n- 2023-10-02:\n  _[In Search of Rust Developers, Companies Turn to In-House Training](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/google-microsoft-take-refuge-in-rust-languages-better-security)_.\n  About how Microsoft, Google, and others are training people in Rust.\n- 2024-10-18:\n  _[Rust Training at Scale | Rust Global @ RustConf 2024](https://youtu.be/7h5KyMqt2-Q?si=4M99HdWWxMaqN8Zr)_.\n  What Google learnt from teaching Comprehensive Rust for more than two years.\n\n## Building\n\nThe course is built using a few tools:\n\n- [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)\n- [mdbook-svgbob](https://github.com/boozook/mdbook-svgbob)\n- [mdbook-i18n-helpers and i18n-report](https://github.com/google/mdbook-i18n-helpers)\n- [mdbook-exerciser](mdbook-exerciser/)\n- [mdbook-course](mdbook-course/)\n\nIn addition,\n[mdbook-linkcheck](https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/mdbook-linkcheck) checks\nthe internal links.\n\nFirst install Rust by following the instructions on https://rustup.rs/. Then\nclone this repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/\ncd comprehensive-rust\n```\n\nThen install these tools with:\n\n```shell\ncargo install mdbook\ncargo install --locked mdbook-svgbob\ncargo install --locked mdbook-i18n-helpers\ncargo install --locked i18n-report\ncargo install --locked mdbook-linkcheck\ncargo install --locked --path mdbook-exerciser\ncargo install --locked --path mdbook-course\n```\n\nRun\n\n```shell\nmdbook test\n```\n\nto test all included Rust snippets. Run\n\n```shell\nmdbook serve\n```\n\nto start a web server with the course. You'll find the content on\n<http://localhost:3000>. You can use `mdbook build` to create a static version\nof the course in the `book/` directory. Note that you have to separately build\nand zip exercises and add them to `book/html`. To build any of the translated\nversions of the course, run `MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=xx mdbook build -d book/xx`\nwhere `xx` is the ISO 639 language code (e.g. `da` for the Danish translation).\n[TRANSLATIONS.md](TRANSLATIONS.md) contains further instructions.\n\n> **Note** On Windows, you need to enable symlinks\n> (`git config --global core.symlinks true`) and Developer Mode.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe would like to receive your contributions. Please see\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions or comments, please contact\n[Martin Geisler](mailto:mgeisler@google.com) or start a\n[discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/discussions).\nWe would love to hear from you.\n",
