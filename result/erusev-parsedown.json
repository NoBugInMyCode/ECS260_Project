Additionally Parsedown will apply sanitisation to additional scripting vectors (such as scripting link destinations) that are introduced by the markdown syntax itself.\n\nTo tell Parsedown that it is processing untrusted user-input, use the following:\n\n```php\n$Parsedown->setSafeMode(true);\n```\n\nIf instead, you wish to allow HTML within untrusted user-input, but still want output to be free from XSS it is recommended that you make use of a HTML sanitiser that allows HTML tags to be whitelisted, like [HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/).\n\nIn both cases you should strongly consider employing defence-in-depth measures, like [deploying a Content-Security-Policy](https://scotthelme.co.uk/content-security-policy-an-introduction/) (a browser security feature) so that your page is likely to be safe even if an attacker finds a vulnerability in one of the first lines of defence above.\n\nSafe mode does not necessarily yield safe results when using extensions to Parsedown. Extensions should be evaluated on their own to determine their specific safety against XSS.\n\n## Escaping HTML\n\n> WARNING: This method is not safe from XSS!\n\nIf you wish to escape HTML in trusted input, you can use the following:\n\n```php\n$Parsedown->setMarkupEscaped(true);\n```\n\nBeware that this still allows users to insert unsafe scripting vectors, ex: `[xss](javascript:alert%281%29)`.\n\n## Questions\n\n**How does Parsedown work?**\n\nIt tries to read Markdown like a human. First, it looks at the lines. It\u2019s interested in how the lines start. This helps it recognise blocks. It knows, for example, that if a line starts with a `-` then perhaps it belongs to a list. Once it recognises the blocks, it continues to the content. As it reads, it watches out for special characters. This helps it recognise inline elements (or inlines).\n\nWe call this approach \"line based\". We believe that Parsedown is the first Markdown parser to use it. Since the release of Parsedown, other developers have used the same approach to develop other Markdown parsers in PHP and in other languages.\n\n**Is it compliant with CommonMark?**\n\nIt passes most of the CommonMark tests. Most of the tests that don't pass deal with cases that are quite uncommon. Still, as CommonMark matures, compliance should improve.\n\n**Who uses it?**\n\n[Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/), [Bolt CMS](http://bolt.cm/), [Grav CMS](http://getgrav.org/), [Herbie CMS](http://www.getherbie.org/), [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com/), [October CMS](http://octobercms.com/), [Pico CMS](http://picocms.org), [Statamic CMS](http://www.statamic.com/), [phpDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org/), [RaspberryPi.org](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), [Symfony Demo](https://github.com/symfony/demo) and [more](https://packagist.org/packages/erusev/parsedown/dependents).\n\n**How can I help?**\n\nUse it, star it, share it and if you feel generous, [donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=528P3NZQMP8N2).\n\n**What else should I know?**\n\nI also make [Nota](https://nota.md/) \u2014 a notes app designed for local Markdown files.\n",
