The guiding principles behind imgproxy are security, speed, and simplicity.\n\nimgproxy is able to quickly and easily resize images on the fly, and it's well-equipped to handle a large amount of image resizing. imgproxy is a fast, secure replacement for all the image resizing code inside your web application (such as resizing libraries, or code that calls ImageMagick or GraphicsMagic). It's also an indispensable tool for processing images from a remote source. With imgproxy, you don\u2019t need to repeatedly prepare images to fit your design every time it changes.\n\nTo get an even better introduction, and to dive deeper into the nitty gritty details, check out this article: [imgproxy: Resize your images instantly and securely](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/introducing-imgproxy)\n\n#### Simplicity\n\n> \"No code is better than no code.\"\n\nimgproxy only includes the must-have features for image processing, fine-tuning, and security. Specifically,\n\n* It would be great to be able to flip images, apply masks, or round corners, but in most cases, it is possible \u2014 and is much easier \u2014 to do that using CSS.\n* It may be great to have built-in HTTP caching of some kind, but it is way better to use a Content-Delivery Network or a caching proxy server for this, as you will have to do this sooner or later in the production environment.\n* It might be useful to have everything built in \u2014 such as HTTPS support \u2014 but, again, an easy way to solve that would be just to use a proxying HTTP server, a load balancer, or a CDN.\n\n#### Speed\n\nimgproxy takes advantage of probably the most efficient image processing library out there \u2013 `libvips`. It\u2019s scary fast and comes with a very low memory footprint. Thanks to libvips, we can readily and extemporaneously process a massive amount of images.\n\nimgproxy uses Go\u2019s raw (no wrappers) native `net/http` package to omit any overhead while processing requests and provides the best possible HTTP support.\n\nYou can take a look at some benchmarking results and compare imgproxy with some well-known alternatives in our [benchmark report](https://imgproxy.net/blog/image-processing-servers-benchmark/).\n\n#### Security\n\nIn terms of security, the massive processing of remote images is a potentially dangerous endeavor. There are a number of possible attack vectors, so it\u2019s a good idea to take an approach that considers attack prevention measures as a priority. Here\u2019s how imgproxy does this:\n\n* imgproxy checks the image type and its \u201creal\u201d dimensions when downloading. The image will not be fully downloaded if it has an unknown format or if the dimensions are too big (you can set the max allowed dimensions). This is how imgproxy protects from so-called \"image bombs\u201d, like those described in [this doc](https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/deflate.html).\n\n* imgproxy protects image URLs with a signature, so an attacker cannot enact a denial-of-service attack by requesting multiple image resizes.\n\n* imgproxy supports authorization by HTTP header. This prevents imgproxy from being used directly by an attacker but allows it to be used via a CDN or a caching server \u2014 simply by adding a header to a proxy or CDN config.\n\n## Usage\n\nCheck out our \ud83d\udcd1 [Documentation](https://docs.imgproxy.net).\n\n## Author\n\nSergey \"[DarthSim](https://github.com/DarthSim)\" Alexandrovich\n\n## Special thanks\n\nMany thanks to:\n\n* [Evil Martians](https://evilmartians.com) for providing a steady launch pad for imgproxy\n* [Roman Shamin](https://github.com/romashamin) for the awesome logo\n* [Alena Kirdina](https://github.com/egodyston), [Alexander Madyankin](https://github.com/madyankin), and [Aleksandr Slepchenkov](https://github.com/AleksandrSl) for the great website\n* [John Cupitt](https://github.com/jcupitt) and [Kleis Auke Wolthuizen](https://github.com/kleisauke) for developing [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) and for helping me optimize its usage with imgproxy\n* [Kirill Kuznetsov](https://github.com/dragonsmith) and [Andrew Kozin](https://github.com/nepalez) for the [Helm chart](https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy-helm)\n* [Travis Turner](https://github.com/Travis-Turner) and [Andy Baranov](https://github.com/progapandist) for keeping the documentation in good shape\n\n## License\n\nimgproxy is licensed under the MIT license.\n\nSee [LICENSE](https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy/blob/master/LICENSE) for the full license text.\n\n## Security Contact\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please contact us at security@imgproxy.net.
