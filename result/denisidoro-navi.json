Suggested values for arguments are dynamically displayed in a list.\n\n## Pros\n\n- it will spare you from knowing CLIs by heart\n- it will spare you from copy-pasting output from intermediate commands\n- it will make you type less\n- it will teach you new one-liners\n\nIt uses [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim), or [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) under the hood and it can be either used as a command or as a shell widget (_\u00e0 la_ Ctrl-R).\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Cheatsheet repositories](#cheatsheet-repositories)\n- [Cheatsheet syntax](#cheatsheet-syntax)\n- [Customization](#customization)\n- [More info](#more-info)\n- [Trying out online](#trying-out-online)\n- [Similar tools](#similar-tools)\n- [Etymology](#etymology)\n\n## Installation\n\n**navi** can be installed with the following package managers:\n\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/navi.svg)](https://repology.org/project/navi/versions)\n\nThe recommended way to install **navi** is by running:\n\n```sh\nbrew install navi\n```\n\nIf `brew` isn't available, you can check [alternative install instructions](docs/installation.md).\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are multiple ways to use **navi**:\n\n- by typing `navi` in the terminal\n  - pros: you have access to all possible subcommands and flags\n- as a [shell widget](docs/installation.md#installing-the-shell-widget) for the terminal\n  - pros: the shell history is correctly populated (i.e. with the actual command you ran instead of `navi`) and you can edit the command as you wish before executing it\n- as a [Tmux widget](docs/tmux.md)\n  - pros: you can use your cheatsheets in any command-line app even in SSH sessions\n- as [aliases](docs/cheatsheet_syntax.md#aliases)\n- as a [shell scripting tool](docs/shell_scripting.md)\n- as an [Alfred workflow](docs/alfred.md)\n\nIn particular, check [these instructions](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/issues/491) if you want to replicate what's shown in the demo above.\n\n## Cheatsheet repositories\n\nRunning **navi** for the first time will help you download and manage cheatsheets. By default, they are stored at `~/.local/share/navi/cheats/`.\n\nYou can also:\n\n- [browse through featured cheatsheets](docs/cheatsheet_repositories.md#browsing-through-cheatsheet-repositories)\n- [import cheatsheets from git repositories](docs/cheatsheet_repositories.md#importing-cheatsheets)\n- [write your own cheatsheets](#cheatsheet-syntax) (and [share them](docs/cheatsheet_repositories.md#submitting-cheatsheets), if you want)\n- [use cheatsheets from other tools](docs/cheatsheet_repositories.md#using-cheatsheets-from-other-tools), such as [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) and [cheat.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh)\n- [auto-update repositories](docs/cheatsheet_repositories.md#auto-updating-repositories)\n- auto-export cheatsheets from your [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) notes using a [TiddlyWiki plugin](https://bimlas.github.io/tw5-navi-cheatsheet/)\n\n## Cheatsheet syntax\n\nCheatsheets are described in `.cheat` files that look like this:\n\n```sh\n% git, code\n\n# Change branch\ngit checkout <branch>\n\n$ branch: git branch | awk '{print $NF}'\n```\n\nThe full syntax and examples can be found [here](docs/cheatsheet_syntax.md).\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can:\n\n- [setup your own config file](docs/navi_config.md)\n- [set custom paths for your config file and cheat sheets](docs/navi_config.md#paths-and-environment-variables)\n- [change colors](docs/navi_config.md#changing-colors)\n- [resize columns](docs/navi_config.md#resizing-columns)\n- [change how search is performed](docs/navi_config.md#overriding-fzf-options)\n\n## More info\n\nPlease run the following command to read more about all possible options:\n\n```sh\nnavi --help\n```\n\nIn addition, please check the [/docs](docs) folder.\n\n## Similar tools\n\nThere are many similar projects out there ([beavr](https://github.com/denisidoro/beavr), [bro](https://github.com/hubsmoke/bro), [cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat), [cheat.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh), [cmdmenu](https://github.com/amacfie/cmdmenu), [eg](https://github.com/srsudar/eg), [how2](https://github.com/santinic/how2), [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi), [Command Line Interface Pages](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages) and [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr), to name a few).\n\nThey are excellent projects, but **navi** remains unique in the following ways:\n\n- it's natural to write cheatsheets tailored to your needs\n- arguments are neither hardcoded nor a simple template\n\n## Etymology\n\n[Navi](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Navi) is a character from [The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Ocarina_of_Time) that provides [Link](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Link) with a variety of clues to help him solve puzzles and make progress in his quest.\n",
