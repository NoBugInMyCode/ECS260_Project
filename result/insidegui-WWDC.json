You can also read transcripts of sessions and easily jump to a specific point in the relevant video. Transcripts are also searchable and available in multiple languages.\n\n![videos](./img/v7/Transcript.webp)\n\n### Features\n\n- Watch videos in 0.5x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x or 2x speeds\n- Fullscreen and native picture-in-picture support\n- Navigate video contents easily with the help of transcripts\n\n### Clip Sharing\n\nClip Sharing allows you to share a short segment (up to 5 minutes) from a session\u2019s video. This is a great feature for quickly sharing snippets of content from the conference.\n\n![clipsharing](./img/v7/ClipSharing.webp)\n\n## Bookmarks\n\nHave you ever found yourself watching a WWDC session and wishing you could take notes at a specific point in the video to refer back to later on? This is now possible with bookmarks.\n\nWith bookmarks, you can create a reference point within a video and add an annotation to it. Your bookmark annotations can also be considered while using the search, so it\u2019s easier than ever to find the content you've bookmarked before.\n\n![bookmarks](./img/v7/Video-Bookmark.webp)\n\n## iCloud Sync\n\nEnable the iCloud sync feature in preferences and your favorites, bookmarks and progress in sessions will be synced across your Macs.\n\n## Sharing\n\nYou can easily share links to sessions or videos by using the share button. The links shared are universal links that redirect to Apple\u2019s developer website, so if they\u2019re opened on a Mac which has the app installed, they will open in the app. The links are also compatible with iOS devices using the Apple Developer app.\n\n## Nerdy bits \ud83e\udd13\n\n### Code of Conduct\nWe expect all of our contributors to help uphold the values set out in our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We fundamentally believe this will help us build a better community, and with it a better app.\n\n### Contributing\n\nPlease read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening an issue or pull request.\n\n### External libraries\n\nA number of third-party libraries are used by the app:\n\n- [Realm](https://realm.io): data storage and caching\n- [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/): automatic updates\n- [CloudKitCodable](https://github.com/insidegui/CloudKitCodable): sync support\n- [Siesta](http://bustoutsolutions.github.io/siesta/): networking\n- [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift): reactive extensions\n- [RxRealm](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxRealm): reactive extensions for Realm\n\n### Internal libraries\n\n- **ConfCore** is the core of the app that deals with Apple's WWDC API, data storage, caching, syncing and transcripts (everything that has to do with data, basically)\n- **ConfUIFoundation** contains shared color, font definitions and other useful extensions used by the main app target and `PlayerUI`\n- **PlayerUI** contains the UI components for the video player and some general-purpose UI components used throughout the app\n\n## Building the app\n\n**Building requires Xcode 14 or later.**\n\n**Clone this branch and before opening the project, run `./bootstrap.sh`** to setup the environment. The script will ask for your Apple Developer team ID in order to configure the project. There's no need to change any code signing settings in Xcode. The bootstrap script will also install `swiftlint` for you using `brew` if you don\u2019t have it yet.\n\nSince the app uses CloudKit, when you build it yourself, all CloudKit-related functionality will be disabled.\n\n**Always use the `WWDC` scheme when building** (the one that doesn't mention iCloud in its name).\n\n![schedule](./img/v7/BuildTarget.webp)\n\n### Clearing app data during development\n\nIf you need to clear the app\u2019s preferences and stored data during development, you can run `./cleardata.sh` in the project folder. **This will delete all of your preferences and data like favorites, bookmarks and progress in videos, so be careful**.\n\n<a href=\"https://macstadium.com\" title=\"The unofficial WWDC app is using MacStadium\"><img src=\"./img/MacStadiumOSS.png\" alt=\"Powered by MacStadium\"></a>",
