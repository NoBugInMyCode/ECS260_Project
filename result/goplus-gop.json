We have made many efforts to make the code more intuitive and closer to natural language expression. These include:\n\n| Go code | Go+ code | Note |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| package main<br><br>import \"fmt\"<br><br>func main() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fmt.Println(\"Hi\")<br>} | import \"fmt\"<br><br>fmt.Println(\"Hi\")<br> | Program structure: Go+ allows omitting `package main` and `func main` |\n| fmt.Println(\"Hi\") | echo(\"Hi\") | More builtin functions: It simplifies the expression of the most common tasks |\n| fmt.Println(\"Hi\") | echo \"Hi\" | Command-line style code: It reduces the number of parentheses in the code as much as possible, making it closer to natural language |\n| a := []int{1, 2, 3} | a := [1, 2, 3] | List literals |\n| a := map[string]int{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Monday\": 1,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Tuesday\": 2,<br>} | a := {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Monday\": 1,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Tuesday\": 2,<br>} | Mapping literals |\n| OnStart(func() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>}) | onStart => {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>} | Lambda expressions |\n| type Rect struct {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Width&nbsp; float64<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Height float64<br>}<br><br>func (this *Rect) Area() float64 { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return this.Width * this.Height<br>} | var (<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Width&nbsp; float64<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Height float64<br>)<br><br>func Area() float64 { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return Width * Height<br>} | [Go+ Classfiles](doc/classfile.md): We can express OOP with global variables and functions. |\n\nFor more details, see [The Go+ Mini Specification](doc/spec-mini.md).\n\n\n## Importing C/C++ and Python libraries\n\nGo+ can choose different Go compilers as its underlying support. Currently known supported Go compilers include:\n\n* [go](https://go.dev/) (The official Go compiler supported by Google)\n* [llgo](https://github.com/goplus/llgo) (The Go compiler supported by the Go+ team)\n* [tinygo](https://tinygo.org/) (A Go compiler for small places)\n\nCurrently, Go+ defaults to using [go](https://go.dev/) as its underlying support, but in the future, it will be [llgo](https://github.com/goplus/llgo).\n\nLLGo is a Go compiler based on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) in order to better integrate Go with the C ecosystem including Python. It aims to expand the boundaries of Go/Go+, providing limitless possibilities such as:\n\n* Game development\n* AI and data science\n* WebAssembly\n* Embedded development\n* ...\n\nIf you wish to use [llgo](https://github.com/goplus/llgo), specify the `-llgo` flag when initializing a Go+ module:\n\n```sh\ngop mod init -llgo YourModulePath\n```\n\nThis will generate a `go.mod` file with the following contents (It may vary slightly depending on the versions of local Go+ and LLGo):\n\n```go\nmodule YourModulePath\n\ngo 1.21 // llgo 1.0\n\nrequire github.com/goplus/llgo v0.9.9\n```\n\nBased on LLGo, Go+ can import libraries written in C/C++ and Python.\n\nHere is an example (see [chello](demo/_llgo/chello/hello.gop)) of printing `Hello world` using C's `printf`:\n\n```go\nimport \"c\"\n\nc.printf c\"Hello world\\n\"\n```\n\nHere, `c\"Hello world\\n\"` is a syntax supported by Go+, representing a null-terminated C-style string.\n\nTo run this example, you can:\n\n```sh\ncd YourModulePath  # set work directory to your module\ngop mod tidy       # for generating go.sum file\ngop run .\n```\n\nAnd here is an example (see [pyhello](demo/_llgo/pyhello/hello.gop)) of printing `Hello world` using Python's `print`:\n\n```go\nimport \"py/std\"\n\nstd.print py\"Hello world\"\n```\n\nHere, `py\"Hello world\"` is a syntax supported by Go+, representing a Python string.\n\nHere are more examples of Go+ calling C/C++ and Python libraries:\n\n* [pytensor](demo/_llgo/pytensor/tensor.gop): a simple demo using [py/torch](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goplus/llgo/py/torch)\n* [tetris](demo/_llgo/tetris/tetris.gop): a tetris game based on [c/raylib](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goplus/llgo/c/raylib)\n* [sqlitedemo](demo/_llgo/sqlitedemo/sqlitedemo.gop): a demo using [c/sqlite](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goplus/llgo/c/sqlite)\n\nTo find out more about LLGo/Go+'s support for C/C++ and Python in detail, please refer to homepage of [llgo](https://github.com/goplus/llgo).\n\n\n## Go+ Classfiles\n\n```\nOne language can change the whole world.\nGo+ is a \"DSL\" for all domains.\n```\n\nRob Pike once said that if he could only introduce one feature to Go, he would choose `interface` instead of `goroutine`. `classfile` is as important to Go+ as `interface` is to Go.\n\nIn the design philosophy of Go+, we do not recommend `DSL` (Domain Specific Language). But `SDF` (Specific Domain Friendliness) is very important. The Go+ philosophy about `SDF` is:\n\n```\nDon't define a language for specific domain.\nAbstract domain knowledge for it.\n```\n\nGo+ introduces `classfile` to abstract domain knowledge.\n\n* [What's Classfile?](doc/classfile.md#whats-classfile)\n* [Dive into Go+ Classfiles](doc/classfile.md)\n\nSound a bit abstract? Let's see some Go+ classfiles.\n\n* Unit Test: [classfile: Unit Test](https://github.com/goplus/gop/blob/main/doc/classfile.md#classfile-unit-test)\n* DevOps: [gsh: Go+ DevOps Tools](https://github.com/qiniu/x/tree/main/gsh)\n* Web Programming: [yap: Yet Another HTTP Web Framework](https://github.com/goplus/yap)\n* Web Programming: [yaptest: HTTP Test Framework](https://github.com/goplus/yap/tree/main/ytest)\n* Web Programming: [ydb: Database Framework](https://github.com/goplus/yap/tree/main/ydb)\n* STEM Education: [spx: A Go+ 2D Game Engine](https://github.com/goplus/spx)\n\n\n### yap: Yet Another HTTP Web Framework\n\nThis classfile has the file suffix `.yap`.\n\nCreate a file named [get.yap](https://github.com/goplus/yap/blob/main/demo/classfile2_hello/get.yap) with the following content:\n\n```go\nhtml `<html><body>Hello, YAP!</body></html>`\n```\n\nExecute the following commands:\n\n```sh\ngop mod init hello\ngop get github.com/goplus/yap@latest\ngop mod tidy\ngop run .\n```\n\nA simplest web program is running now. At this time, if you visit http://localhost:8080, you will get:\n\n```\nHello, YAP!\n```\n\nYAP uses filenames to define routes. `get.yap`'s route is `get \"/\"` (GET homepage), and `get_p_#id.yap`'s route is `get \"/p/:id\"` (In fact, the filename can also be `get_p_:id.yap`, but it is not recommended because `:` is not allowed to exist in filenames under Windows).\n\nLet's create a file named [get_p_#id.yap](https://github.com/goplus/yap/blob/main/demo/classfile2_hello/get_p_%23id.yap) with the following content:\n\n```coffee\njson {\n\t\"id\": ${id},\n}\n```\n\nExecute `gop run .` and visit http://localhost:8080/p/123, you will get:\n\n```\n{\"id\": \"123\"}\n```\n\nSee [yap: Yet Another HTTP Web Framework](https://github.com/goplus/yap) for more details.\n\n\n### spx: A Go+ 2D Game Engine\n\n![Screen Shot1](https://github.com/goplus/spx/blob/main/tutorial/01-Weather/1.jpg) ![Screen Shot2](https://github.com/goplus/spx/blob/main/tutorial/01-Weather/2.jpg)\n\nThrough this example you can learn how to implement dialogues between multiple actors.\n\nHere are some codes in [Kai.spx](https://github.com/goplus/spx/blob/main/tutorial/01-Weather/Kai.spx):\n\n```coffee\nonStart => {\n\tsay \"Where do you come from?\", 2\n\tbroadcast \"1\"\n}\n\nonMsg \"2\", => {\n\tsay \"What's the climate like in your country?\", 3\n\tbroadcast \"3\"\n}\n```\n\nWe call `onStart` and `onMsg` to listen events. `onStart` is called when the program is started. And `onMsg` is called when someone calls `broadcast` to broadcast a message.\n\nWhen the program starts, Kai says `Where do you come from?`, and then broadcasts the message `1`. Who will recieve this message? Let's see codes in [Jaime.spx](https://github.com/goplus/spx/blob/main/tutorial/01-Weather/Jaime.spx):\n\n```coffee\nonMsg \"1\", => {\n\tsay \"I come from England.\", 2\n\tbroadcast \"2\"\n}\n```\n\nYes, Jaime recieves the message `1` and says `I come from England.`. Then he broadcasts the message `2`. Kai recieves it and says `What's the climate like in your country?`.\n\nThe following procedures are very similar. In this way you can implement dialogues between multiple actors.\n\nSee [spx: A Go+ 2D Game Engine](https://github.com/goplus/spx) for more details.\n\n\n### gsh: Go+ DevOps Tools\n\nYes, now you can write `shell script` in Go+. It supports all shell commands.\n\nLet's create a file named [example.gsh](https://github.com/qiniu/x/blob/main/gsh/demo/hello/example.gsh) and write the following code:\n\n```coffee\nmkdir \"testgsh\"\n```\n\nDon't need a `go.mod` file, just enter `gop run ./example.gsh` directly to run.\n\nSee [gsh: Go+ DevOps Tools](https://github.com/qiniu/x/tree/main/gsh) for more details.\n\n\n## How to install\n\nNote: Requires go1.19 or later\n\n### on Windows\n\n```sh\nwinget install goplus.gop\n```\n\n### on Debian/Ubuntu\n\n```sh\nsudo bash -c ' echo \"deb [trusted=yes] https://pkgs.goplus.org/apt/ /\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/goplus.list'\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install gop\n```\n\n### on RedHat/CentOS/Fedora\n\n```sh\nsudo bash -c 'echo -e \"[goplus]\\nname=Go+ Repo\\nbaseurl=https://pkgs.goplus.org/yum/\\nenabled=1\\ngpgcheck=0\" > /etc/yum.repos.d/goplus.repo'\nsudo yum install gop\n```\n\n### on macOS/Linux (Homebrew)\n\nInstall via [brew](https://brew.sh/)\n\n```sh\n$ brew install goplus\n```\n\n### from source code\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/goplus/gop.git\ncd gop\n\n# On mac/linux run:\n./all.bash\n# On Windows run:\nall.bat\n```\n\n## Go+ Applications\n\n### 2D Games powered by Go+\n\n* [A Go+ 2D Game Engine for STEM education](https://github.com/goplus/spx)\n* [Aircraft War](https://github.com/goplus/AircraftWar)\n* [Flappy Bird](https://github.com/goplus/FlappyCalf)\n* [Maze Play](https://github.com/goplus/MazePlay)\n* [BetaGo](https://github.com/xushiwei/BetaGo)\n* [Gobang](https://github.com/xushiwei/Gobang)\n* [Dinosaur](https://github.com/xushiwei/Dinosaur)\n\n### Web Programming\n\n* [yap: Yet Another HTTP Web Framework](https://github.com/goplus/yap)\n* [yaptest: HTTP Test Framework](https://github.com/goplus/yap/tree/main/ytest)\n* [ydb: Database Framework](https://github.com/goplus/yap#ydb-database-framework)\n\n### DevOps Tools\n\n* [gsh: Go+ DevOps Tools](https://github.com/qiniu/x/tree/main/gsh)\n\n### Data Processing\n\n* [hdq: HTML DOM Query Language for Go+](https://github.com/goplus/hdq)\n\n\n## IDE Plugins\n\n* vscode: [Go/Go+ for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goplus.gop)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe Go+ project welcomes all contributors.
