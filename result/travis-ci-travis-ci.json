You can now test and deploy open source and private projects\non [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com)! You can read more about this change \n[here](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-05-02-open-source-projects-on-travis-ci-com-with-github-apps).\n\n## Move to Forum\n\nWe are moving to our new community forum: [Travis CI Community](https://travis-ci.community)! As part of this move, we\u2019ll be able to better follow and reply to threads, along with making it easier for you to find solutions and answers.  We\u2019ll be making our best efforts to answer currently existing threads, or directing them to the new community forum.\n\nLink to the Community Forum: https://travis-ci.community\n\nFor current outages and incidents such as slow network connections, subscribe to https://www.traviscistatus.com.\n\nOther support issues may be directed to support@travis-ci.com where our support team will be glad to assist.\n\nThis repository contains the [central issue\ntracker](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues) for the Travis CI\nproject.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for the Travis CI project can be found at\n<https://docs.travis-ci.com>.\n\n## Other repositories\n\nTravis CI consists of many different sub-projects. The main ones are:\n\n### travis-api\n\n[travis-api](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-api) is the Sinatra app that's\nresponsible for serving our API. It responds to different HTTP endpoints and\nruns services in [travis-core](#travis-core). Very little logic is in this\nrepository.\n\n### travis-build\n\n[travis-build](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build) creates the build\nscript for each job. It takes the configuration from the `.travis.yml` file and\ncreates a `bash` script that is then run in the build environment by\n[travis-worker](#travis-worker). This repository also hosts the source for\n[language-specific scripts](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/tree/master/lib/travis/build/script).\n\n### travis-cookbooks\n\n[travis-cookbooks](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-cookbooks) holds the\n[Chef](https://docs.chef.io/index.html) cookbooks that are used to provision the build environments.\n\n### travis-hub\n\n[travis-hub](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-hub) collects events from\nother apps and notifies other apps about the events. For example, it notifies\n[travis-tasks](#travis-tasks) about builds starting and finishing so\nnotifications can be sent out.\n\ntravis-hub is also responsible for enqueueing jobs that have been created and\nenforcing the Quality of Service restrictions, such as the number of concurrent\nbuilds per user.\n\n### travis-listener\n\n[travis-listener](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-listener) receives\nnotifications from GitHub whenever commits are pushed or pull requests are\nopened. They are then pushed onto RabbitMQ for other apps to process.\n\n### travis-logs\n\n[travis-logs](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-logs) receives log updates\nfrom [travis-worker](#travis-worker), saves them to the database and pushes\nthem to the [web client](#travis-web). When a job is finished, travis-logs is\nresponsible for pushing the log to Amazon S3 for archiving.\n\n### travis-support\n\n[travis-support](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-support) holds shared\nlogic for the different Travis CI apps. It is different from travis-core in\nthat it holds more generic things, like how to run an async job or how to\nhandle exceptions.\n\n### travis-tasks\n\n[travis-tasks](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-tasks) receives\nnotifications from [travis-hub](#travis-hub) and sends out notifications to the\ndifferent notification providers as needed.\n\n### travis-web\n\n[travis-web](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web) is our main Web client.\nIt is written using [Ember](http://emberjs.com) and communicates with\n[travis-api](#travis-api) to get information and gets live updates from\n[travis-hub](#travis-hub) and [travis-logs](#travis-logs) through\n[Pusher](https://pusher.com/).\n\n### travis-worker\n\n[travis-worker](https://github.com/travis-ci/worker) is responsible for\nrunning the build scripts in a clean environment. It streams the log output to\n[travis-logs](#travis-logs) and pushes state updates (build starting/finishing)\nto [travis-hub](#travis-hub).\n",
