Natural Language Processing (NLP) and give an overview\nof the state-of-the-art (SOTA) across the most common NLP tasks and their corresponding datasets.\n\nIt aims to cover both traditional and core NLP tasks such as dependency parsing and part-of-speech tagging\nas well as more recent ones such as reading comprehension and natural language inference. The main objective\nis to provide the reader with a quick overview of benchmark datasets and the state-of-the-art for their\ntask of interest, which serves as a stepping stone for further research. To this end, if there is a \nplace where results for a task are already published and regularly maintained, such as a public leaderboard,\nthe reader will be pointed there.\n\nIf you want to find this document again in the future, just go to [`nlpprogress.com`](https://nlpprogress.com/)\nor [`nlpsota.com`](http://nlpsota.com/) in your browser.\n\n### Contributing\n\n#### Guidelines\n\n**Results** &nbsp; Results reported in published papers are preferred; an exception may be made for influential preprints.\n\n**Datasets** &nbsp; Datasets should have been used for evaluation in at least one published paper besides \nthe one that introduced the dataset.\n\n**Code** &nbsp; We recommend to add a link to an implementation \nif available. You can add a `Code` column (see below) to the table if it does not exist.\nIn the `Code` column, indicate an official implementation with [Official](http://link_to_implementation).\nIf an unofficial implementation is available, use [Link](http://link_to_implementation) (see below).\nIf no implementation is available, you can leave the cell empty.\n\n#### Adding a new result\n\nIf you would like to add a new result, you can just click on the small edit button in the top-right\ncorner of the file for the respective task (see below).\n\n![Click on the edit button to add a file](img/edit_file.png)\n\nThis allows you to edit the file in Markdown. Simply add a row to the corresponding table in the\nsame format. Make sure that the table stays sorted (with the best result on top). \nAfter you've made your change, make sure that the table still looks ok by clicking on the\n\"Preview changes\" tab at the top of the page. If everything looks good, go to the bottom of the page,\nwhere you see the below form. \n\n![Fill out the file change information](img/propose_file_change.png)\n\nAdd a name for your proposed change, an optional description, indicate that you would like to\n\"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request\", and click on \"Propose file change\".\n\n#### Adding a new dataset or task\n\nFor adding a new dataset or task, you can also follow the steps above. Alternatively, you can fork the repository.\nIn both cases, follow the steps below:\n\n1. If your task is completely new, create a new file and link to it in the table of contents above.\n2. If not, add your task or dataset to the respective section of the corresponding file (in alphabetical order).\n3. Briefly describe the dataset/task and include relevant references. \n4. Describe the evaluation setting and evaluation metric.\n5. Show how an annotated example of the dataset/task looks like.\n6. Add a download link if available.\n7. Copy the below table and fill in at least two results (including the state-of-the-art)\n  for your dataset/task (change Score to the metric of your dataset). If your dataset/task\n  has multiple metrics, add them to the right of `Score`.\n1. Submit your change as a pull request.\n  \n| Model           | Score  |  Paper / Source | Code |\n| ------------- | :-----:| --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | |\n\n\n### Wish list\n\nThese are tasks and datasets that are still missing:\n\n- Bilingual dictionary induction\n- Discourse parsing\n- Keyphrase extraction\n- Knowledge base population (KBP)\n- More dialogue tasks\n- Semi-supervised learning\n- Frame-semantic parsing (FrameNet full-sentence analysis)\n\n### Exporting into a structured format\n\nYou can extract all the data into a structured, machine-readable JSON format with parsed tasks, descriptions and SOTA tables. \n\nThe instructions are in [structured/README.md](structured/README.md).\n\n### Instructions for building the site locally\n\nInstructions for building the website locally using Jekyll can be found [here](jekyll_instructions.md).\n\n\n",
