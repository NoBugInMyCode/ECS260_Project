Feel free to go through the book [Start here](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/SUMMARY.md)\n\n**Questions/Suggestions**: Feel free about any questions or suggestions by pinging me at twitter [@0xAX](https://twitter.com/0xAX), adding an [issue](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/new) or just drop me an [email](mailto:anotherworldofworld@gmail.com).\n\nGenerating eBooks and PDFs - [documentation](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/ebook.md)\n\n# Mailing List\n\nWe have a Google Group mailing list for learning the kernel source code. Here are some instructions about how to use it.\n\n#### Join\n\nSend an email with any subject/content to `kernelhacking+subscribe@googlegroups.com`. Then you will receive a confirmation email. Reply it with any content and then you are done.\n\n> If you have Google account, you can also open the [archive page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kernelhacking) and click **Apply to join group**. You will be approved automatically.\n\n#### Send emails to mailing list\n\nJust send emails to `kernelhacking@googlegroups.com`. The basic usage is the same as other mailing lists powered by mailman.\n\n#### Archives\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kernelhacking\n\nOn other languages\n-------------------\n\n  * [Brazilian Portuguese](https://github.com/mauri870/linux-insides)\n  * [Chinese](https://github.com/MintCN/linux-insides-zh)\n  * [Japanese](https://github.com/tkmru/linux-insides-ja)\n  * [Korean](https://github.com/junsooo/linux-insides-ko)\n  * [Russian](https://github.com/proninyaroslav/linux-insides-ru)\n  * [Spanish](https://github.com/leolas95/linux-insides)\n  * [Turkish](https://github.com/ayyucedemirbas/linux-insides_Turkish)\n\nDocker\n------\n\nIn order to run your own copy of the book with gitbook within a local container:\n\n1. Enable Docker experimental features with vim or another text editor\n   ```bash\n    sudo vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service\n   ```\n\n   Then add --experimental=true to the end of the ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// line and save.\n\n   Eg: *ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --experimental=true*\n\n   Then, you need to reload and restart the Docker daemon:\n   ```bash\n    systemctl daemon-reload\n    systemctl restart docker.service\n   ```\n\n2. Run docker image\n   ```bash\n   make run\n   ```\n\n3. Open your local copy of linux insides book under this url\n   http://localhost:4000 or run `make browse`\n\n\nContributions \n--------------\n\nFeel free to create issues or pull-requests if you have any problems.\n\n**Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before pushing any changes.**\n\n![linux-kernel](Assets/linux-kernel.png)\n\nAuthor\n---------------\n\n[@0xAX](https://twitter.com/0xAX)\n\nLICENSE\n-------------\n\nLicensed [BY-NC-SA Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\n",
