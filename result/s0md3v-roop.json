It just won't recieve any updates now.\n\n> I do not have the interest or time to oversee the development of this software. I thank all the amazing people who contributed to this project and made what it is in it's final form.\n\n# Roop\n\n> Take a video and replace the face in it with a face of your choice. You only need one image of the desired face. No dataset, no training.\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/s0md3v/roop/ci.yml.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/actions?query=workflow:ci)\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4RdPYwQ/Untitled.jpg\"/>\n\n## Installation\n\nBe aware, the installation needs technical skills and is not for beginners. Please do not open platform and installation related issues on GitHub.\n\n[Basic](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/1.-Installation) - It is more likely to work on your computer, but will be quite slow\n\n[Acceleration](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/2.-Acceleration) - Unleash the full potential of your CPU and GPU\n\n\n## Usage\n\nStart the program with arguments:\n\n```\npython run.py [options]\n\n-h, --help                                                                 show this help message and exit\n-s SOURCE_PATH, --source SOURCE_PATH                                       select an source image\n-t TARGET_PATH, --target TARGET_PATH                                       select an target image or video\n-o OUTPUT_PATH, --output OUTPUT_PATH                                       select output file or directory\n--frame-processor FRAME_PROCESSOR [FRAME_PROCESSOR ...]                    frame processors (choices: face_swapper, face_enhancer, ...)\n--keep-fps                                                                 keep target fps\n--keep-frames                                                              keep temporary frames\n--skip-audio                                                               skip target audio\n--many-faces                                                               process every face\n--reference-face-position REFERENCE_FACE_POSITION                          position of the reference face\n--reference-frame-number REFERENCE_FRAME_NUMBER                            number of the reference frame\n--similar-face-distance SIMILAR_FACE_DISTANCE                              face distance used for recognition\n--temp-frame-format {jpg,png}                                              image format used for frame extraction\n--temp-frame-quality [0-100]                                               image quality used for frame extraction\n--output-video-encoder {libx264,libx265,libvpx-vp9,h264_nvenc,hevc_nvenc}  encoder used for the output video\n--output-video-quality [0-100]                                             quality used for the output video\n--max-memory MAX_MEMORY                                                    maximum amount of RAM in GB\n--execution-provider {cpu} [{cpu} ...]                                     available execution provider (choices: cpu, ...)\n--execution-threads EXECUTION_THREADS                                      number of execution threads\n-v, --version                                                              show program's version number and exit\n```\n\n\n### Headless\n\nUsing the `-s/--source`, `-t/--target` and `-o/--output` argument will run the program in headless mode.\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis software is designed to contribute positively to the AI-generated media industry, assisting artists with tasks like character animation and models for clothing.\n\nWe are aware of the potential ethical issues and have implemented measures to prevent the software from being used for inappropriate content, such as nudity.\n\nUsers are expected to follow local laws and use the software responsibly.
