Games can\nbe exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop\nplatforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as\nWeb-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).\n\n## Free, open source and community-driven\n\nGodot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).\nNo strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down\nto the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and\ncommunity-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their\nexpectations. It is supported by the [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/)\nnot-for-profit.\n\nBefore being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),\nGodot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and\n[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)\nfor several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire\ntitles.\n\n![Screenshot of a 3D scene in the Godot Engine editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-design/master/screenshots/editor_tps_demo_1920x1080.jpg)\n\n## Getting the engine\n\n### Binary downloads\n\nOfficial binaries for the Godot editor and the export templates can be found\n[on the Godot website](https://godotengine.org/download).\n\n### Compiling from source\n\n[See the official docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling)\nfor compilation instructions for every supported platform.\n\n## Community and contributing\n\nGodot is not only an engine but an ever-growing community of users and engine\ndevelopers. The main community channels are listed [on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/community).\n\nThe best way to get in touch with the core engine developers is to join the\n[Godot Contributors Chat](https://chat.godotengine.org).\n\nTo get started contributing to the project, see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\nThis document also includes guidelines for reporting bugs.\n\n## Documentation and demos\n\nThe official documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org).\nIt is maintained by the Godot community in its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs).\n\nThe [class reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/)\nis also accessible from the Godot editor.\n\nWe also maintain official demos in their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects)\nas well as a list of [awesome Godot community resources](https://github.com/godotengine/awesome-godot).\n\nThere are also a number of other\n[learning resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/tutorials.html)\nprovided by the community, such as text and video tutorials, demos, etc.\nConsult the [community channels](https://godotengine.org/community)\nfor more information.\n\n[![Code Triagers Badge](https://www.codetriage.com/godotengine/godot/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/godotengine/godot)\n[![Translate on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/godot-engine/-/godot/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/godot-engine/?utm_source=widget)\n[![TODOs](https://badgen.net/https/api.tickgit.com/badgen/github.com/godotengine/godot)](https://www.tickgit.com/browse?repo=github.com/godotengine/godot)\n",
