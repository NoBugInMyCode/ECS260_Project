AFAIK, *croc* is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does **all** of the following:\n\n- allows **any two computers** to transfer data (using a relay)\n- provides **end-to-end encryption** (using PAKE)\n- enables easy **cross-platform** transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)\n- allows **multiple file** transfers\n- allows **resuming transfers** that are interrupted\n- local server or port-forwarding **not needed**\n- **ipv6-first** with ipv4 fallback\n- can **use proxy**, like tor\n\nFor more information about `croc`, see [my blog post](https://schollz.com/software/croc6) or read a [recent interview I did](https://console.substack.com/p/console-91).\n\n![Example](src/install/customization.gif)\n\n## Install\n\nDownload [the latest release for your system](https://github.com/schollz/croc/releases/latest), or install a release from the command-line:\n\n```\ncurl https://getcroc.schollz.com | bash\n```\n\n\nOn macOS you can install the latest release with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): \n\n```\nbrew install croc\n```\n\nOn macOS you can also install the latest release with [MacPorts](https://macports.org/): \n\n```\nsudo port selfupdate\nsudo port install croc\n```\n\nOn Windows you can install the latest release with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org), or [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/): \n\n```bash\nscoop install croc\n```\n\n```bash\nchoco install croc\n```\n\n```bash\nwinget install schollz.croc\n```\n\nOn Unix you can install the latest release with [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix):\n\n```bash\nnix-env -i croc\n```\n\n\nOn Alpine Linux you have to install dependencies first:\n\n```bash\napk add bash coreutils\nwget -qO- https://getcroc.schollz.com | bash\n```\n\nOn Arch Linux you can install the latest release with `pacman`:\n\n```bash\npacman -S croc\n```\n\nOn Fedora you can install with `dnf`:\n\n```bash\ndnf install croc\n```\n\nOn Gentoo you can install with `portage`:\n\n```bash\nemerge net-misc/croc\n```\n\nOn Termux you can install with `pkg`:\n\n```bash\npkg install croc\n```\n\nOn FreeBSD you can install with `pkg`:\n\n```bash\npkg install croc\n```\n\nOn Linux, macOS, and Windows you can install from [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/croc-feedstock/) globally with [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/):\n\n```bash\npixi global install croc\n```\n\nor into a particular environment with [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/):\n\n```bash\nconda install --channel conda-forge croc\n```\n\nOr, you can [install Go](https://golang.org/dl/) and build from source (requires Go 1.17+):\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/schollz/croc/v10@latest\n```\n\nOn Android there is a 3rd party F-Droid app [available to download](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.howeyc.crocgui/).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo send a file, simply do: \n\n```bash\n$ croc send [file(s)-or-folder]\nSending 'file-or-folder' (X MB)\nCode is: code-phrase\n```\n\nThen to receive the file (or folder) on another computer, you can just do \n\n```\ncroc code-phrase\n```\n\nThe code phrase is used to establish password-authenticated key agreement ([PAKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement)) which generates a secret key for the sender and recipient to use for end-to-end encryption.\n\nThere are a number of configurable options (see `--help`). A set of options (like custom relay, ports, and code phrase) can be set using `--remember`.\n\n### Using `croc` on Linux or Mac OS\n\nOn Linux and Mac OS, the sending & receiving is slightly different to avoid [leaking the secret via the process name](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43621). On these systems you will need to run `croc` with the secret as an environment variable. For example, to receive with the secret `***`:\n\n```bash\nCROC_SECRET=*** croc\n```\n\nThis will show only `croc` in the process list of a multi-user system and not leak the secret.\n\nFor a single-user system the default behavior can be permanently enabled by running\n\n```bash\ncroc --classic\n```\n\nand confirming. \nRun this command again to disable classic mode.\n\n### Custom code phrase\n\nYou can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 6 characters).\n\n```bash\ncroc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder]\n```\n\n### Allow overwriting without prompt\n\nBy default, croc will prompt whether to overwrite a file. You can automatically overwrite files by using the `--overwrite` flag (recipient only). For example, receive a file to automatically overwrite:\n\n```bash\ncroc --yes --overwrite <code>\n```\n\n### Excluding folders\n\nYou can exclude folders from being sent by using the `--exclude` flag with a string of comma-delimited exclusions. For example, if you want to send a folder but exclude any `node_modules` folders or `.venv` folders:\n\n```bash\ncroc send --exclude \"node_modules,.venv\" [folder]\n```\n\nExclusions work by excluding any absolute path that contains the string. So in the above example, any folder named `node_modules` or `.venv` will be excluded from the transfer.\n\n### Use pipes - stdin and stdout\n\nYou can pipe to `croc`:\n\n```bash\ncat [filename] | croc send\n```\n\nIn this case `croc` will automatically use the stdin data and send and assign a filename like \"croc-stdin-123456789\". To receive to `stdout` at you can always just use the `--yes`  will automatically approve the transfer and pipe it out to `stdout`. \n\n```bash\ncroc --yes [code-phrase] > out\n```\n\nAll of the other text printed to the console is going to `stderr` so it will not interfere with the message going to `stdout`.\n\n\n### Send text\n\nSometimes you want to send URLs or short text. In addition to piping, you can easily send text with `croc`:\n\n```bash\ncroc send --text \"hello world\"\n```\n\nThis will automatically tell the receiver to use `stdout` when they receive the text so it will be displayed.\n\n\n### Use a proxy\n\nYou can use a proxy as your connection to the relay by adding a proxy address with `--socks5`. For example, you can send via a tor relay:\n\n```bash\ncroc --socks5 \"127.0.0.1:9050\" send SOMEFILE\n```\n\n### Change encryption curve\n\nYou can choose from several different elliptic curves to use for encryption by using the `--curve` flag. Only the recipient can choose the curve. For example, receive a file using the P-521 curve:\n\n```bash\ncroc --curve p521 <codephrase>\n```\n\nAvailable curves are P-256, P-348, P-521 and SIEC. P-256 is the default curve.\n\n### Change hash algorithm\n\nYou can choose from several different hash algorithms. The default is the `xxhash` algorithm which is fast and thorough. If you want to optimize for speed you can use the `imohash` algorithm which is even faster, but since it samples files (versus reading the whole file) it can mistakenly determine that a file is the same on the two computers transferring - though this is only a problem if you are syncing files versus sending a new file to a computer.\n\n```bash\ncroc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE\n```\n\n### Self-host relay\n\nThe relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections. By default, `croc` uses a public relay but you can also run your own relay:\n\n```bash\ncroc relay\n```\n\nBy default it uses TCP ports 9009-9013. Make sure to open those up. You can customize the ports (e.g. `croc relay --ports 1111,1112`), but you must have a minimum of **2** ports for the relay. The first port is for communication and the subsequent ports are used for the multiplexed data transfer.\n\nYou can send files using your relay by entering `--relay` to change the relay that you are using if you want to custom host your own.\n\n```bash\ncroc --relay \"myrelay.example.com:9009\" send [filename]\n```\n\nNote, when sending, you only need to include the first port (the communication port). The subsequent ports for data transfer will be transmitted back to the user from the relay.\n\n#### Self-host relay (docker)\n\nIf it's easier you can also run a relay with Docker:\n\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc\n```\n\nBe sure to include the password for the relay otherwise any requests will be rejected. \n\n```bash\ncroc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay \"myreal.example.com:9009\" send [filename]\n```\n\nNote: when including `--pass YOURPASSWORD` you can instead pass a file with the password, e.g. `--pass FILEWITHPASSWORD`.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n`croc` has gone through many iterations, and I am awed by all the great contributions!
