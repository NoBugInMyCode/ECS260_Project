More added as courses progress.\n\n## Tutorial: Deep Learning Basics\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_deep_learning_basics/deep_learning_basics.ipynb\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/j4FqBuR.gif\"></a>\n\nThis tutorial accompanies the [lecture on Deep Learning Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf&v=O5xeyoRL95U). It presents several concepts in deep learning, demonstrating the first two (feed forward and convolutional neural networks) and providing pointers to tutorials on the others. This is a good place to start.\n\nLinks: \\[ [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_deep_learning_basics/deep_learning_basics.ipynb) \\]\n\\[ [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_deep_learning_basics/deep_learning_basics.ipynb) \\]\n\\[ [Blog Post](https://medium.com/tensorflow/mit-deep-learning-basics-introduction-and-overview-with-tensorflow-355bcd26baf0) \\]\n\\[ [Lecture Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf&v=O5xeyoRL95U) \\]\n\n\n## Tutorial: Driving Scene Segmentation\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_driving_scene_segmentation/tutorial_driving_scene_segmentation.ipynb\"><img src=\"images/thumb_driving_scene_segmentation.gif\"></a>\n\nThis tutorial demostrates semantic segmentation with a state-of-the-art model (DeepLab) on a sample video from the MIT Driving Scene Segmentation Dataset.\n\nLinks: \\[ [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_driving_scene_segmentation/tutorial_driving_scene_segmentation.ipynb) \\]\n\\[ [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_driving_scene_segmentation/tutorial_driving_scene_segmentation.ipynb) \\]\n\n## Tutorial: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_gans/tutorial_gans.ipynb\"><img src=\"images/thumb_mushroom_biggan.gif\"></a>\n\nThis tutorial explores generative adversarial networks (GANs) starting with BigGAN, the state-of-the-art conditional GAN.\n\nLinks: \\[ [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_gans/tutorial_gans.ipynb) \\]\n\\[ [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_gans/tutorial_gans.ipynb) \\]\n\n## DeepTraffic Deep Reinforcement Learning Competition\n\n<a href=\"https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic\"><img src=\"images/thumb_deeptraffic.gif\"></a>\n\nDeepTraffic is a deep reinforcement learning competition. The goal is to create a neural network that drives a vehicle (or multiple vehicles) as fast as possible through dense highway traffic.\n\nLinks: \\[ [GitHub](https://github.com/lexfridman/deeptraffic) \\] \\[ [Website](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic) \\] \\[ [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02805) \\]\n\n## Team\n\n- [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com)\n- [Li Ding](https://www.mit.edu/~liding/)\n- [Jack Terwilliger](https://www.mit.edu/~jterwill/)\n- [Michael Glazer](https://www.mit.edu/~glazermi/)\n- [Aleksandr Patsekin](https://www.mit.edu/~patsekin/)\n- [Aishni Parab](https://www.mit.edu/~aishni/)\n- [Dina AlAdawy](https://www.mit.edu/~aladawy/)\n- [Henri Schmidt](https://www.mit.edu/~henris/)\n",
