The libpod library provides APIs for managing containers, pods, container images, and volumes.\n\nPodman releases a new major or minor release 4 times a year, during the second week of February, May, August, and November. Patch releases are more frequent and may occur at any time to get bugfixes out to users. All releases are PGP signed. Public keys of members of the team approved to make releases are located [here](https://github.com/containers/release-keys/tree/main/podman).\n\n* Continuous Integration:\n  * [![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/containers/podman.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/containers/podman/main)\n  * [GoDoc: ![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/containers/podman/libpod?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/containers/podman/libpod)\n  * [Downloads](DOWNLOADS.md)\n\n## Overview and scope\n\nAt a high level, the scope of Podman and libpod is the following:\n\n* Support for multiple container image formats, including OCI and Docker images.\n* Full management of those images, including pulling from various sources (including trust and verification), creating (built via Containerfile or Dockerfile or committed from a container), and pushing to registries and other storage backends.\n* Full management of container lifecycle, including creation (both from an image and from an exploded root filesystem), running, checkpointing and restoring (via CRIU), and removal.\n* Full management of container networking, using Netavark.\n* Support for pods, groups of containers that share resources and are managed together.\n* Support for running containers and pods without root or other elevated privileges.\n* Resource isolation of containers and pods.\n* Support for a Docker-compatible CLI interface, which can both run containers locally and on remote systems.\n* No manager daemon, for improved security and lower resource utilization at idle.\n* Support for a REST API providing both a Docker-compatible interface and an improved interface exposing advanced Podman functionality.\n* Support for running on Windows and Mac via virtual machines run by `podman machine`.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe future of Podman feature development can be found in its **[roadmap](ROADMAP.md)**.\n\n## Communications\n\nIf you think you've identified a security issue in the project, please *DO NOT* report the issue publicly via the GitHub issue tracker, mailing list, or IRC.\nInstead, send an email with as many details as possible to `security@lists.podman.io`. This is a private mailing list for the core maintainers.\n\nFor general questions and discussion, please use Podman's\n[channels](https://podman.io/community/#slack-irc-matrix-and-discord).\n\nFor discussions around issues/bugs and features, you can use the GitHub\n[issues](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues)\nand\n[PRs](https://github.com/containers/podman/pulls)\ntracking system.\n\nThere is also a [mailing list](https://lists.podman.io/archives/) at `lists.podman.io`.\nYou can subscribe by sending a message to `podman-join@lists.podman.io` with the subject `subscribe`.\n\n## Rootless\nPodman can be easily run as a normal user, without requiring a setuid binary.\nWhen run without root, Podman containers use user namespaces to set root in the container to the user running Podman.\nRootless Podman runs locked-down containers with no privileges that the user running the container does not have.\nSome of these restrictions can be lifted (via `--privileged`, for example), but rootless containers will never have more privileges than the user that launched them.\nIf you run Podman as your user and mount in `/etc/passwd` from the host, you still won't be able to change it, since your user doesn't have permission to do so.\n\nAlmost all normal Podman functionality is available, though there are some [shortcomings](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/rootless.md).\nAny recent Podman release should be able to run rootless without any additional configuration, though your operating system may require some additional configuration detailed in the [install guide](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).\n\nA little configuration by an administrator is required before rootless Podman can be used, the necessary setup is documented [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md).\n\n## Podman Desktop\n\n[Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) provides a local development environment for Podman and Kubernetes on Linux, Windows, and Mac machines.\nIt is a full-featured desktop UI frontend for Podman which uses the `podman machine` backend on non-Linux operating systems to run containers.\nIt supports full container lifecycle management (building, pulling, and pushing images, creating and managing containers, creating and managing pods, and working with Kubernetes YAML).\nThe project develops on [GitHub](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop) and contributions are welcome.\n\n## Out of scope\n\n* Specialized signing and pushing of images to various storage backends.\n  See [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/) for those tasks.\n* Support for the Kubernetes CRI interface for container management.\n  The [CRI-O](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o) daemon specializes in that.\n\n## OCI Projects Plans\n\nPodman uses OCI projects and best of breed libraries for different aspects:\n- Runtime: We use the [OCI runtime tools](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools) to generate OCI runtime configurations that can be used with any OCI-compliant runtime, like [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun/) and [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/).\n- Images: Image management uses the [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image) library.\n- Storage: Container and image storage is managed by [containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage).\n- Networking: Networking support through use of [Netavark](https://github.com/containers/netavark) and [Aardvark](https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns).  Rootless networking is handled via [pasta](https://passt.top/passt) or [slirp4netns](https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns).\n- Builds: Builds are supported via [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah).\n- Conmon: [Conmon](https://github.com/containers/conmon) is a tool for monitoring OCI runtimes, used by both Podman and CRI-O.\n- Seccomp: A unified [Seccomp](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/pkg/seccomp/seccomp.json) policy for Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O.\n\n## Podman Information for Developers\n\nFor blogs, release announcements and more, please checkout the [podman.io](https://podman.io) website!\n\n**[Installation notes](install.md)**\nInformation on how to install Podman in your environment.\n\n**[OCI Hooks Support](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/pkg/hooks/README.md)**\nInformation on how Podman configures [OCI Hooks][spec-hooks] to run when launching a container.\n\n**[Podman API](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/_static/api.html)**\nDocumentation on the Podman REST API.\n\n**[Podman Commands](https://podman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Commands.html)**\nA list of the Podman commands with links to their man pages and in many cases videos\nshowing the commands in use.\n\n**[Podman Container Images](https://github.com/containers/image_build/blob/main/podman/README.md)**\nInformation on the Podman Container Images found on [quay.io](https://quay.io/podman/stable).\n\n**[Podman Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)**\nA list of common issues and solutions for Podman.\n\n**[Podman Usage Transfer](transfer.md)**\nUseful information for ops and dev transfer as it relates to infrastructure that utilizes Podman.

Both, Buildah and Podman are\ncommand line tools that work on Open Container Initiative (OCI) images and\ncontainers.  The two projects differentiate in their specialization.\n\nBuildah specializes in building OCI images.  Buildah's commands replicate all\nof the commands that are found in a Dockerfile.  This allows building images\nwith and without Dockerfiles while not requiring any root privileges.\nBuildah\u2019s ultimate goal is to provide a lower-level coreutils interface to\nbuild images.  The flexibility of building images without Dockerfiles allows\nfor the integration of other scripting languages into the build process.\nBuildah follows a simple fork-exec model and does not run as a daemon\nbut it is based on a comprehensive API in golang, which can be vendored\ninto other tools.\n\nPodman specializes in all of the commands and functions that help you to maintain and modify\nOCI images, such as pulling and tagging.  It also allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers\ncreated from those images.  For building container images via Dockerfiles, Podman uses Buildah's\ngolang API and can be installed independently from Buildah.\n\nA major difference between Podman and Buildah is their concept of a container.  Podman\nallows users to create \"traditional containers\" where the intent of these containers is\nto be long lived.  While Buildah containers are really just created to allow content\nto be added back to the container image.  An easy way to think of it is the\n`buildah run` command emulates the RUN command in a Dockerfile while the `podman run`\ncommand emulates the `docker run` command in functionality.  Because of this and their underlying\nstorage differences, you can not see Podman containers from within Buildah or vice versa.\n\nIn short, Buildah is an efficient way to create OCI images while Podman allows\nyou to manage and maintain those images and containers in a production environment using\nfamiliar container cli commands.  For more details, see the\n[Container Tools Guide](https://github.com/containers/buildah/tree/main/docs/containertools).\n\n## Podman Hello\n```\n$ podman run quay.io/podman/hello\nTrying to pull quay.io/podman/hello:latest...\nGetting image source signatures\nCopying blob a6b3126f3807 done\nCopying config 25c667d086 done\nWriting manifest to image destination\nStoring signatures\n!...
