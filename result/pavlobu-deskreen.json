The difference is that it is rewritten\nin `Typescript` and transformed to use `node-forge` instead of `window.crypto.subtle`.\nWhy this was made? Because a client served with `http` without SSL, which makes `window.crypto.subtle` unavailable.\n\n<br/>\n\n## [Deskreen FAQ](https://deskreen.com/?#faq)\n\n<br/>\n\n## Get Started for translators\n\nWant to add a new language support for Deskreen?\nOr you found a typo in existing translations of Deskreen App or website?\nHere are step by step guides:\n\n- [How to add a new language to Deskreen App and Website](doc/translations-docs/how-to-add-new-language-translation-to-Deskreen.md)\n- [How to fix a typo in Deskreen App or Website](doc/translations-docs/fix-a-typo-in-existing-translation-of-Deskreen.md)\n\n<br/>\n\n## Deskreen Github Discussion Threads\n\n[Read and Respect our Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct When Writing in our Discussion Threads.](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n### [Announcements Channel in Discussions](https://github.com/pavlobu/deskreen/discussions/71)\n\nSome progress and updates on Deskreen can be found [here](https://github.com/pavlobu/deskreen/discussions/71).\n\n---\n\n- [Q&A General](https://github.com/pavlobu/deskreen/discussions/89) - for general questions about Deskreen.\n\n---\n\n- [Bugs General](https://github.com/pavlobu/deskreen/discussions/68) - for general bug reports if you don't know dev environment details.

Share your knowledge or useful links on how to get built in system audio output and put it to WebRTC stream so that client viewing device will be able to play it along with the video stream.\n\n---\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## NOTE: We are looking for a solution to get rid from Dummy Display Plugs while using Deskreen as a second screen. Your code support is highly valuable and welcome in Deskreen!\n\nDisplay Dummy Plugs are good temporary solution, but it is not that good for everyone.\nIf you are a seasoned Windows or Linux or MacOS hacker with a knowledge of low level tweaks and tricks, you can help us to make Deskreen better!\nOn a long run Deskreen seeks for getting rid of Display Dummy Plugs, because most people don't like using them. Sometimes they can't use them because all available display ports are already taken.\n**So we need to have native drivers for Win / Mac / Linux that will help to enable virtual display without Dummy Display Plugs.**\nThere are already working commercial solutions out there with their own drivers which they don't disclose, but this task is doable with a help of entire community.\nThe goal of Deskreen is to enable community power and knowledge to overcome these technical challenges and make it a go-to second screen solution that everyone will benefit from!\n\nWe plan on making virtual display driver support for each of three main operating systems and place all OS related codes in **[`./drivers`](drivers)** subdirectory of this project.\nYou can find brief requirements for driver API in **[`./drivers/README.md`](drivers)**.\n\nShare your valuable knowledge on how to create virtual desktop **without a Dummy Display Plug [in this discussion thread.](https://github.com/pavlobu/deskreen/discussions/86)**\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n## Installing with binaries\n\n### Windows\n\n- Get the .msi or .exe file from Releases\n\n### Mac\n\n- Get the .dmg file from Releases\n\n- Or get from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install --cask deskreen`\n\n### Linux\n\n- Debian and Ubuntu based distributions (deb)\n\n- Enterprise Linux based distributions (rpm)\n\n- Arch Linux [AUR Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/deskreen/)\n\n- AppImage for other distributions\n\n## Get Started for Developers\n\n### Run `yarn test-all` locally to make sure you don't have any errors, before submitting your PR\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nYou will need to have `node` `npm` and `yarn` installed\nglobally on your machine.\n\n1. git clone this repo\n2. `cd app/client; yarn install --frozen-lockfile ; cd ../../ ; yarn install --frozen-lockfile`\n3. `yarn dev` -- run in dev mode with live updates\n\n### Useful yarn commands\n\n`yarn start` -- run in production mode to test, without packaging\n`yarn package` -- to package an app and make executables available in `release` folder\n\n#### for more yarn commands look at `package.json`\n\n### How to run tests\n\n`yarn test` -- run all unit tests\n`yarn build-ux && yarn test-ux` -- run User Experience tests (no tests for `app/client` yet)\n\n### TODO: add e2e tests with host + client app interaction\n\n#### run tests of host app\n\n`yarn test-watch-not-silent` -- run tests in watch mode with console logs only for host app, excluding `app/client`\n`yarn test -- -u` -- update snapshots\n\n#### run tests for `app/client`\n\n`yarn test` -- run client tests in watch mode\n`test:nowatch` -- run client tests a single time\n`yarn test -- -u` -- update snapshots\n\n### Generate test coverage results\n\n`yarn coverage` -- when run from project root, generates a coverage report for `host` and `app/client`\n\n### How to regenerate snapshots if you have tests failing when running `yarn test`?\n\nin root `./` folder of project run this:\n\n```\nyarn jest --updateSnapshot\n```\n\nin Deskreen Viewer `./app/client` folder of project run this:\n\n```\ncd app/client\nSKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true yarn test:nowatch -- -u\n```\n\n### Run `yarn test-all` locally to make sure you don't have any errors, before submitting your PR\n\n## Instruction for running a local Sonar Qube, community edition\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nYou need to install Sonar Qube community edition for your machine.\nAnd sonar-scanner. Then add sonar scanner to your PATH.\n\nYou need to run sonar-scanner separately on root directory\nand on `app/client` directory.\n\nLuckily for you sonar scanner is automatically triggered after `husky` checks.\nSo you only need to install and configure SonarCube locally and\ncreate two separate projects in SonarCube panel.\nFirst project for host app, and second project for client viewer app.\nTODO: add how to get started with local SonarCube for Deskreen in details.\n\n## Documentation\n\n### High level architecture design\n\n![high-level-design](./doc/architecture/deskreen-arch-pavlobu-21012021.svg)\n\n### WebRTC Screen Sharing Session Initiation Step by Step\n\n![sharng-session-init](./doc/init-sharing-session/deskreen-webrtc-screen-sharing-session-initiation-pavlobu-22012021.svg)\n\n### Benchmarks:\n\n[Benchmarks can be found here](./doc/benchmarks)\n\n## Note on versioning:\n\n- All versions git tags should start with `v` ex. `v1.0.0`\n- Before making a new release with `git push <version-tagname>` set version\n  to `<version-tagname>` ! without `v` in the beginning! (ex. `1.0.0` -- not start with `v`) in these three files:\n  - `package.json` -- in `version` key ex. `1.0.0`\n  - `app/package.json` -- in `version` key ex. `1.0.0`\n  - `app/package-lock.json` -- in `version` key ex. `1.0.0`\n  - `app/client/package.json` -- in `version` key ex. `1.0.0`\n\n## Found typo on https://deskreen.com ?\n\nYou can submit your pull request with fix on [Deskreen website locales repo](https://github.com/Deskreen/deskreen-website-locales)\n\n## Maintainer\n\n- [Pavlo (Paul) Buidenkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavlobu)\n\n## License\n\nAGPL-3.0 License \u00a9 [Pavlo (Paul) Buidenkov](https://github.com/pavlobu/deskreen)\n\n## Copyright\n\nDeskreen Logo PNG Image -- \u00a9 [Nadiia Plaunova](https://www.artstation.com/nadiiia)\n\nApache 2.0 \u00a9 [blueprintjs](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint)\n\nMIT \u00a9 [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate)\n\nsimple-peer MIT.
