You need to create mapped\n    volume to access song files\n\n    ```bash\n    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/music spotdl download [trackUrl]\n    ```\n\n - Build from source\n\t```bash\n\tgit clone https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader && cd spotify-downloader\n\tpip install poetry\n\tpoetry install\n\tpoetry run python3 scripts/build.py\n\t```\n\tAn executable is created in `spotify-downloader/dist/`.\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Installing FFmpeg\n\nFFmpeg is required for spotDL. If using FFmpeg only for spotDL, you can simply install FFmpeg to your spotDL installation directory:\n`spotdl --download-ffmpeg`\n\nWe recommend the above option, but if you want to install FFmpeg system-wide,\nfollow these instructions\n\n- [Windows Tutorial](https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/)\n- OSX - `brew install ffmpeg`\n- Linux - `sudo apt install ffmpeg` or use your distro's package manager\n\n## Usage\n\nUsing SpotDL without options::\n```sh\nspotdl [urls]\n```\nYou can run _spotDL_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:\n```sh\npython -m spotdl [urls]\n```\n\nGeneral usage:\n```sh\nspotdl [operation] [options] QUERY\n```\n\nThere are different **operations** spotDL can perform. The *default* is `download`, which simply downloads the songs from YouTube and embeds metadata.\n\nThe **query** for spotDL is usually a list of Spotify URLs, but for some operations like **sync**, only a single link or file is required.\nFor a list of all **options** use ```spotdl -h```\n\n<details>\n<summary style=\"font-size:1em\"><strong>Supported operations</strong></summary>\n\n- `save`: Saves only the metadata from Spotify without downloading anything.\n    - Usage:\n        `spotdl save [query] --save-file {filename}.spotdl`\n\n- `web`: Starts a web interface instead of using the command line. However, it has limited features and only supports downloading single songs.\n\n- `url`: Get direct download link for each song from the query.\n    - Usage:\n        `spotdl url [query]`\n\n- `sync`: Updates directories. Compares the directory with the current state of the playlist. Newly added songs will be downloaded and removed songs will be deleted. No other songs will be downloaded and no other files will be deleted.\n\n    - Usage:\n        `spotdl sync [query] --save-file {filename}.spotdl`\n\n        This create a new **sync** file, to update the directory in the future, use:\n\n        `spotdl sync {filename}.spotdl`\n\n- `meta`: Updates metadata for the provided song files.\n\n</details>\n\n## Music Sourcing and Audio Quality\n\nspotDL uses YouTube as a source for music downloads. This method is used to avoid any issues related to downloading music from Spotify.\n\n> **Note**\n> Users are responsible for their actions and potential legal consequences. We do not support unauthorized downloading of copyrighted material and take no responsibility for user actions.\n\n### Audio Quality\n\nspotDL downloads music from YouTube and is designed to always download the highest possible bitrate; which is 128 kbps for regular users and 256 kbps for YouTube Music premium users.\n\nCheck the [Audio Formats](docs/usage.md#audio-formats-and-quality) page for more info.\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing?
