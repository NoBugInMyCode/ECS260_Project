The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python\ninterpreter or any modules.\n\n:Documentation: https://pyinstaller.org/\n:Code:          https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller\n\nPyInstaller reads a Python script written by you. It analyzes your code\nto discover every other module and library your script needs in order to\nexecute. Then it collects copies of all those files -- including the active\nPython interpreter! -- and puts them with your script in a single folder, or\noptionally in a single executable file.\n\n\nPyInstaller is tested against Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux.\nHowever, it is not a cross-compiler:\nto make a Windows app you run PyInstaller in Windows; to make\na GNU/Linux app you run it in GNU/Linux, etc.\nPyInstaller has been used successfully\nwith AIX, Solaris, FreeBSD and OpenBSD,\nbut is not tested against them as part of the continuous integration tests.\n\n\nMain Advantages\n---------------\n\n- Works out-of-the-box with any Python version 3.8-3.13.\n- Fully multi-platform, and uses the OS support to load the dynamic libraries,\n  thus ensuring full compatibility.\n- Correctly bundles the major Python packages such as numpy, PyQt5,\n  PySide2, PyQt6, PySide6, wxPython, matplotlib and others out-of-the-box.\n- Compatible with many 3rd-party packages out-of-the-box. (All the required\n  tricks to make external packages work are already integrated.)\n- Works with code signing on macOS.\n- Bundles MS Visual C++ DLLs on Windows.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPyInstaller is available on PyPI. You can install it through `pip`:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n      pip install pyinstaller\n\n\nRequirements and Tested Platforms\n---------------------------------\n\n- Python:\n    - 3.8-3.13. Note that Python 3.10.0 contains a bug making it unsupportable by\n      PyInstaller. PyInstaller will also not work with beta releases of Python\n      3.14.\n- Windows (32bit/64bit/ARM64):\n    - PyInstaller should work on Windows 7 or newer, but we only officially support Windows 8+.\n    - Support for Python installed from the Windows store without using virtual\n      environments requires PyInstaller 4.4 or later.\n- Linux:\n    - GNU libc based distributions on architectures ``x86_64``, ``aarch64``,\n      ``i686``, ``ppc64le``, ``s390x``.\n    - musl libc based distributions on architectures ``x86_64``, ``aarch64``.\n    - ldd: Console application to print the shared libraries required\n      by each program or shared library. This typically can be found in\n      the distribution-package `glibc` or `libc-bin`.\n    - objdump: Console application to display information from\n      object files. This typically can be found in the\n      distribution-package `binutils`.\n    - objcopy: Console application to copy and translate object files.\n      This typically can be found in the distribution-package `binutils`,\n      too.\n    - Raspberry Pi users on ``armv5``-``armv7`` should `add piwheels as an extra\n      index url <https://www.piwheels.org/>`_ then ``pip install pyinstaller``\n      as usual.\n- macOS (``x86_64`` or ``arm64``):\n    - macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or newer.\n    - Supports building ``universal2`` applications provided that your installation\n      of Python and all your dependencies are also compiled ``universal2``.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nBasic usage is very simple, just run it against your main script:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n      pyinstaller /path/to/yourscript.py\n\nFor more details, see the `manual`_.\n\n\nUntested Platforms\n------------------\n\nThe following platforms have been contributed and any feedback or\nenhancements on these are welcome.\n\n- FreeBSD\n    - ldd\n- Solaris\n    - ldd\n    - objdump\n- AIX\n    - AIX 6.1 or newer. PyInstaller will not work with statically\n      linked Python libraries.\n    - ldd\n- Linux on any other libc implementation/architecture combination not listed\n  above.\n\nBefore using any contributed platform, you need to build the PyInstaller\nbootloader. This will happen automatically when you ``pip install\npyinstaller`` provided that you have an appropriate C compiler (typically\neither ``gcc`` or ``clang``) and zlib's development headers already installed.\n\n\nSupport\n-------\n\n- Official debugging guide: https://pyinstaller.org/en/v6.11.1/when-things-go-wrong.html\n- Assorted user contributed help topics: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki\n- Web based Q&A forums: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/discussions\n- Email based Q&A forums: https://groups.google.com/g/pyinstaller\n\n\nChanges in this Release\n-----------------------\n\nYou can find a detailed list of changes in this release\nin the `Changelog`_ section of the manual.\n\n.. _`manual`: https://pyinstaller.org/en/v6.11.1/\n.. _`Changelog`: https://pyinstaller.org/en/v6.11.1/CHANGES.html\n",
