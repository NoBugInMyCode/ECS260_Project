For more information about printing your\nown copies, or on getting PDFs of the books, see [PRINTING.md][] for more information.\n\n\nContributing\n-------------\nIf you'd like to contribute a PR _**please read our [contribution guidelines][CONTRIBUTING]\nfirst**_.\n\n\nProject Status\n---------------\nVersion 4 has shipped! Three and a half years in the making, with massive changes to all three books\nand accompanying code. Our current version is v4.0.1.\n\nIf you'd like to check out the latest updates and watch our progress, we're on the `dev-patch`,\n`dev-minor`, and `dev-major` branches. You can also browse our issues and milestones to see what\nwe're planning.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing, email us! You can find our contact info at the head of each\nbook. Or just start [a new discussion][discussions] or [issue][issues].\n\n\nGitHub Discussions\n------------------\nDo you have general questions about raytracing code, issues with your own implmentation, or general\nraytracing ideas you'd like to share? Check out our [GitHub discussions][discussions] forum!\n\n\nDirectory Structure\n-------------------\nThe organization of this repository is meant to be simple and self-evident at a glance:\n\n  - `books/` --\n    This folder contains the three raytracing books (in HTML), and some supporting material.\n\n  - `images/` --\n    Contains all of the images and figures of the books. Can also be used to compare your\n    results.\n\n  - `style/` --\n    Contains the css for the books and the site.\n\n  - `src/` --\n    Contains the source.\n\n  - `src/<book>/` --\n    Contains the final source code for each book.\n\n\nSource Code\n-----------\n### Intent\nThis repository is not meant to act as its own tutorial. The source is provided so you can compare\nyour work when progressing through the book. We strongly recommend reading and following along with\nthe book to understand the source. Ideally, you'll be developing your own implementation as you go,\nin order to deeply understand how a raytracer works.\n\n### Downloading The Source Code\nThe [GitHub home][] for this project contains all source and documentation associated with the _Ray\nTracing in One Weekend_ book series. To clone or download the source code, see the green \"Clone or\ndownload\" button in the upper right of the project home page.\n\n### Programming Language\nThis book is written in C++, and uses some modern features of C++11. The language and features were\nchosen to be broadly understood by the largest collection of programmers. It is not meant to\nrepresent ideal (or optimized) C++ code.\n\n### Implementations in Other Languages\nThe _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ series has a long history of implementations in other programming\nlanguages (see [Implementations in Other Languages][implementations]), and across different\noperating systems. Feel free to add your own implementation to the list!\n\n### Branches\nIn general, ongoing development, with all of the latest changes, can be found in the `dev-patch`,\n`dev-minor`, and `dev-major` branches, minor and major changes, depending on the change level and\nrelease in progress. We try to keep CHANGELOG.md up to date, so you can easily browse what's new in\neach development branch. We may from time to time use additional development branches, so stay up to\ndate by reviewing the [CONTRIBUTING][] page.\n\nThe `release` branch contains the latest released (and live) assets. This is the branch from which\nGitHub pages serves up https://raytracing.github.io/.\n\n\nBuilding and Running\n---------------------\nCopies of the source are provided for you to check your work and compare against. If you wish to\nbuild the provided source, this project uses CMake. To build, go to the root of the project\ndirectory and run the following commands to create the debug version of every executable:\n\n    $ cmake -B build\n    $ cmake --build build\n\nYou should run `cmake -B build` whenever you change your project `CMakeLists.txt` file (like when\nadding a new source file).\n\nYou can specify the target with the `--target <program>` option, where the program may be\n`inOneWeekend`, `theNextWeek`, `theRestOfYourLife`, or any of the demonstration programs. By default\n(with no `--target` option), CMake will build all targets.\n\n    $ cmake --build build --target inOneWeekend\n\n### Optimized Builds\nCMake supports Release and Debug configurations. These require slightly different invocations\nacross Windows (MSVC) and Linux/macOS (using GCC or Clang). The following instructions will place\noptimized binaries under `build/Release` and debug binaries (unoptimized and containing debug\nsymbols) under `build/Debug`:\n\nOn Windows:\n\n```shell\n$ cmake -B build\n$ cmake --build build --config Release  # Create release binaries in `build\\Release`\n$ cmake --build build --config Debug    # Create debug binaries in `build\\Debug`\n```\n\nOn Linux / macOS:\n\n```shell\n# Configure and build release binaries under `build/Release`\n$ cmake -B build/Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n$ cmake --build build/Release\n\n# Configure and build debug binaries under `build/Debug`\n$ cmake -B build/Debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\n$ cmake --build build/Debug\n```\n\nWe recommend building and running the `Release` version (especially before the final render) for\nthe fastest results, unless you need the extra debug information provided by the (default) debug\nbuild.\n\n### CMake GUI on Windows\nYou may choose to use the CMake GUI when building on windows.\n\n1. Open CMake GUI on Windows\n2. For \"Where is the source code:\", set to location of the copied directory. For example,\n   `C:\\Users\\Peter\\raytracing.github.io`.\n3. Add the folder \"build\" within the location of the copied directory. For example,\n   `C:\\Users\\Peter\\raytracing.github.io\\build`.\n4. For \"Where to build the binaries\", set this to the newly-created \"build\" directory.\n5. Click \"Configure\".\n6. For \"Specify the generator for this project\", set this to your version of Visual Studio.\n7. Click \"Done\".\n8. Click \"Configure\" again.\n9. Click \"Generate\".\n10. In File Explorer, navigate to build directory and double click the newly-created `.sln` project.\n11. Build in Visual Studio.\n\nIf the project is succesfully cloned and built, you can then use the native terminal of your\noperating system to simply print the image to file.\n\n### Running The Programs\n\nYou can run the programs by executing the binaries placed in the build directory:\n\n    $ build\\Debug\\inOneWeekend > image.ppm\n\nor, run the optimized version (if you compiled with the release configuration):\n\n    $ build\\Release\\inOneWeekend > image.ppm\n\nThe generated PPM file can be viewed directly as a regular computer image, if your operating system\nsupports this image type. If your system doesn't handle PPM files, then you should be able to find\nPPM file viewers online. We like [ImageMagick][].\n\n\nCorrections & Contributions\n----------------------------\nIf you spot errors, have suggested corrections, or would like to help out with the project,\n_**please review the [CONTRIBUTING][] document for the most effective way to proceed.**_\n\n\n\n[book1]:           books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html\n[book2]:           books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html\n[book3]:           books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html\n[CONTRIBUTING]:    CONTRIBUTING.md\n[cover1]:          images/cover/CoverRTW1-small.jpg\n[cover2]:          images/cover/CoverRTW2-small.jpg\n[cover3]:          images/cover/CoverRTW3-small.jpg\n[discussions]:     https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/discussions/\n[GitHub home]:     https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/\n[ImageMagick]:     https://imagemagick.org/\n[implementations]: https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/wiki/Implementations\n[issues]:          https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/issues/\n[PRINTING.md]:     PRINTING.md\n[web1]:            https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html\n[web2]:            https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html\n[web3]:            https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html\n",
