It is a high-performance RPC framework based on name service and Tars protocol, also integrated administration platform, and implemented hosting-service via flexible schedule.\n\nTars, aka TAF(Total Application Framework), has been used in Tencent since 2008. It supports C++, Java, Nodejs and PHP for now. This framework offers a set of solution for development, maintenance and testing, which making development, deployment and testing service efficiently.\nIt integrated extensible protocol for encoding/decoding, high-performance RPC communication framework, name service, monitor, statistics and configuration. You can use it to develop your reliable distributed application based on microservice fast, and reach fully efficient service management.\n\nNowadays it's used by hundreds of bussiness in Tencent, services that developed base on TAF run on 16 thousands of machines.\n\nSee the detailed introduction [SUMMARY.md](https://tarscloud.github.io/TarsDocs_en/).\n\n## Supported platforms\nFor now it supports OS as below:\n\n- Linux\n- Mac(>=2.1.0 support)\n- Windows (>= Windows 7)\n\n## Supported languages\n\nFor now it supports following languages:\n\n- C++\n- Java\n- Nodejs\n- PHP\n- Go\n \n## Version Management\n \nTars is composed of many modules, scattered in many warehouses, and the basic framework version and language version can develop independently.
