See [http://dlib.net](http://dlib.net) for the main project documentation and API reference.\n\n\n\n## Compiling dlib C++ example programs\n\nGo into the examples folder and type:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build; cd build; cmake .. ; cmake --build .\n```\n\nThat will build all the examples.\nIf you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions then turn them on like this:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=1; cmake --build .\n```\n\nDoing so will make some things run faster.\n\nFinally, Visual Studio users should usually do everything in 64bit mode.  By default Visual Studio is 32bit, both in its outputs and its own execution, so you have to explicitly tell it to use 64bits.  Since it's not the 1990s anymore you probably want to use 64bits.  Do that with a cmake invocation like this:\n```bash\ncmake .. -G \"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64\" -T host=x64 \n```\n\n## Compiling your own C++ programs that use dlib\n\nThe examples folder has a [CMake tutorial](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/examples/CMakeLists.txt) that tells you what to do.  There are also additional instructions on the [dlib web site](http://dlib.net/compile.html).\n\nAlternatively, if you are using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager you can download and install dlib with CMake integration in a single command:\n```bash\nvcpkg install dlib\n```\n\n## Compiling dlib Python API\n\nBefore you can run the Python example programs you must install the build requirement.\n```bash\npython -m venv venv\npip install build\n```\n\nThen you must compile dlib and install it in your environment. Type:\n```bash\npython -m build --wheel\npip install dist/dlib-<version>.whl\n```\n\nOr download dlib using PyPi:\n```bash\npip install dlib\n```\n\n## Running the unit test suite\n\nType the following to compile and run the dlib unit test suite:\n\n```bash\ncd dlib/test\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\ncmake --build . --config Release\n./dtest --runall\n```\n\nNote that on windows your compiler might put the test executable in a subfolder called `Release`. If that's the case then you have to go to that folder before running the test.\n\nThis library is licensed under the Boost Software License, which can be found in [dlib/LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/dlib/LICENSE.txt).  The long and short of the license is that you can use dlib however you like, even in closed source commercial software.\n\n## dlib sponsors\n\nThis research is based in part upon work supported by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) under contract number 2014-14071600010.
