With fontello you can:\n\n1. shrink glyph collections, minimizing font size\n2. merge symbols from several fonts into a single file\n3. access large sets of professional-grade open source icons\n\n\n## Developers API\n\nFontello allows easy scripting, to implement different convenient features:\n\n1. Open site from command line, with your configuration, and import edited project\n    - [Makefile example](https://gist.github.com/puzrin/5537065). That's a live working code, used\n      for development of fontello itself.\n2. Writing website plugins, to import/export icons via admin panel.\n\nWhen more examples available, those will be added here.\n\n\n### API methods\n\n1. `POST https://fontello.com/` creates a session with your config and\n   return you `session_id`. You can use it later to open fontello with your configuration\n   and to automatically download your font. Session is stored for 24h. POST params\n   (form-encoded):\n    - `config` - (Required) content of `config.json` for your font\n    - `url` - (Optional) if used, download button will link to your admin panel, where you can\n      run importing script.\n2. `https://fontello.com/[session_id]` - opening fontello with your config preloaded.\n   When you edit font, your config is automatically sent to server\n3. `https://fontello.com/[session_id]/get` - download your font.\n\nNote. When you open site via API url, `download` button will have another text.\n\n\n### Examples\n\n* [Makefile](https://gist.github.com/puzrin/5537065) - quick load iconic font\n  from your project via CLI & save result back.\n* [fontello-cli](https://github.com/paulyoung/fontello-cli) - the same, as above,\n  but written in `node.js`. If you don't like `make` utility, then\n  `fontello-cli` is for you :)\n* [fontello_rails_converter](https://github.com/railslove/fontello_rails_converter) - Ruby CLI gem for interacting with the API.  Additional features (Sass conversion) for Rails integration, but should work for every project.\n* [grunt-fontello](https://github.com/jubalm/grunt-fontello) - lightweight integration with grunt\n\n## Authors\n\n- Roman Shmelev ([shmelev](https://github.com/shmelev)).\n- Vitaly Puzrin ([puzrin](https://github.com/puzrin)).\n- Aleksey Zapparov ([ixti](https://github.com/ixti)).\n- Evgeny Shkuropat ([shkuropat](https://github.com/shkuropat)).\n- Vladimir Zapparov ([dervus](https://github.com/dervus)).\n- Alex Kocharin ([rlidwka](https://github.com/rlidwka)).\n\nThanks to:\n\n- [Werner Lemberg](https://github.com/lemzwerg) for help with ttfautohint.\n- [Hermanto Lim](https://github.com/nackle2k10) for the image.\n\n\n## License\n\nFontello's code (all files, except fonts) is distributed under MIT license.
