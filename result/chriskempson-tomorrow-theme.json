Tomorrow theme is a colourful theme with muted colours and sensible syntax highlighting.\n\nA theme should aid your work by providing easily identifiable colours that add meaning and enhance legibility. This was the main focus when developing Tomorrow Theme.\n\n## Take a look!\n![Ruby Code in Tomorrow Night](Images/Tomorrow-Night.png)\n![Ruby Code in Tomorrow](Images/Tomorrow.png)\n![Ruby Code in Tomorrow Night Eighties](Images/Tomorrow-Night-Eighties.png)\n![Ruby Code in Tomorrow Night Blue](Images/Tomorrow-Night-Blue.png)\n![Ruby Code in Tomorrow Night Bright](Images/Tomorrow-Night-Bright.png)\n\n## Colour Palettes\n\n### Tomorrow Night\n![Tomorrow Night](Images/Tomorrow-Night-Palette.png)\n\n### Tomorrow\n![Tomorrow](Images/Tomorrow-Palette.png)\n\n### Tomorrow Night Eighties\n![Tomorrow Night Eighties](Images/Tomorrow-Night-Eighties-Palette.png)\n\n### Tomorrow Night Blue\n![Tomorrow Night Blue](Images/Tomorrow-Night-Blue-Palette.png)\n\n### Tomorrow Night Bright\n![Tomorrow Night Bright](Images/Tomorrow-Night-Bright-Palette.png)\n",
