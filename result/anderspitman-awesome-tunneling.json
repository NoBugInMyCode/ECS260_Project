        "readme": "The purpose of this list is to track and compare tunneling solutions. This is\nprimarily targeted toward self-hosters and developers who want to do things\nlike exposing a local webserver via a public domain name, with automatic HTTPS,\neven if behind a NAT or other restricted network.\n\n**NOTE:** We're building a community around self-hosting, data ownership, and decentralization in general.\nJoin us over at [IndieBits.io](https://forum.indiebits.io).\n\n# The dream\n\nI started this list because I'm looking for a simple tool/service that does the\nfollowing:\n\n* Allows me to register a domain name and automatically points the records at\n  the server running the tunnels.\n* Automatically sets up and manages HTTPS certificates (apex and subdomains)\n  for the domain.\n* Provides a client tool that tunnels HTTP/TCP connections through the server\n  without requiring root on the client.\n* Provides a simple GUI interface to allow me to map X domain/subdomain to Y port\n  on Z client, and proxy all connections to that domain.\n\nSo far I haven't found a tool that does all of this. In particular, while some\nof them can do automatic certs through Let's Encrypt, none of them integrate\nthe domain registration and DNS management in a simple way.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n* For most people, I currently recommend [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/). Although it's closed source, this is the production-quality service that gets the closest to achieving the dream. It's also a loss-leader for Cloudflare's other products which means they can offer it for free.\n* If you want to self-host, there are many options. For something production ready [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) is probably what you want. If you're a developer, I'd recommend starting with my own [SirTunnel](https://github.com/anderspitman/SirTunnel) project and modifying it for your needs. For non-developers and those wanting more of a GUI experience, I created [boringproxy](https://boringproxy.io/). It's my take on a comprehensive tunnel proxy solution. It's in beta but currently solves almost everything I want. Once the server is running this is a very easy tool to use and has some nice features.\n\n# Open source (at least with a reasonably permissive license)\n* [Telebit](https://telebit.cloud/) - Written in JS. [Code](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/telebit.js). \n* [tunnel.pyjam.as](https://tunnel.pyjam.as/) - No custom client; uses WireGuard directly instead. Written in Python.
