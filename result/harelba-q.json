Use `-C readwrite` or `-C read` to enable it for a query, or add `caching_mode` to `.qrc` to set a new default.\n \nq's web site is [https://harelba.github.io/q/](https://harelba.github.io/q/) or [https://q.textasdata.wiki](https://q.textasdata.wiki) It contains everything you need to download and use q immediately.\n\n\n## Usage Examples\nq treats ordinary files as database tables, and supports all SQL constructs, such as `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`s, etc. It supports automatic column name and type detection, and provides full support for multiple character encodings.\n\nHere are some example commands to get the idea:\n\n```bash\n$ q \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ./clicks_file.csv WHERE c3 > 32.3\"\n\n$ ps -ef | q -H \"SELECT UID, COUNT(*) cnt FROM - GROUP BY UID ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 3\"\n\n$ q \"select count(*) from some_db.sqlite3:::albums a left join another_db.sqlite3:::tracks t on (a.album_id = t.album_id)\"\n```\n\nDetailed examples are in [here](https://harelba.github.io/q/#examples)\n\n## Installation.\n**New Major Version `3.1.6` is out with a lot of significant additions.**\n\nInstructions for all OSs are [here](https://harelba.github.io/q/#installation).\n\nThe previous version `2.0.19` Can still be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/harelba/q/releases/tag/2.0.19)  \n\n## Contact\nAny feedback/suggestions/complaints regarding this tool would be much appreciated. Contributions are most welcome as well, of course.\n\nLinkedin: [Harel Ben Attia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harelba/)\n\nTwitter [@harelba](https://twitter.com/harelba)\n\nEmail [harelba@gmail.com](mailto:harelba@gmail.com)\n\nq on twitter: [#qtextasdata](https://twitter.com/hashtag/qtextasdata?src=hashtag_click)\n\nPatreon: [harelba](https://www.patreon.com/harelba) - All the money received is donated to the [Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Domestic Violence](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/bureaus/molsa-almab-ramla) in my hometown - Ramla, Israel.\n\n\n",
