It creates a virtual microphone that suppresses noise in any application using [RNNoise](https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise). Use whichever conferencing or VOIP application you like and simply select the filtered Virtual Microphone as input to torch the sound of your mechanical keyboard, computer fans, trains and the likes.\n\nDon't forget to leave a star \u2b50 if this sounds useful to you! \n\n## Regarding the recent security incident\n\nDue to a suspected security breach of the update server and code repository, there's\n been a concerted effort by the NoiseTorch community to ensure the source code and\n binaries are free from malicious code.\n \n > No malicious code has been found.\n \n You can read more about the audit that was done [here](https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch/discussions/275)\n and [here](https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch/discussions/264).\n Updates will now be retrieved from the project's releases page to avoid any risk\n of this reoccurring. We thank everyone for their trust and the love that they've\n shown towards the project in this unpleasant time. \n\n## Screenshot\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/T2wH0bl.png)\n\nThen simply select \"Filtered\" as your microphone in any application. OBS, Mumble, Discord, anywhere.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nimi7Ne.png)\n\n## Demo\n\nLinux For Everyone has a good demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzN9rYNeeIU).\n\n## Features\n* Two click setup of your virtual denoising microphone\n* A single, small, statically linked, self-contained binary\n\n## Download & Install\n\n[Download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch/releases).\n\nUnpack the `tgz` file, into your home directory.\n\n    tar -C $HOME -h -xzf NoiseTorch_x64_v0.12.2.tgz\n\nThis will unpack the application, icon and desktop entry to the correct place.  \nDepending on your desktop environment you may need to wait for it to rescan for applications, or tell it to do a refresh now.\n\nWith gnome this can be done with:\n\n    gtk-update-icon-cache\n\nYou now have a `noisetorch` binary and desktop entry on your system.\n\nGive it the required permissions with `setcap`:\n\n    sudo setcap 'CAP_SYS_RESOURCE=+ep' ~/.local/bin/noisetorch\n\nIf NoiseTorch-ng doesn't start after installation, you may also have to make sure that `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. On most distributions e.g. Ubuntu, this should be the case by default. If it's not, make sure to append\n\n```\nif [ -d \"$HOME/.local/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n```\n\nto your `~/.profile`. If you do already have that, you may have to log in and out for it to actually apply if this is the first time you're using `~/.local/bin`.\n\n#### Uninstall\n\n    rm ~/.local/bin/noisetorch\n    rm ~/.local/share/applications/noisetorch.desktop\n    rm ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/noisetorch.png \n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nPlease see the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch/wiki/Troubleshooting) section in the wiki.\n\n## Usage\n\nSelect the microphone you want to denoise, and click \"Load\", NoiseTorch-ng will create a virtual microphone called \"Filtered Microphone\" that you can select in any application. Output filtering works the same way, simply output the applications you want to filter to \"Filtered Headphones\".\n\nWhen you're done using it, simply click \"Unload\" to remove it again, until you need it next time.\n\nThe slider \"Voice Activation Threshold\" under settings, allows you to choose how strict NoiseTorch-ng should be in only allowing your microphone to send sounds when it detects voice.. Generally you want this up as high as possible. With a decent microphone, you can turn this to the maximum of 95%. If you cut out during talking, slowly lower this strictness until you find a value that works for you.\n\nIf you set this to 0%, NoiseTorch-ng will still dampen noise, but not deactivate your microphone if it doesn't detect voice.\n\nPlease keep in mind that you will need to reload NoiseTorch-ng for these changes to apply.\n\nOnce NoiseTorch-ng has been loaded, feel free to close the window, the virtual microphone will continue working until you explicitly unload it. The NoiseTorch-ng process is not required anymore once it has been loaded.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Latency\n\nNoiseTorch-ng may introduce a small amount of latency for microphone filtering. The amount of inherent latency introduced by noise supression is 10ms, this is very low and should not be a problem. Additionally PulseAudio currently introduces a variable amount of latency that depends on your system. Lowering this latency [requires a change in PulseAudio](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/-/issues/120).\n\nOutput filtering currently introduces something on the order of ~100ms with pulseaudio. This should still be fine for regular conferences, VOIPing and gaming. Maybe not for competitive gaming teams.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n- [noise-suppression-for-voice](https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice): Denoising software which uses rnnoise. More complex to configure but offers more options. Requires more use of the terminal.\n\n- [Easy Effects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects): Package which offers a large number of different audio effects such as echo cancellation or noise removal. More complex to configure and only supports PipeWire. Denoising uses rnnoise.\n\n## Building from source\n\nInstall the Go compiler from [golang.org](https://golang.org/). And make sure you have a working C++ compiler.\n\n```shell\n git clone https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch # Clone the repository\n cd NoiseTorch # cd into the cloned repository\n make # build it\n```\n\nTo install it:\n\n```shell\nmkdir -p  ~/.local/bin\ncp ./bin/noisetorch ~/.local/bin/\ncp ./assets/noisetorch.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\ncp ./assets/icon/noisetorch.png ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps\n```\n\n## Special thanks to\n\n* [@lawl](https://github.com/lawl) Creator of NoiseTorch\n* [xiph.org](https://xiph.org)/[Mozilla's](https://mozilla.org) excellent [RNNoise](https://jmvalin.ca/demo/rnnoise/).\n* [@werman](https://github.com/werman/)'s [noise-suppression-for-voice](https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice/) for the inspiration\n* [@aarzilli](https://github.com/aarzilli/)'s [nucular](https://github.com/aarzilli/nucular) GUI toolkit for Go.\n* [Sallee Design](https://www.salleedesign.com) (info@salleedesign.com)'s Microphone Icon under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\n",
