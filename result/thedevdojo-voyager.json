Use [Voyager 1.5](https://github.com/the-control-group/voyager/tree/1.5)\n\n## Installation Steps\n\n### 1. Require the Package\n\nAfter creating your new Laravel application you can include the Voyager package with the following command:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require tcg/voyager\n```\n\n> If you are installing this on Laravel 10, we are working on getting a permanent release available; however, you can still use this with Larvel 10 by requiring the following:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require tcg/voyager dev-1.6-l10\n```\n\n### 2. Add the DB Credentials & APP_URL\n\nNext make sure to create a new database and add your database credentials to your .env file:\n\n```\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_DATABASE=homestead\nDB_USERNAME=homestead\nDB_PASSWORD=secret\n```\n\nYou will also want to update your website URL inside of the `APP_URL` variable inside the .env file:\n\n```\nAPP_URL=http://localhost:8000\n```\n\n### 3. Run The Installer\n\nLastly, we can install voyager. You can do this either with or without dummy data.\nThe dummy data will include 1 admin account (if no users already exists), 1 demo page, 4 demo posts, 2 categories and 7 settings.\n\nTo install Voyager without dummy simply run\n\n```bash\nphp artisan voyager:install\n```\n\nIf you prefer installing it with dummy run\n\n```bash\nphp artisan voyager:install --with-dummy\n```\n\nAnd we're all good to go!\n\nStart up a local development server with `php artisan serve` And, visit [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin).\n\n## Creating an Admin User\n\nIf you did go ahead with the dummy data, a user should have been created for you with the following login credentials:\n\n>**email:** `admin@admin.com`   \n>**password:** `password`\n\nNOTE: Please note that a dummy user is **only** created if there are no current users in your database.\n\nIf you did not go with the dummy user, you may wish to assign admin privileges to an existing user.\nThis can easily be done by running this command:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan voyager:admin your@email.com\n```\n\nIf you did not install the dummy data and you wish to create a new admin user, you can pass the `--create` flag, like so:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan voyager:admin your@email.com --create\n```\n\nAnd you will be prompted for the user's name and password.\n\n## Sponsors\n\nVoyager is proudly supported by our amazing sponsors.
