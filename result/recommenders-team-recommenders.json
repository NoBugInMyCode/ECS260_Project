The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks:\n\n- [Prepare Data](examples/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommendation algorithm.\n- [Model](examples/00_quick_start): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommendation algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).\n- [Evaluate](examples/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics.\n- [Model Select and Optimize](examples/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommendation models.\n- [Operationalize](examples/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure.\n\nSeveral utilities are provided in [recommenders](recommenders) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [Recommenders documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).\n\nFor a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents on the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).\n\nFor some of the practical scenarios where recommendation systems have been applied, see [scenarios](scenarios). \n\n## Getting Started\n\nWe recommend [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html?highlight=environment#conda-environment) for environment management, and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. To install the recommenders package and run an example notebook on Linux/WSL:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install gcc if it is not installed already. On Ubuntu, this could done by using the command\n# sudo apt install gcc\n\n# 2. Create and activate a new conda environment\nconda create -n <environment_name> python=3.9\nconda activate <environment_name>\n\n# 3. Install the core recommenders package. It can run all the CPU notebooks.\npip install recommenders\n\n# 4. create a Jupyter kernel\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name <environment_name> --display-name <kernel_name>\n\n# 5. Clone this repo within VSCode or using command line:\ngit clone https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders.git\n\n# 6. Within VSCode:\n#   a. Open a notebook, e.g., examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb;  \n#   b. Select Jupyter kernel <kernel_name>;\n#   c. Run the notebook.\n```\n\nFor more information about setup on other platforms (e.g., Windows and macOS) and different configurations (e.g., GPU, Spark and experimental features), see the [Setup Guide](SETUP.md).\n\nIn addition to the core package, several extras are also provided, including:\n+ `[gpu]`: Needed for running GPU models.\n+ `[spark]`: Needed for running Spark models.\n+ `[dev]`: Needed for development for the repo.\n+ `[all]`: `[gpu]`|`[spark]`|`[dev]`\n+ `[experimental]`: Models that are not thoroughly tested and/or may require additional steps in installation.\n\n## Algorithms\n\nThe table below lists the recommendation algorithms currently available in the repository.

In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode. In this table we show the results on Movielens 100k, running the algorithms for 15 epochs.\n\n| Algo | MAP | nDCG@k | Precision@k | Recall@k | RMSE | MAE | R<sup>2</sup> | Explained Variance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [ALS](examples/00_quick_start/als_movielens.ipynb) | 0.004732 |\t0.044239 |\t0.048462 |\t0.017796 | 0.965038 |\t0.753001 |\t0.255647 |\t0.251648 |\n| [BiVAE](examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/cornac_bivae_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.146126\t| 0.475077 |\t0.411771 |\t0.219145 | N/A |\tN/A |\tN/A |\tN/A |\n| [BPR](examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/cornac_bpr_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.132478\t| 0.441997 |\t0.388229 |\t0.212522 | N/A |\tN/A |\tN/A |\tN/A |\n| [FastAI](examples/00_quick_start/fastai_movielens.ipynb) | 0.025503 |\t0.147866 |\t0.130329 |\t0.053824 | 0.943084 |\t0.744337 |\t0.285308 |\t0.287671 |\n| [LightGCN](examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/lightgcn_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.088526 | 0.419846 | 0.379626 | 0.144336 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| [NCF](examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/ncf_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.107720\t| 0.396118 |\t0.347296 |\t0.180775 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| [SAR](examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb) | 0.110591 |\t0.382461 | \t0.330753 | 0.176385 | 1.253805 | 1.048484 |\t-0.569363 |\t0.030474 |\n| [SVD](examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/surprise_svd_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.012873\t| 0.095930 |\t0.091198 |\t0.032783 | 0.938681 | 0.742690 | 0.291967 | 0.291971 |\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
