There shouldn't be any\n  conflicting version of ffmpeg installed. Currently, this is only supported on Linux.\n\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge 'ffmpeg<4.3'\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n# Using the models on C++\n\nRefer to [example/cpp](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/examples/cpp).\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: the `libtorchvision` library includes the torchvision\ncustom ops as well as most of the C++ torchvision APIs. Those APIs do not come\nwith any backward-compatibility guarantees and may change from one version to\nthe next. Only the Python APIs are stable and with backward-compatibility\nguarantees. So, if you need stability within a C++ environment, your best bet is\nto export the Python APIs via torchscript.\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the API documentation on the pytorch website: <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html>\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for how to help out.\n\n## Disclaimer on Datasets\n\nThis is a utility library that downloads and prepares public datasets.
