Pure JavaScript and optional native libpq bindings.\n\n## Monorepo\n\nThis repo is a monorepo which contains the core [pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg) module as well as a handful of related modules.\n\n- [pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg)\n- [pg-pool](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg-pool)\n- [pg-native](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg-native)\n- [pg-cursor](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg-cursor)\n- [pg-query-stream](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg-query-stream)\n- [pg-connection-string](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg-connection-string)\n- [pg-protocol](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg-protocol)\n\n## Install\n```\nnpm install pg\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nEach package in this repo should have its own readme more focused on how to develop/contribute. For overall documentation on the project and the related modules managed by this repo please see:\n\n### :star: [Documentation](https://node-postgres.com) :star:\n\nThe source repo for the documentation is available for contribution [here](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/docs).\n\n### Features\n\n- Pure JavaScript client and native libpq bindings share _the same API_\n- Connection pooling\n- Extensible JS \u2194 PostgreSQL data-type coercion\n- Supported PostgreSQL features\n  - Parameterized queries\n  - Named statements with query plan caching\n  - Async notifications with `LISTEN/NOTIFY`\n  - Bulk import & export with `COPY TO/COPY FROM`\n\n### Extras\n\nnode-postgres is by design pretty light on abstractions. These are some handy modules we've been using over the years to complete the picture.\nThe entire list can be found on our [wiki](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Extras).\n\n## Support\n\nnode-postgres is free software. If you encounter a bug with the library please open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres). If you have questions unanswered by the documentation please open an issue pointing out how the documentation was unclear & I will do my best to make it better!\n\nWhen you open an issue please provide:\n\n- version of Node\n- version of Postgres\n- smallest possible snippet of code to reproduce the problem\n\nYou can also follow me [@briancarlson](https://twitter.com/briancarlson) if that's your thing. I try to always announce noteworthy changes & developments with node-postgres on Twitter.\n\n## Sponsorship :two_hearts:\n\nnode-postgres's continued development has been made possible in part by generous financial support from [the community](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/master/SPONSORS.md).\n\nIf you or your company are benefiting from node-postgres and would like to help keep the project financially sustainable [please consider supporting](https://github.com/sponsors/brianc) its development.\n\n## Contributing\n\n**:heart: contributions!**\n\nI will **happily** accept your pull request if it:\n\n- **has tests**\n- looks reasonable\n- does not break backwards compatibility\n\nIf your change involves breaking backwards compatibility please please point that out in the pull request & we can discuss & plan when and how to release it and what type of documentation or communication it will require.\n\n### Setting up for local development\n\n1. Clone the repo\n2. Ensure you have installed libpq-dev in your system.\n3. From your workspace root run `yarn` and then `yarn lerna bootstrap`\n4. Ensure you have a PostgreSQL instance running with SSL enabled and an empty database for tests\n5. Ensure you have the proper environment variables configured for connecting to the instance\n6. Run `yarn test` to run all the tests\n\n## Troubleshooting and FAQ\n\nThe causes and solutions to common errors can be found among the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/FAQ)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2020 Brian Carlson (brian.m.carlson@gmail.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
