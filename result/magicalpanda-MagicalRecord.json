It was named by Martin Fowler in his book Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. The interface to such an object would include functions such as Insert, Update, and Delete, plus properties that correspond more-or-less directly to the columns in the underlying database table.\n\n>\tActive record is an approach to accessing data in a database. A database table or view is wrapped into a class; thus an object instance is tied to a single row in the table. After creation of an object, a new row is added to the table upon save. Any object loaded gets its information from the database; when an object is updated, the corresponding row in the table is also updated. The\twrapper class implements accessor methods or properties for each column in the table or view.\n\n>\t*- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern)*\n\nMagicalRecord was inspired by the ease of Ruby on Rails' Active Record fetching. The goals of this code are:\n\n* Clean up my Core Data related code\n* Allow for clear, simple, one-line fetches\n* Still allow the modification of the NSFetchRequest when request optimizations are needed\n\n## Status of the project\n\nThis project's activity has stopped, superseded by Core Data itself. Our latest versions available are:\n\n- MagicalRecord 2.4.0, a stable version, available from tag '2.4.0' or `pod 'MagicalRecord', :git => 'https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord'`.\n- MagicalRecord 3.0.0, an experimental version, available in two flavors, one is branch `release/3.0` and the other is branch `maintenance/3.0`.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Installation](Docs/Installing-MagicalRecord.md)\n- [Getting Started](Docs/Getting-Started.md)\n- [Working with Managed Object Contexts](Docs/Working-with-Managed-Object-Contexts.md)\n- [Creating Entities](Docs/Creating-Entities.md)\n- [Deleting Entities](Docs/Deleting-Entities.md)\n- [Fetching Entities](Docs/Fetching-Entities.md)\n- [Saving Entities](Docs/Saving-Entities.md)\n- [Importing Data](Docs/Importing-Data.md)\n- [Logging](Docs/Logging.md)\n* [Other Resources](Docs/Other-Resources.md)\n\n## Support\n\nThis project's activity has stopped.
