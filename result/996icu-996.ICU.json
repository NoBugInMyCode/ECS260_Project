Serving a company that encourages the \"996\" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours per week.\nVisit [996 working hour system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/996_working_hour_system) on Wikipedia for more details.\n\n\nWhat can I do?\n---\n\n- Update this [list](blacklist/README.md) with evidence to help every worker.  [Third party perfect list channel](https://www.996action.com/index.php/889799)\n- Add this [badge](externals/instruction.md) to your project to support 996.ICU.  \n- License your awesome projects with the [Anti 996 License](LICENSE).  \n- Add [proposals](proposal/README.md) to give advice about the development of 996.ICU.\n- Go home at 6 pm without feeling sorry.\n\n\nVoices\n---\n\n### State Media\n- [The 996 shall disappear](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2019-04/15/c_1124370790.htm)\n\n\n### Capitalists\n- **Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba**: `It is a huge blessing to be able to '996'`.\n- **Richard Liu, founder of JD.com**: `We will never force our employee to work as '996'`.\n(However, as a result many anonymous employees claim that there is a **list** of departments which **ranked** them by overtime hours. The shortest will take punishments. And the leaders never leave evidences when asking employees to work as '996'.)\n- **Bai Ya, founder of Youzan**: `This will definitely be a right decision when we look back in a few years.`\n\n### Developers\n- **Guido van Rossum, founder of Python**: [`The '996' working schedule is inhumane.`](https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/1111628076801236993)\n\n\nPrinciples and purposes\n---\n\n* 996.ICU is an initiative initiated by IT practitioners. We welcome people from other fields and other countries to join the discussion.\n\n* This is not a political movement. We firmly uphold the labor law and request employers to respect the legitimate rights and interests of their employees.\n\n* It is great progress from closed source to open source, and it will also be great progress from open source to emphasizing labor rights at the same time. What we want is to create an open source software license that advocates workers' rights.\n\n* We are willing to hear all positive and constructive proposals and advocate mature and responsible speech.\n\n\nExpanding influence\n---\n\nPlease feel free to [translate 996.ICU's contents](i18n/README.md), adjust the format, add some contents or fix grammatical errors. Please note that adding too many translations is getting off the track.\n\nCommunity powers\n---\n\n - [955.WLB](https://github.com/formulahendry/955.WLB) is a repo that maintains a whitelist of 955 work-life balanced companies.\n - [996.LIST](https://github.com/fengT-T/996_list) is a repo of a rank list of 996 companies and 955 companies.\n - [996.YAOCL](https://github.com/boycott996/yaocl) Yet Another Overtime Corps List, current another anonymous voting list.\n - [996.Leave](https://github.com/623637646/996.Leave) encourages & introduces working overseas.\n - [996.RIP](https://web.archive.org/web/20190422174052/https://996.rip/) Old news never vanished.\n - [996.Petition](https://github.com/xokctah/996.petition) initiates petitions by sending open letters to relevant government departments.\n - [996.avengers](https://github.com/996-icu-avengers/Natasha) adds `996ICU` and `955WLB` tags on recruitment websites.\n - [996.OD](https://github.com/zheolong/996.OD.git) occupational diseases are the forewarning of ICU.\n - [996.Q](https://github.com/alexddhuang/996.Q) A repository to collect mocks, jokes, or gags about 996. \n - [996.survey](https://github.com/0594mazhiyuan/996.survey) A survey of the status of 996.\n - [support.996.ICU](https://github.com/msworkers/support.996.ICU) Microsoft and GitHub Workers Support 996.ICU\n - [996.Blockchain](https://github.com/996BC/996.Blockchain) Blockchain for the 996 evidence\n - [996.Error](https://github.com/MagicLu550/996Error) Collect \"996\" exceptions written in various languages and can be used directly in the project.\n\nWhere are the issues?\n---\n\nEven with interaction limits on, the issues area was totally out of control.\nSo I **personally** decided to switch it off, not by GitHub or others.\n\n\nLicense\n---\n\n[Anti-996 License](LICENSE)\n\n - The purpose of this license is to prevent anti-labour-law companies from using the software or codes under the license, and force those companies to weigh their way of working\n - See a [full list of projects](awesomelist/README.md) under Anti-996 License\n\n - This draft is adapted from the MIT license.
