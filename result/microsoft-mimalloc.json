Notable aspects of the design include:\n\n- __small and consistent__: the library is about 10k LOC using simple and\n  consistent data structures. This makes it very suitable\n  to integrate and adapt in other projects. For runtime systems it\n  provides hooks for a monotonic _heartbeat_ and deferred freeing (for\n  bounded worst-case times with reference counting).\n  Partly due to its simplicity, mimalloc has been ported to many systems (Windows, macOS,\n  Linux, WASM, various BSD's, Haiku, MUSL, etc) and has excellent support for dynamic overriding.\n  At the same time, it is an industrial strength allocator that runs (very) large scale\n  distributed services on thousands of machines with excellent worst case latencies.\n- __free list sharding__: instead of one big free list (per size class) we have\n  many smaller lists per \"mimalloc page\" which reduces fragmentation and\n  increases locality --\n  things that are allocated close in time get allocated close in memory.\n  (A mimalloc page contains blocks of one size class and is usually 64KiB on a 64-bit system).\n- __free list multi-sharding__: the big idea! Not only do we shard the free list\n  per mimalloc page, but for each page we have multiple free lists. In particular, there\n  is one list for thread-local `free` operations, and another one for concurrent `free`\n  operations. Free-ing from another thread can now be a single CAS without needing\n  sophisticated coordination between threads. Since there will be\n  thousands of separate free lists, contention is naturally distributed over the heap,\n  and the chance of contending on a single location will be low -- this is quite\n  similar to randomized algorithms like skip lists where adding\n  a random oracle removes the need for a more complex algorithm.\n- __eager page purging__: when a \"page\" becomes empty (with increased chance\n  due to free list sharding) the memory is marked to the OS as unused (reset or decommitted)\n  reducing (real) memory pressure and fragmentation, especially in long running\n  programs.\n- __secure__: _mimalloc_ can be built in secure mode, adding guard pages,\n  randomized allocation, encrypted free lists, etc. to protect against various\n  heap vulnerabilities. The performance penalty is usually around 10% on average\n  over our benchmarks.\n- __first-class heaps__: efficiently create and use multiple heaps to allocate across different regions.\n  A heap can be destroyed at once instead of deallocating each object separately.\n- __bounded__: it does not suffer from _blowup_ \\[1\\], has bounded worst-case allocation\n  times (_wcat_) (upto OS primitives), bounded space overhead (~0.2% meta-data, with low\n  internal fragmentation), and has no internal points of contention using only atomic operations.\n- __fast__: In our benchmarks (see [below](#performance)),\n  _mimalloc_ outperforms other leading allocators (_jemalloc_, _tcmalloc_, _Hoard_, etc),\n  and often uses less memory. A nice property is that it does consistently well over a wide range\n  of benchmarks. There is also good huge OS page support for larger server programs.\n\nThe [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc) gives a full overview of the API.\nYou can read more on the design of _mimalloc_ in the [technical report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mimalloc-free-list-sharding-in-action) which also has detailed benchmark results.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n### Branches\n\n* `master`: latest stable release (based on `dev2`).\n* `dev`: development branch for mimalloc v1. Use this branch for submitting PR's.\n* `dev2`: development branch for mimalloc v2. This branch is downstream of `dev` \n         (and is essentially equal to `dev` except for `src/segment.c`). Uses larger sliced segments to manage\n         mimalloc pages what can reduce fragmentation.\n* `dev3`: development branch for mimalloc v3-alpha. This branch is downstream of `dev`. This is still experimental,\n          but simplifies previous versions by having no segments any more. This improves sharing of memory \n          between threads, and on certain large workloads uses less memory with less fragmentation.\n\n### Releases\n\n* 2025-01-03, `v1.8.9`, `v2.1.9`, `v3.0.1-alpha`: Interim release. Support Windows arm64. New [guarded](#guarded) build that can place OS \n  guard pages behind objects to catch buffer overflows as they occur. \n  Many small fixes: build on Windows arm64, cygwin, riscV, and dragonfly; fix Windows static library initialization to account for\n  thread local destructors (in Rust/C++); macOS tag change; macOS TLS slot fix; improve stats; \n  consistent mimalloc.dll on Windows (instead of mimalloc-override.dll); fix mimalloc-redirect on Win11 H2; \n  add 0-byte to canary; upstream CPython fixes; reduce .bss size; allow fixed TLS slot on Windows for improved performance.\n* 2024-05-21, `v1.8.7`, `v2.1.7`: Fix build issues on less common platforms. Started upstreaming patches\n  from the CPython [integration](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113141#issuecomment-2119255217). Upstream `vcpkg` patches.\n* 2024-05-13, `v1.8.6`, `v2.1.6`: Fix build errors on various (older) platforms. Refactored aligned allocation.\n* 2024-04-22, `v1.8.4`, `v2.1.4`: Fixes various bugs and build issues. Add `MI_LIBC_MUSL` cmake flag for musl builds.\n  Free-ing code is refactored into a separate module (`free.c`). Mimalloc page info is simplified with the block size\n  directly available (and new `block_size_shift` to improve aligned block free-ing).\n  New approach to collection of abandoned segments: When\n  a thread terminates the segments it owns are abandoned (containing still live objects) and these can be\n  reclaimed by other threads. We no longer use a list of abandoned segments but this is now done using bitmaps in arena's\n  which is more concurrent (and more aggressive). Abandoned memory can now also be reclaimed if a thread frees an object in\n  an abandoned page (which can be disabled using `mi_option_abandoned_reclaim_on_free`). The option `mi_option_max_segment_reclaim`\n  gives a maximum percentage of abandoned segments that can be reclaimed per try (=10%).\n\n* 2023-04-24, `v1.8.2`, `v2.1.2`: Fixes build issues on freeBSD, musl, and C17 (UE 5.1.1). Reduce code size/complexity\n  by removing regions and segment-cache's and only use arenas with improved memory purging -- this may improve memory\n  usage as well for larger services. Renamed options for consistency. Improved Valgrind and ASAN checking.\n\n* 2023-04-03, `v1.8.1`, `v2.1.1`: Fixes build issues on some platforms.\n\n* 2023-03-29, `v1.8.0`, `v2.1.0`: Improved support dynamic overriding on Windows 11. Improved tracing precision\n  with [asan](#asan) and [Valgrind](#valgrind), and added Windows event tracing [ETW](#ETW) (contributed by Xinglong He). Created an OS\n  abstraction layer to make it easier to port and separate platform dependent code (in `src/prim`). Fixed C++ STL compilation on older Microsoft C++ compilers, and various small bug fixes.\n\n* 2022-12-23, `v1.7.9`, `v2.0.9`: Supports building with [asan](#asan) and improved [Valgrind](#valgrind) support.\n  Support arbitrary large alignments (in particular for `std::pmr` pools).\n  Added C++ STL allocators attached to a specific heap (thanks @vmarkovtsev).\n  Heap walks now visit all object (including huge objects). Support Windows nano server containers (by Johannes Schindelin,@dscho).\n  Various small bug fixes.\n\n* 2022-11-03, `v1.7.7`, `v2.0.7`: Initial support for [Valgrind](#valgrind) for leak testing and heap block overflow\n  detection. Initial\n  support for attaching heaps to a specific memory area (only in v2). Fix `realloc` behavior for zero size blocks, remove restriction to integral multiple of the alignment in `alloc_align`, improved aligned allocation performance, reduced contention with many threads on few processors (thank you @dposluns!), vs2022 support, support `pkg-config`, .\n\n* 2022-04-14, `v1.7.6`, `v2.0.6`: fix fallback path for aligned OS allocation on Windows, improve Windows aligned allocation\n  even when compiling with older SDK's, fix dynamic overriding on macOS Monterey, fix MSVC C++ dynamic overriding, fix\n  warnings under Clang 14, improve performance if many OS threads are created and destroyed, fix statistics for large object\n  allocations, using MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1 has no maximum on the number of error messages, various small fixes.\n\n* 2022-02-14, `v1.7.5`, `v2.0.5` (alpha): fix malloc override on\n  Windows 11, fix compilation with musl, potentially reduced\n  committed memory, add `bin/minject` for Windows,\n  improved wasm support, faster aligned allocation,\n  various small fixes.\n\n* [Older release notes](#older-release-notes)\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\n* [David Carlier](https://devnexen.blogspot.com/) (@devnexen) for his many contributions, and making\n  mimalloc work better on many less common operating systems, like Haiku, Dragonfly, etc.\n* Mary Feofanova (@mary3000), Evgeniy Moiseenko, and Manuel P\u00f6ter (@mpoeter) for making mimalloc TSAN checkable, and finding\n  memory model bugs using the [genMC] model checker.\n* Weipeng Liu (@pongba), Zhuowei Li, Junhua Wang, and Jakub Szymanski, for their early support of mimalloc and deployment\n  at large scale services, leading to many improvements in the mimalloc algorithms for large workloads.\n* Jason Gibson (@jasongibson) for exhaustive testing on large scale workloads and server environments, and finding complex bugs\n  in (early versions of) `mimalloc`.\n* Manuel P\u00f6ter (@mpoeter) and Sam Gross(@colesbury) for finding an ABA concurrency issue in abandoned segment reclamation. Sam also created the [no GIL](https://github.com/colesbury/nogil) Python fork which\n  uses mimalloc internally.\n\n\n[genMC]: https://plv.mpi-sws.org/genmc/\n\n### Usage\n\nmimalloc is used in various large scale low-latency services and programs, for example:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.bing.com\"><img height=\"50\" align=\"left\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Bing_logo.svg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/\"><img height=\"50\" align=\"left\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Microsoft_Azure_Logo.svg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://deathstrandingpc.505games.com\"><img height=\"100\" src=\"doc/ds-logo.png\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/WhatsNew/Builds/ReleaseNotes/4_25/\"><img height=\"100\" src=\"doc/unreal-logo.svg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/\"><img height=\"100\" src=\"doc/spades-logo.png\"></a>\n\n\n# Building\n\n## Windows\n\nOpen `ide/vs2022/mimalloc.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 and build.\nThe `mimalloc-lib` project builds a static library (in `out/msvc-x64`), while the\n`mimalloc-override-dll` project builds a DLL for overriding malloc\nin the entire program.\n\n## Linux, macOS, BSD, etc.\n\nWe use [`cmake`](https://cmake.org) as the build system:\n\n```\n> mkdir -p out/release\n> cd out/release\n> cmake ../..\n> make\n```\nThis builds the library as a shared (dynamic)\nlibrary (`.so` or `.dylib`), a static library (`.a`), and\nas a single object file (`.o`).\n\n`> sudo make install` (install the library and header files in `/usr/local/lib`  and `/usr/local/include`)\n\nYou can build the debug version which does many internal checks and\nmaintains detailed statistics as:\n\n```\n> mkdir -p out/debug\n> cd out/debug\n> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..\n> make\n```\n\nThis will name the shared library as `libmimalloc-debug.so`.\n\nFinally, you can build a _secure_ version that uses guard pages, encrypted free lists, etc., as:\n\n```\n> mkdir -p out/secure\n> cd out/secure\n> cmake -DMI_SECURE=ON ../..\n> make\n```\n\nThis will name the shared library as `libmimalloc-secure.so`.\nUse `cmake ../.. -LH` to see all the available build options.\n\nThe examples use the default compiler. If you like to use another, use:\n\n```\n> CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake ../..\n```\n\n## Cmake with Visual Studio\n\nYou can also use cmake on Windows. Open a Visual Studio 2022 development prompt \nand invoke `cmake` with the right [generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Visual%20Studio%2017%202022.html) \nand architecture, like:\n\n```\n> cmake ..\\.. -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -A x64 -DMI_OVERRIDE=ON\n```\n\nThe cmake build type is specified when actually building, for example:\n\n```\n> cmake --build . --config=Release\n```\n\nYou can also install the [LLVM toolset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-msbuild?view=msvc-170#install-1) \non Windows to build with the `clang-cl` compiler directly:\n\n```\n> cmake ../.. -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -T ClangCl\n```\n\n\n## Single source\n\nYou can also directly build the single `src/static.c` file as part of your project without\nneeding `cmake` at all. Make sure to also add the mimalloc `include` directory to the include path.\n\n\n# Using the library\n\nThe preferred usage is including `<mimalloc.h>`, linking with\nthe shared- or static library, and using the `mi_malloc` API exclusively for allocation. For example,\n```\n> gcc -o myprogram -lmimalloc myfile.c\n```\n\nmimalloc uses only safe OS calls (`mmap` and `VirtualAlloc`) and can co-exist\nwith other allocators linked to the same program.\nIf you use `cmake`, you can simply use:\n```\nfind_package(mimalloc 1.8 REQUIRED)\n```\nin your `CMakeLists.txt` to find a locally installed mimalloc. Then use either:\n```\ntarget_link_libraries(myapp PUBLIC mimalloc)\n```\nto link with the shared (dynamic) library, or:\n```\ntarget_link_libraries(myapp PUBLIC mimalloc-static)\n```\nto link with the static library. See `test\\CMakeLists.txt` for an example.\n\nFor best performance in C++ programs, it is also recommended to override the\nglobal `new` and `delete` operators. For convenience, mimalloc provides\n[`mimalloc-new-delete.h`](include/mimalloc-new-delete.h) which does this for you -- just include it in a single(!) source file in your project.\nIn C++, mimalloc also provides the `mi_stl_allocator` struct which implements the `std::allocator`\ninterface.\n\nYou can pass environment variables to print verbose messages (`MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1`)\nand statistics (`MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1`) (in the debug version):\n```\n> env MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1 ./cfrac 175451865205073170563711388363\n\n175451865205073170563711388363 = 374456281610909315237213 * 468551\n\nheap stats:     peak      total      freed       unit\nnormal   2:    16.4 kb    17.5 mb    17.5 mb      16 b   ok\nnormal   3:    16.3 kb    15.2 mb    15.2 mb      24 b   ok\nnormal   4:      64 b      4.6 kb     4.6 kb      32 b   ok\nnormal   5:      80 b    118.4 kb   118.4 kb      40 b   ok\nnormal   6:      48 b       48 b       48 b       48 b   ok\nnormal  17:     960 b      960 b      960 b      320 b   ok\n\nheap stats:     peak      total      freed       unit\n    normal:    33.9 kb    32.8 mb    32.8 mb       1 b   ok\n      huge:       0 b        0 b        0 b        1 b   ok\n     total:    33.9 kb    32.8 mb    32.8 mb       1 b   ok\nmalloc requested:         32.8 mb\n\n committed:    58.2 kb    58.2 kb    58.2 kb       1 b   ok\n  reserved:     2.0 mb     2.0 mb     2.0 mb       1 b   ok\n     reset:       0 b        0 b        0 b        1 b   ok\n  segments:       1          1          1\n-abandoned:       0\n     pages:       6          6          6\n-abandoned:       0\n     mmaps:       3\n mmap fast:       0\n mmap slow:       1\n   threads:       0\n   elapsed:     2.022s\n   process: user: 1.781s, system: 0.016s, faults: 756, reclaims: 0, rss: 2.7 mb\n```\n\nThe above model of using the `mi_` prefixed API is not always possible\nthough in existing programs that already use the standard malloc interface,\nand another option is to override the standard malloc interface\ncompletely and redirect all calls to the _mimalloc_ library instead .\n\n## Environment Options\n\nYou can set further options either programmatically (using [`mi_option_set`](https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc/group__options.html)), or via environment variables:\n\n- `MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1`: show statistics when the program terminates.\n- `MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1`: show verbose messages.\n- `MIMALLOC_SHOW_ERRORS=1`: show error and warning messages.\n\nAdvanced options:\n\n- `MIMALLOC_ARENA_EAGER_COMMIT=2`: turns on eager commit for the large arenas (usually 1GiB) from which mimalloc\n   allocates segments and pages. Set this to 2 (default) to\n   only enable this on overcommit systems (e.g. Linux). Set this to 1 to enable explicitly on other systems\n   as well (like Windows or macOS) which may improve performance (as the whole arena is committed at once).\n   Note that eager commit only increases the commit but not the actual the peak resident set\n   (rss) so it is generally ok to enable this.\n- `MIMALLOC_PURGE_DELAY=N`: the delay in `N` milli-seconds (by default `10`) after which mimalloc will purge\n   OS pages that are not in use. This signals to the OS that the underlying physical memory can be reused which\n   can reduce memory fragmentation especially in long running (server) programs. Setting `N` to `0` purges immediately when\n   a page becomes unused which can improve memory usage but also decreases performance. Setting `N` to a higher\n   value like `100` can improve performance (sometimes by a lot) at the cost of potentially using more memory at times.\n   Setting it to `-1` disables purging completely.\n- `MIMALLOC_PURGE_DECOMMITS=1`: By default \"purging\" memory means unused memory is decommitted (`MEM_DECOMMIT` on Windows,\n   `MADV_DONTNEED` (which decresease rss immediately) on `mmap` systems). Set this to 0 to instead \"reset\" unused\n   memory on a purge (`MEM_RESET` on Windows, generally `MADV_FREE` (which does not decrease rss immediately) on `mmap` systems).\n   Mimalloc generally does not \"free\" OS memory but only \"purges\" OS memory, in other words, it tries to keep virtual\n   address ranges and decommits within those ranges (to make the underlying physical memory available to other processes).\n\nFurther options for large workloads and services:\n\n- `MIMALLOC_USE_NUMA_NODES=N`: pretend there are at most `N` NUMA nodes. If not set, the actual NUMA nodes are detected\n   at runtime. Setting `N` to 1 may avoid problems in some virtual environments. Also, setting it to a lower number than\n   the actual NUMA nodes is fine and will only cause threads to potentially allocate more memory across actual NUMA\n   nodes (but this can happen in any case as NUMA local allocation is always a best effort but not guaranteed).\n- `MIMALLOC_ALLOW_LARGE_OS_PAGES=0`: Set to 1 to use large OS pages (2 or 4MiB) when available; for some workloads this can significantly\n   improve performance. When this option is disabled (default), it also disables transparent huge pages (THP) for the process\n   (on Linux and Android). On Linux the default setting is 2 -- this enables the use of large pages through THP only.\n   Use `MIMALLOC_VERBOSE` to check if the large OS pages are enabled -- usually one needs\n   to explicitly give permissions for large OS pages (as on [Windows][windows-huge] and [Linux][linux-huge]). However, sometimes\n   the OS is very slow to reserve contiguous physical memory for large OS pages so use with care on systems that\n   can have fragmented memory (for that reason, we generally recommend to use `MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES` instead whenever possible).\n- `MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES=N`: where `N` is the number of 1GiB _huge_ OS pages. This reserves the huge pages at\n   startup and sometimes this can give a large (latency) performance improvement on big workloads.\n   Usually it is better to not use `MIMALLOC_ALLOW_LARGE_OS_PAGES=1` in combination with this setting. Just like large\n   OS pages, use with care as reserving\n   contiguous physical memory can take a long time when memory is fragmented (but reserving the huge pages is done at\n   startup only once).\n   Note that we usually need to explicitly give permission for huge OS pages (as on [Windows][windows-huge] and [Linux][linux-huge])).\n   With huge OS pages, it may be beneficial to set the setting\n   `MIMALLOC_EAGER_COMMIT_DELAY=N` (`N` is 1 by default) to delay the initial `N` segments (of 4MiB)\n   of a thread to not allocate in the huge OS pages; this prevents threads that are short lived\n   and allocate just a little to take up space in the huge OS page area (which cannot be purged as huge OS pages are pinned\n   to physical memory).\n   The huge pages are usually allocated evenly among NUMA nodes.\n   We can use `MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES_AT=N` where `N` is the numa node (starting at 0) to allocate all\n   the huge pages at a specific numa node instead.\n\nUse caution when using `fork` in combination with either large or huge OS pages: on a fork, the OS uses copy-on-write\nfor all pages in the original process including the huge OS pages. When any memory is now written in that area, the\nOS will copy the entire 1GiB huge page (or 2MiB large page) which can cause the memory usage to grow in large increments.\n\n[linux-huge]: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/tuning_and_optimizing_red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_oracle_9i_and_10g_databases/sect-oracle_9i_and_10g_tuning_guide-large_memory_optimization_big_pages_and_huge_pages-configuring_huge_pages_in_red_hat_enterprise_linux_4_or_5\n[windows-huge]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-the-lock-pages-in-memory-option-windows?view=sql-server-2017\n\n## Secure Mode\n\n_mimalloc_ can be build in secure mode by using the `-DMI_SECURE=ON` flags in `cmake`. This build enables various mitigations\nto make mimalloc more robust against exploits. In particular:\n\n- All internal mimalloc pages are surrounded by guard pages and the heap metadata is behind a guard page as well (so a buffer overflow\n  exploit cannot reach into the metadata).\n- All free list pointers are\n  [encoded](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/blob/783e3377f79ee82af43a0793910a9f2d01ac7863/include/mimalloc-internal.h#L396)\n  with per-page keys which is used both to prevent overwrites with a known pointer, as well as to detect heap corruption.\n- Double free's are detected (and ignored).\n- The free lists are initialized in a random order and allocation randomly chooses between extension and reuse within a page to\n  mitigate against attacks that rely on a predicable allocation order. Similarly, the larger heap blocks allocated by mimalloc\n  from the OS are also address randomized.\n\nAs always, evaluate with care as part of an overall security strategy as all of the above are mitigations but not guarantees.\n\n## Debug Mode\n\nWhen _mimalloc_ is built using debug mode, (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`), \nvarious checks are done at runtime to catch development errors.\n\n- Statistics are maintained in detail for each object size. They can be shown using `MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1` at runtime.\n- All objects have padding at the end to detect (byte precise) heap block overflows.\n- Double free's, and freeing invalid heap pointers are detected.\n- Corrupted free-lists and some forms of use-after-free are detected.\n\n## Guarded Mode\n\n<span id=\"guarded\">_mimalloc_ can be build in guarded mode using the `-DMI_GUARDED=ON` flags in `cmake`.</span>\nThis enables placing OS guard pages behind certain object allocations to catch buffer overflows as they occur.\nThis can be invaluable to catch buffer-overflow bugs in large programs. However, it also means that any object\nallocated with a guard page takes at least 8 KiB memory for the guard page and its alignment. As such, allocating\na guard page for every allocation may be too expensive both in terms of memory, and in terms of performance with\nmany system calls. Therefore, there are various environment variables (and options) to tune this:\n\n- `MIMALLOC_GUARDED_SAMPLE_RATE=N`: Set the sample rate to `N` (by default 4000). This mode places a guard page\n  behind every `N` suitable object allocations (per thread). Since the performance in guarded mode without placing\n  guard pages is close to release mode, this can be used to enable guard pages even in production to catch latent \n  buffer overflow bugs. Set the sample rate to `1` to guard every object, and to `0` to place no guard pages at all.\n\n- `MIMALLOC_GUARDED_SAMPLE_SEED=N`: Start sampling at `N` (by default random). Can be used to reproduce a buffer\n  overflow if needed.\n\n- `MIMALLOC_GUARDED_MIN=N`, `MIMALLOC_GUARDED_MAX=N`: Minimal and maximal _rounded_ object sizes for which a guard \n  page is considered (`0` and `1GiB` respectively). If you suspect a buffer overflow occurs with an object of size\n  141, set the minimum and maximum to `148` and the sample rate to `1` to have all of those guarded.\n\n- `MIMALLOC_GUARDED_PRECISE=1`: If we have an object of size 13, we would usually place it an aligned 16 bytes in\n  front of the guard page. Using `MIMALLOC_GUARDED_PRECISE` places it exactly 13 bytes before a page so that even\n  a 1 byte overflow is detected. This violates the C/C++ minimal alignment guarantees though so use with care.\n\n\n# Overriding Standard Malloc\n\nOverriding the standard `malloc` (and `new`) can be done either _dynamically_ or _statically_.\n\n## Dynamic override\n\nThis is the recommended way to override the standard malloc interface.\n\n### Dynamic Override on Linux, BSD\n\nOn these ELF-based systems we preload the mimalloc shared\nlibrary so all calls to the standard `malloc` interface are\nresolved to the _mimalloc_ library.\n```\n> env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so myprogram\n```\n\nYou can set extra environment variables to check that mimalloc is running,\nlike:\n```\n> env MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so myprogram\n```\nor run with the debug version to get detailed statistics:\n```\n> env MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc-debug.so myprogram\n```\n\n### Dynamic Override on MacOS\n\nOn macOS we can also preload the mimalloc shared\nlibrary so all calls to the standard `malloc` interface are\nresolved to the _mimalloc_ library.\n```\n> env DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.dylib myprogram\n```\n\nNote that certain security restrictions may apply when doing this from\nthe [shell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43941322/dyld-insert-libraries-ignored-when-calling-application-through-bash).\n\n\n# Windows Override\n\n<span id=\"override_on_windows\">We use a separate redirection DLL to override mimalloc on Windows</span> \nsuch that we redirect all malloc/free calls that go through the (dynamic) C runtime allocator, \nincluding those from other DLL's or libraries. As it intercepts all allocation calls on a low level, \nit can be used reliably on large programs that include other 3rd party components.\nThere are four requirements to make the overriding work well:\n\n1. Use the C-runtime library as a DLL (using the `/MD` or `/MDd` switch).\n\n2. Link your program explicitly with the `mimalloc.dll.lib` export library for the `mimalloc.dll`.\n   (which must be compiled with `-DMI_OVERRIDE=ON`, which is the default though).\n   To ensure the `mimalloc.dll` is actually loaded at run-time it is easiest \n   to insert some call to the mimalloc API in the `main` function, like `mi_version()`\n   (or use the `/include:mi_version` switch on the linker command, or\n   similarly, `#pragma comment(linker, \"/include:mi_version\")` in some source file). \n   See the `mimalloc-test-override` project for an example on how to use this. \n\n3. The `mimalloc-redirect.dll` must be put in the same directory as the main \n   `mimalloc.dll` at runtime (as it is a dependency of that DLL).\n   The redirection DLL ensures that all calls to the C runtime malloc API get \n   redirected to mimalloc functions (which reside in `mimalloc.dll`).\n\n4. Ensure the `mimalloc.dll` comes as early as possible in the import\n   list of the final executable (so it can intercept all potential allocations).\n   You can use `minject -l <exe>` to check this if needed.\n\nFor best performance on Windows with C++, it is also recommended to also override \nthe `new`/`delete` operations (by including [`mimalloc-new-delete.h`](include/mimalloc-new-delete.h)\na single(!) source file in your project).\n\nThe environment variable `MIMALLOC_DISABLE_REDIRECT=1` can be used to disable dynamic\noverriding at run-time. Use `MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1` to check if mimalloc was successfully \nredirected.\n\nFor different platforms than x64, you may need a specific [redirection dll](bin).\nFurthermore, we cannot always re-link an executable or ensure `mimalloc.dll` comes\nfirst in the import table. In such cases the [`minject`](bin) tool can be used\nto patch the executable's import tables.\n\n\n## Static override\n\nOn Unix-like systems, you can also statically link with _mimalloc_ to override the standard\nmalloc interface. The recommended way is to link the final program with the\n_mimalloc_ single object file (`mimalloc.o`). We use\nan object file instead of a library file as linkers give preference to\nthat over archives to resolve symbols. To ensure that the standard\nmalloc interface resolves to the _mimalloc_ library, link it as the first\nobject file. For example:\n\n```\n> gcc -o myprogram mimalloc.o  myfile1.c ...\n```\n\nAnother way to override statically that works on all platforms, is to\nlink statically to mimalloc (as shown in the introduction) and include a\nheader file in each source file that re-defines `malloc` etc. to `mi_malloc`.\nThis is provided by [`mimalloc-override.h`](include/mimalloc-override.h). This only works \nreliably though if all sources are\nunder your control or otherwise mixing of pointers from different heaps may occur!\n\n\n# Tools\n\nGenerally, we recommend using the standard allocator with memory tracking tools, but mimalloc\ncan also be build to support the [address sanitizer][asan] or the excellent [Valgrind] tool.\nMoreover, it can be build to support Windows event tracing ([ETW]).\nThis has a small performance overhead but does allow detecting memory leaks and byte-precise\nbuffer overflows directly on final executables. See also the `test/test-wrong.c` file to test with various tools.\n\n## Valgrind\n\nTo build with [valgrind] support, use the `MI_TRACK_VALGRIND=ON` cmake option:\n\n```\n> cmake ../.. -DMI_TRACK_VALGRIND=ON\n```\n\nThis can also be combined with secure mode or debug mode.\nYou can then run your programs directly under valgrind:\n\n```\n> valgrind <myprogram>\n```\n\nIf you rely on overriding `malloc`/`free` by mimalloc (instead of using the `mi_malloc`/`mi_free` API directly),\nyou also need to tell `valgrind` to not intercept those calls itself, and use:\n\n```\n> MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1 valgrind  --soname-synonyms=somalloc=*mimalloc* -- <myprogram>\n```\n\nBy setting the `MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS` environment variable you can check that mimalloc is indeed\nused and not the standard allocator. Even though the [Valgrind option][valgrind-soname]\nis called `--soname-synonyms`, this also works when overriding with a static library or object file.\nTo dynamically override mimalloc using `LD_PRELOAD` together with `valgrind`, use:\n\n```\n> valgrind --trace-children=yes --soname-synonyms=somalloc=*mimalloc* /usr/bin/env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so -- <myprogram>\n```\n\nSee also the `test/test-wrong.c` file to test with `valgrind`.\n\nValgrind support is in its initial development -- please report any issues.\n\n[Valgrind]: https://valgrind.org/\n[valgrind-soname]: https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#opt.soname-synonyms\n\n## ASAN\n\nTo build with the address sanitizer, use the `-DMI_TRACK_ASAN=ON` cmake option:\n\n```\n> cmake ../.. -DMI_TRACK_ASAN=ON\n```\n\nThis can also be combined with secure mode or debug mode.\nYou can then run your programs as:'\n\n```\n> ASAN_OPTIONS=verbosity=1 <myprogram>\n```\n\nWhen you link a program with an address sanitizer build of mimalloc, you should\ngenerally compile that program too with the address sanitizer enabled.\nFor example, assuming you build mimalloc in `out/debug`:\n\n```\nclang -g -o test-wrong -Iinclude test/test-wrong.c out/debug/libmimalloc-asan-debug.a -lpthread -fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address\n```\n\nSince the address sanitizer redirects the standard allocation functions, on some platforms (macOSX for example)\nit is required to compile mimalloc with `-DMI_OVERRIDE=OFF`.\nAddress sanitizer support is in its initial development -- please report any issues.\n\n[asan]: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer\n\n## ETW\n\nEvent tracing for Windows ([ETW]) provides a high performance way to capture all allocations though\nmimalloc and analyze them later. To build with ETW support, use the `-DMI_TRACK_ETW=ON` cmake option.\n\nYou can then capture an allocation trace using the Windows performance recorder (WPR), using the\n`src/prim/windows/etw-mimalloc.wprp` profile. In an admin prompt, you can use:\n```\n> wpr -start src\\prim\\windows\\etw-mimalloc.wprp -filemode\n> <my_mimalloc_program>\n> wpr -stop <my_mimalloc_program>.etl\n```\nand then open `<my_mimalloc_program>.etl` in the Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA), or\nuse a tool like [TraceControl] that is specialized for analyzing mimalloc traces.\n\n[ETW]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/event-tracing-for-windows\n[TraceControl]: https://github.com/xinglonghe/TraceControl\n\n\n# Performance\n\nLast update: 2021-01-30\n\nWe tested _mimalloc_ against many other top allocators over a wide\nrange of benchmarks, ranging from various real world programs to\nsynthetic benchmarks that see how the allocator behaves under more\nextreme circumstances. In our benchmark suite, _mimalloc_ outperforms other leading\nallocators (_jemalloc_, _tcmalloc_, _Hoard_, etc), and has a similar memory footprint. A nice property is that it\ndoes consistently well over the wide range of benchmarks.\n\nGeneral memory allocators are interesting as there exists no algorithm that is\noptimal -- for a given allocator one can usually construct a workload\nwhere it does not do so well. The goal is thus to find an allocation\nstrategy that performs well over a wide range of benchmarks without\nsuffering from (too much) underperformance in less common situations.\n\nAs always, interpret these results with care since some benchmarks test synthetic\nor uncommon situations that may never apply to your workloads. For example, most\nallocators do not do well on `xmalloc-testN` but that includes even the best\nindustrial allocators like _jemalloc_ and _tcmalloc_ that are used in some of\nthe world's largest systems (like Chrome or FreeBSD).\n\nAlso, the benchmarks here do not measure the behaviour on very large and long-running server workloads,\nor worst-case latencies of allocation. Much work has gone into `mimalloc` to work well on such\nworkloads (for example, to reduce virtual memory fragmentation on long-running services)\nbut such optimizations are not always reflected in the current benchmark suite.\n\nWe show here only an overview -- for\nmore specific details and further benchmarks we refer to the\n[technical report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mimalloc-free-list-sharding-in-action).\nThe benchmark suite is automated and available separately\nas [mimalloc-bench](https://github.com/daanx/mimalloc-bench).\n\n\n## Benchmark Results on a 16-core AMD 5950x (Zen3)\n\nTesting on the 16-core AMD 5950x processor at 3.4Ghz (4.9Ghz boost), with\nwith 32GiB memory at 3600Mhz, running\tUbuntu 20.04 with glibc 2.31 and GCC 9.3.0.\n\nWe measure three versions of _mimalloc_: the main version `mi` (tag:v1.7.0),\nthe new v2.0 beta version as `xmi` (tag:v2.0.0), and the main version in secure mode as `smi` (tag:v1.7.0).\n\nThe other allocators are\nGoogle's [_tcmalloc_](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) (`tc`, tag:gperftools-2.8.1) used in Chrome,\nFacebook's [_jemalloc_](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc) (`je`, tag:5.2.1) by Jason Evans used in Firefox and FreeBSD,\nthe Intel thread building blocks [allocator](https://github.com/intel/tbb) (`tbb`, tag:v2020.3),\n[rpmalloc](https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc) (`rp`,tag:1.4.1) by Mattias Jansson,\nthe original scalable [_Hoard_](https://github.com/emeryberger/Hoard) (git:d880f72) allocator by Emery Berger \\[1],\nthe memory compacting [_Mesh_](https://github.com/plasma-umass/Mesh) (git:67ff31a) allocator by\nBobby Powers _et al_ \\[8],\nand finally the default system allocator (`glibc`, 2.31) (based on _PtMalloc2_).\n\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2021/bench-amd5950x-2021-01-30-a.svg\"/>\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2021/bench-amd5950x-2021-01-30-b.svg\"/>\n\nAny benchmarks ending in `N` run on all 32 logical cores in parallel.\nResults are averaged over 10 runs and reported relative\nto mimalloc (where 1.2 means it took 1.2&times; longer to run).\nThe legend also contains the _overall relative score_ between the\nallocators where 100 points is the maximum if an allocator is fastest on\nall benchmarks.\n\nThe single threaded _cfrac_ benchmark by Dave Barrett is an implementation of\ncontinued fraction factorization which uses many small short-lived allocations.\nAll allocators do well on such common usage, where _mimalloc_ is just a tad\nfaster than _tcmalloc_ and\n_jemalloc_.\n\nThe _leanN_ program is interesting as a large realistic and\nconcurrent workload of the [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover/lean)\ntheorem prover compiling its own standard library, and there is a 13%\nspeedup over _tcmalloc_. This is\nquite significant: if Lean spends 20% of its time in the\nallocator that means that _mimalloc_ is 1.6&times; faster than _tcmalloc_\nhere. (This is surprising as that is not measured in a pure\nallocation benchmark like _alloc-test_. We conjecture that we see this\noutsized improvement here because _mimalloc_ has better locality in\nthe allocation which improves performance for the *other* computations\nin a program as well).\n\nThe single threaded _redis_ benchmark again show that most allocators do well on such workloads.\n\nThe _larsonN_ server benchmark by Larson and Krishnan \\[2] allocates and frees between threads. They observed this\nbehavior (which they call _bleeding_) in actual server applications, and the benchmark simulates this.\nHere, _mimalloc_ is quite a bit faster than _tcmalloc_ and _jemalloc_ probably due to the object migration between different threads.\n\nThe _mstressN_ workload performs many allocations and re-allocations,\nand migrates objects between threads (as in _larsonN_). However, it also\ncreates  and destroys the _N_ worker threads a few times keeping some objects\nalive beyond the life time of the allocating thread. We observed this\nbehavior in many larger server applications.\n\nThe [_rptestN_](https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc-benchmark) benchmark\nby Mattias Jansson is a allocator test originally designed\nfor _rpmalloc_, and tries to simulate realistic allocation patterns over\nmultiple threads. Here the differences between allocators become more apparent.\n\nThe second benchmark set tests specific aspects of the allocators and\nshows even more extreme differences between them.\n\nThe _alloc-test_, by\n[OLogN Technologies AG](http://ithare.com/testing-memory-allocators-ptmalloc2-tcmalloc-hoard-jemalloc-while-trying-to-simulate-real-world-loads/), is a very allocation intensive benchmark doing millions of\nallocations in various size classes. The test is scaled such that when an\nallocator performs almost identically on _alloc-test1_ as _alloc-testN_ it\nmeans that it scales linearly.\n\nThe _sh6bench_ and _sh8bench_ benchmarks are\ndeveloped by [MicroQuill](http://www.microquill.com/) as part of SmartHeap.\nIn _sh6bench_ _mimalloc_ does much\nbetter than the others (more than 2.5&times; faster than _jemalloc_).\nWe cannot explain this well but believe it is\ncaused in part by the \"reverse\" free-ing pattern in _sh6bench_.\nThe _sh8bench_ is a variation with object migration\nbetween threads; whereas _tcmalloc_ did well on _sh6bench_, the addition of object migration causes it to be 10&times; slower than before.\n\nThe _xmalloc-testN_ benchmark by Lever and Boreham \\[5] and Christian Eder, simulates an asymmetric workload where\nsome threads only allocate, and others only free -- they observed this pattern in\nlarger server applications. Here we see that\nthe _mimalloc_ technique of having non-contended sharded thread free\nlists pays off as it outperforms others by a very large margin. Only _rpmalloc_, _tbb_, and _glibc_ also scale well on this benchmark.\n\nThe _cache-scratch_ benchmark by Emery Berger \\[1], and introduced with\nthe Hoard allocator to test for _passive-false_ sharing of cache lines.\nWith a single thread they all\nperform the same, but when running with multiple threads the potential allocator\ninduced false sharing of the cache lines can cause large run-time differences.\nCrundal \\[6] describes in detail why the false cache line sharing occurs in the _tcmalloc_ design, and also discusses how this\ncan be avoided with some small implementation changes.\nOnly the _tbb_, _rpmalloc_ and _mesh_ allocators also avoid the\ncache line sharing completely, while _Hoard_ and _glibc_ seem to mitigate\nthe effects. Kukanov and Voss \\[7] describe in detail\nhow the design of _tbb_ avoids the false cache line sharing.\n\n\n## On a 36-core Intel Xeon\n\nFor completeness, here are the results on a big Amazon\n[c5.18xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Compute_Optimized) instance\nconsisting of a 2&times;18-core Intel Xeon (Cascade Lake) at 3.4GHz (boost 3.5GHz)\nwith 144GiB ECC memory, running\tUbuntu 20.04 with glibc 2.31, GCC 9.3.0, and\nClang 10.0.0. This time, the mimalloc allocators (mi, xmi, and smi) were\ncompiled with the Clang compiler instead of GCC.\nThe results are similar to the AMD results but it is interesting to\nsee the differences in the _larsonN_, _mstressN_, and _xmalloc-testN_ benchmarks.\n\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2021/bench-c5-18xlarge-2021-01-30-a.svg\"/>\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2021/bench-c5-18xlarge-2021-01-30-b.svg\"/>\n\n\n## Peak Working Set\n\nThe following figure shows the peak working set (rss) of the allocators\non the benchmarks (on the c5.18xlarge instance).\n\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2021/bench-c5-18xlarge-2021-01-30-rss-a.svg\"/>\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2021/bench-c5-18xlarge-2021-01-30-rss-b.svg\"/>\n\nNote that the _xmalloc-testN_ memory usage should be disregarded as it\nallocates more the faster the program runs. Similarly, memory usage of\n_larsonN_, _mstressN_, _rptestN_ and _sh8bench_ can vary depending on scheduling and\nspeed. Nevertheless, we hope to improve the memory usage on _mstressN_\nand _rptestN_ (just as _cfrac_, _larsonN_ and _sh8bench_ have a small working set which skews the results).\n\n<!--\n# Previous Benchmarks\n\nTodo: should we create a separate page for this?\n\n## Benchmark Results on 36-core Intel: 2020-01-20\n\nTesting on a big Amazon EC2 compute instance\n([c5.18xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Compute_Optimized))\nconsisting of a 72 processor Intel Xeon at 3GHz\nwith 144GiB ECC memory, running\tUbuntu 18.04.1 with glibc 2.27 and GCC 7.4.0.\nThe measured allocators are _mimalloc_ (xmi, tag:v1.4.0, page reset enabled)\nand its secure build as _smi_,\nGoogle's [_tcmalloc_](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) (tc, tag:gperftools-2.7) used in Chrome,\nFacebook's [_jemalloc_](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc) (je, tag:5.2.1) by Jason Evans used in Firefox and FreeBSD,\nthe Intel thread building blocks [allocator](https://github.com/intel/tbb) (tbb, tag:2020),\n[rpmalloc](https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc) (rp,tag:1.4.0) by Mattias Jansson,\nthe original scalable [_Hoard_](https://github.com/emeryberger/Hoard) (tag:3.13) allocator by Emery Berger \\[1],\nthe memory compacting [_Mesh_](https://github.com/plasma-umass/Mesh) (git:51222e7) allocator by\nBobby Powers _et al_ \\[8],\nand finally the default system allocator (glibc, 2.27) (based on _PtMalloc2_).\n\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2020/bench-c5-18xlarge-2020-01-20-a.svg\"/>\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2020/bench-c5-18xlarge-2020-01-20-b.svg\"/>\n\nThe following figure shows the peak working set (rss) of the allocators\non the benchmarks (on the c5.18xlarge instance).\n\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2020/bench-c5-18xlarge-2020-01-20-rss-a.svg\"/>\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2020/bench-c5-18xlarge-2020-01-20-rss-b.svg\"/>\n\n\n## On 24-core AMD Epyc, 2020-01-16\n\nFor completeness, here are the results on a\n[r5a.12xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Memory_Optimized) instance\nhaving a 48 processor AMD Epyc 7000 at 2.5GHz with 384GiB of memory.\nThe results are similar to the Intel results but it is interesting to\nsee the differences in the _larsonN_, _mstressN_, and _xmalloc-testN_ benchmarks.\n\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2020/bench-r5a-12xlarge-2020-01-16-a.svg\"/>\n<img width=\"90%\" src=\"doc/bench-2020/bench-r5a-12xlarge-2020-01-16-b.svg\"/>\n\n-->\n\n\n# References\n\n- \\[1] Emery D.
