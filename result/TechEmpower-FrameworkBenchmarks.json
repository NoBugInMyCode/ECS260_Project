Please feel free to ask questions [here](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/2978). We encourage new frameworks and contributors to ask questions. We're here to help!\n\nThis project provides representative performance measures across a wide field of web application frameworks. With much help from the community, coverage is quite broad and we are happy to broaden it further with contributions. The project presently includes frameworks on many languages including `Go`, `Python`, `Java`, `Ruby`, `PHP`, `C#`, `F#`,`Clojure`, `Groovy`, `Dart`, `JavaScript`, `Erlang`, `Haskell`, `Scala`, `Perl`, `Lua`, `C`, and others.  The current tests exercise plaintext responses, JSON serialization, database reads and writes via the object-relational mapper (ORM), collections, sorting, server-side templates, and XSS counter-measures. Future tests will exercise other components and greater computation.\n\n[Read more and see the results of our tests on cloud and physical hardware](http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/). For descriptions of the test types that we run, see the \n[test requirements section](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/wiki/Project-Information-Framework-Tests-Overview).\n\nIf you find yourself in a directory or file that you're not sure what the purpose is, checkout our [file structure](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/wiki/Codebase-File-Structure) in our documentation, which will briefly explain the use of relevant directories and files.\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\nTo get started developing you'll need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) or see our [Quick Start Guide using vagrant](#quick-start-guide-vagrant)\n\n1. Clone TFB.\n\n        $ git clone https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks.git\n\n2. Change directories\n\n        $ cd FrameworkBenchmarks\n\n3. Run a test.\n\n        $ ./tfb --mode verify --test gemini\n\n### Explanation of the `./tfb` script\n\nThe run script is pretty wordy, but each and every flag is required. If you are using windows, either adapt the docker command at the end of the `./tfb` shell script (replacing `${SCRIPT_ROOT}` with `/c/path/to/FrameworkBenchmarks`), or use vagrant.\n\nThe command looks like this: `docker run -it --rm --network tfb -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v [FWROOT]:/FrameworkBenchmarks techempower/tfb [ARGS]`\n\n- `-it` tells docker to run this in 'interactive' mode and simulate a TTY, so that `ctrl+c` is propagated.\n- `--rm` tells docker to remove the container as soon as the toolset finishes running, meaning there aren't hundreds of stopped containers lying around.\n- `--network=tfb` tells the container to join the 'tfb' Docker virtual network\n- The first `-v` specifies which Docker socket path to mount as a volume in the running container. This allows docker commands run inside this container to use the host container's docker to create/run/stop/remove containers.\n- The second `-v` mounts the FrameworkBenchmarks source directory as a volume to share with the container so that rebuilding the toolset image is unnecessary and any changes you make on the host system are available in the running toolset container.\n- `techempower/tfb` is the name of toolset container to run\n\n#### A note on Windows\n\n- Docker expects Linux-style paths. If you cloned on your `C:\\` drive, then `[ABS PATH TO THIS DIR]` would be `/c/FrameworkBenchmarks`.\n- [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) understands `/var/run/docker.sock` even though that is not a valid path on Windows, but only when using Linux containers (it doesn't work with Windows containers and LCOW). [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) **may** not understand `/var/run/docker.sock`, even when using Linux containers - use at your own risk.\n\n## Quick Start Guide (Vagrant)\n\nGet started developing quickly by utilizing vagrant with TFB. [Git](https://git-scm.com),\n[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) are\nrequired.\n\n1. Clone TFB.\n\n        $ git clone https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks.git\n\n2. Change directories\n\n        $ cd FrameworkBenchmarks/deployment/vagrant\n\n3. Build the vagrant virtual machine\n\n        $ vagrant up\n\n4. Run a test\n\n        $ vagrant ssh\n        $ tfb --mode verify --test gemini\n\n## Add a New Test\n\nEither on your computer, or once you open an SSH connection to your vagrant box, start the new test initialization wizard.\n\n        vagrant@TFB-all:~/FrameworkBenchmarks$ ./tfb --new\n\nThis will walk you through the entire process of creating a new test to include in the suite.\n\n## Resources\n\n### Official Documentation\n\nOur official documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/wiki). \nIf you find any errors or areas for improvement within the docs, feel free to open an issue in this repo.\n\n### Live Results\n\nResults of continuous benchmarking runs are available in real time [here](https://tfb-status.techempower.com/).\n\n### Data Visualization\n\nIf you have a `results.json` file that you would like to visualize, you can [do that here](https://tfb-status.techempower.com/share). You can also attach a `runid` parameter to that url where `runid` is a run listed on [tfb-status](https://tfb-status.techempower.com) like so: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&runid=fd07b64e-47ce-411e-8b9b-b13368e988c6.\nIf you want to visualize them or compare different results files on bash, here is an unofficial [plaintext results parser](https://github.com/joeyleeeeeee97/PlainTextResultsParser)\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe community has consistently helped in making these tests better, and we welcome any and all changes. Reviewing our contribution practices and guidelines will help to keep us all on the same page. The [contribution guide](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/wiki/Development-Contributing-Guide) can be found in the [TFB documentation](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/wiki).\n\nJoin in the conversation in the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/discussions), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tfbenchmarks), or chat with us on [Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/) at `#techempower-fwbm`. \n",
