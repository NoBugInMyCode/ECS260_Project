It is a C++ template library of containers, algorithms, and iterators useful for runtime and tool development across multiple platforms. It is a fairly extensive and robust implementation of such a library and has an emphasis on high performance above all other considerations.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you are familiar with the C++ STL or have worked with other templated container/algorithm libraries, you probably don't need to read this. If you have no familiarity with C++ templates at all, then you probably will need more than this document to get you up to speed. In this case, you need to understand that templates, when used properly, are powerful vehicles for the ease of creation of optimized C++ code. A description of C++ templates is outside the scope of this documentation, but there is plenty of such documentation on the Internet.\n\nEASTL is suitable for any tools and shipping applications where the functionality of EASTL is useful. Modern compilers are capable of producing good code with templates and many people are using them in both current generation and future generation applications on multiple platforms from embedded systems to servers and mainframes.\n\n## Package Managers\n\nYou can download and install EASTL using the [Conan](https://github.com/conan-io/conan) package manager:\n\n    conan install eastl/3.15.00@\n\nThe EASTL package in conan is kept up to date by Conan team members and community contributors. If the version is out-of-date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) on the Conan Center Index repository.\n\n\nYou can download and install EASTL using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git\n    cd vcpkg\n    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\n    ./vcpkg integrate install\n    vcpkg install eastl\n\nThe EASTL port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease see [EASTL Introduction](doc/Introduction.md).\n\n\n## Compiling sources\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on compiling and testing the source.\n\n## Credits And Maintainers\n\nEASTL was created by Paul Pedriana and he maintained the project for roughly 10 years.\n\nEASTL was subsequently maintained by Roberto Parolin for more than 8 years.\nHe was the driver and proponent for getting EASTL opensourced.\nRob was a mentor to all members of the team and taught us everything we ever wanted to know about C++ spookyness.\n\nAfter Rob, maintenance of EASTL passed to Max Winkler for roughly a year, until landing with its current maintainer Liam Mitchell.\n\nSignificant EASTL contributions were made by (in alphabetical order):\n\n* Avery Lee\n* Colin Andrews\n* JP Flouret\n* Liam Mitchell\n* Matt Newport\n* Max Winkler\n* Paul Pedriana\n* Roberto Parolin\n* Simon Everett\n\n## Contributors\n\n## Projects And Products Using EASTL\n\n* Frostbite - Electronic Arts - [https://www.ea.com/frostbite]\n\n## License\n\nModified BSD License (3-Clause BSD license) see the file LICENSE in the project root.\n",
