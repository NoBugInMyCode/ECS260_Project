Via `plugins`_, beets becomes a panacea:\n\n- Fetch or calculate all the metadata you could possibly need: `album art`_,\n  `lyrics`_, `genres`_, `tempos`_, `ReplayGain`_ levels, or `acoustic\n  fingerprints`_.\n- Get metadata from `MusicBrainz`_, `Discogs`_, and `Beatport`_. Or guess\n  metadata using songs' filenames or their acoustic fingerprints.\n- `Transcode audio`_ to any format you like.\n- Check your library for `duplicate tracks and albums`_ or for `albums that\n  are missing tracks`_.\n- Clean up crufty tags left behind by other, less-awesome tools.\n- Embed and extract album art from files' metadata.\n- Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in any\n  browser that supports `HTML5 Audio`_.\n- Analyze music files' metadata from the command line.\n- Listen to your library with a music player that speaks the `MPD`_ protocol\n  and works with a staggering variety of interfaces.\n\nIf beets doesn't do what you want yet, `writing your own plugin`_ is\nshockingly simple if you know a little Python.\n\n.. _plugins: https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/\n.. _MPD: https://www.musicpd.org/\n.. _MusicBrainz music collection: https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Collections/\n.. _writing your own plugin:\n    https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/dev/plugins.html\n.. _HTML5 Audio:\n    https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-audio-element\n.. _albums that are missing tracks:\n    https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/missing.html\n.. _duplicate tracks and albums:\n    https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/duplicates.html\n.. _Transcode audio:\n    https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/convert.html\n.. _Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/\n.. _acoustic fingerprints:\n    https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/chroma.html\n.. _ReplayGain: https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/replaygain.html\n.. _tempos: https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/acousticbrainz.html\n.. _genres: https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/lastgenre.html\n.. _album art: https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/fetchart.html\n.. _lyrics: https://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/lyrics.html\n.. _MusicBrainz: https://musicbrainz.org/\n.. _Beatport: https://www.beatport.com\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nYou can install beets by typing ``pip install beets`` or directly from Github (see details `here`_).\nBeets has also been packaged in the `software repositories`_ of several\ndistributions.
