        "readme": "# Reachability.swift\n\nReachability.swift is a replacement for Apple's Reachability sample, re-written in Swift with closures.\n\nIt is compatible with **iOS** (8.0 - 12.0), **OSX** (10.9 - 10.14) and **tvOS** (9.0 - 12.0)\n\nInspired by https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability\n\n## Supporting **Reachability.swift**\nKeeping **Reachability.swift** up-to-date is a time consuming task. Making updates, reviewing pull requests, responding to issues and answering emails all take time. \n\nPlease consider sponsoring me https://github.com/sponsors/ashleymills, it's a great way to say thanks!\n\nIf you're an iOS developer who's looking for a quick and easy way to create App Store screenshots, please try out my app [Screenshot Producer](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1252374855?pt=215893&ct=reachability&mt=8)\u2026\n\n Devices\u00a0| Layout | Copy | Localize | Export \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:\n![](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/64/af/55/64af55bc-2ef0-691c-f5f3-4963685f7f63/source/552x414bb.jpg) |  ![](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/fb/4c/bd/fb4cbd2f-dd04-22ba-4fdf-5ac652693fb8/source/552x414bb.jpg) |  ![](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/5a/4f/cf/5a4fcfdf-ca04-0307-9f2e-83178e8ad90d/source/552x414bb.jpg) |  ![](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/17/ea/56/17ea562e-e045-96e7-fcac-cfaaf4f499fd/source/552x414bb.jpg) |  ![](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/59/9e/dd/599edd50-f05c-f413-8e88-e614731fd828/source/552x414bb.jpg)\n\nAnd don't forget to **\u2605** the repo. This increases its visibility and encourages others to contribute.\n\nThanks\nAsh\n\n\n## Got a problem?\n\nPlease read https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md before raising an issue.\n\n## Installation\n### Manual\nJust drop the **Reachability.swift** file into your project. That's it!\n\n### CocoaPods\n[CocoaPods][] is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. To install Reachability.swift with CocoaPods:\n\n 1. Make sure CocoaPods is [installed][CocoaPods Installation].\n\n 2. Update your Podfile to include the following:\n\n    ``` ruby\n    use_frameworks!\n    pod 'ReachabilitySwift'\n    ```\n\n 3. Run `pod install`.\n\n[CocoaPods]: https://cocoapods.org\n[CocoaPods Installation]: https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started\n \n 4. In your code import Reachability like so:\n   `import Reachability`\n\n### Carthage\n[Carthage][] is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.\nTo install Reachability.swift with Carthage:\n\n1. Install Carthage via [Homebrew][]\n  ```bash\n  $ brew update\n  $ brew install carthage\n  ```\n\n2. Add `github \"ashleymills/Reachability.swift\"` to your Cartfile.\n\n3. Run `carthage update`.\n\n4. Drag `Reachability.framework` from the `Carthage/Build/iOS/` directory to the `Linked Frameworks and Libraries` section of your Xcode project\u2019s `General` settings.\n\n5. Add `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Reachability.framework` to `Input Files` of Run Script Phase for Carthage.\n\n6. In your code import Reachability like so:\n`import Reachability`\n\n\n[Carthage]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage\n[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh\n[Photo Flipper]: https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id749627884?pt=215893&ct=GitHubReachability&mt=8\n\n### Swift Package Manager (SPM)\nThe Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager from xcode :\n\n1. File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency...\n\n2. Enter package URL : https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift, choose the latest release\n\n## Example - closures\n\nNOTE: All closures are run on the **main queue**.\n\n```swift\n//declare this property where it won't go out of scope relative to your listener\nlet reachability = try! Reachability()\n\nreachability.whenReachable = { reachability in\n    if reachability.connection == .wifi {\n        print(\"Reachable via WiFi\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"Reachable via Cellular\")\n    }\n}\nreachability.whenUnreachable = { _ in\n    print(\"Not reachable\")\n}\n\ndo {\n    try reachability.startNotifier()\n} catch {\n    print(\"Unable to start notifier\")\n}\n```\n\nand for stopping notifications\n\n```swift\nreachability.stopNotifier()\n```\n\n## Example - notifications\n\nNOTE: All notifications are delivered on the **main queue**.\n\n```swift\n//declare this property where it won't go out of scope relative to your listener\nlet reachability = try! Reachability()\n\n//declare this inside of viewWillAppear\n\n     NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(reachabilityChanged(note:)), name: .reachabilityChanged, object: reachability)\n    do{\n      try reachability.startNotifier()\n    }catch{\n      print(\"could not start reachability notifier\")\n    }\n```\n\nand\n\n```swift\n@objc func reachabilityChanged(note: Notification) {\n\n  let reachability = note.object as! Reachability\n\n  switch reachability.connection {\n  case .wifi:\n      print(\"Reachable via WiFi\")\n  case .cellular:\n      print(\"Reachable via Cellular\")\n  case .unavailable:\n    print(\"Network not reachable\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nand for stopping notifications\n\n```swift\nreachability.stopNotifier()\nNotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self, name: .reachabilityChanged, object: reachability)\n```\n\n## Want to help?\n\nGot a bug fix, or a new feature? Create a pull request and go for it!\n\n## Let me know!\n\nIf you use **Reachability.swift**, please let me know about your app and I'll put a link [here\u2026](https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift/wiki/Apps-using-Reachability.swift) and tell your friends!\n\nCheers,\nAsh\n",
