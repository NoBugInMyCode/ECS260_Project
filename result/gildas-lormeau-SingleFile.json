SingleFile is a Web Extension (and a CLI tool) compatible with Chrome, Firefox\r\n(Desktop and Mobile), Microsoft Edge, Safari, Vivaldi, Brave, Waterfox, Yandex\r\nbrowser, and Opera.\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n\r\n- [SingleFile](#singlefile)\r\n  - [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\r\n  - [Demo](#demo)\r\n  - [Install](#install)\r\n  - [Getting started](#getting-started)\r\n  - [Additional notes](#additional-notes)\r\n  - [FAQ](#faq)\r\n  - [Release notes](#release-notes)\r\n  - [Known Issues](#known-issues)\r\n  - [Troubleshooting unknown issues](#troubleshooting-unknown-issues)\r\n  - [Command Line Interface (SingleFile CLI)](#command-line-interface-singlefile-cli)\r\n  - [Integration with user scripts](#integration-with-user-scripts)\r\n  - [File format comparison](#file-format-comparison)\r\n  - [Projects using/compatible with SingleFile](#projects-usingcompatible-with-singlefile)\r\n  - [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy)\r\n  - [Contributors](#contributors)\r\n  - [Code derived from third party projects](#code-derived-from-third-party-projects)\r\n  - [Icons](#icons)\r\n  - [License](#license)\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/396787/156664907-cc458e35-f41b-45ca-91eb-372213812b44.mp4\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nSingleFile can be installed from the store of:\r\n\r\n- Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/single-file\r\n- Firefox for Android:\r\n  https://addons.mozilla.org/android/addon/single-file\r\n- Chrome:\r\n  https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle\r\n- Safari (macOS and iOS): https://apps.apple.com/us/app/singlefile-for-safari/id6444322545\r\n- Microsoft Edge:\r\n  https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/efnbkdcfmcmnhlkaijjjmhjjgladedno\r\n\r\nYou can also download the zip file\r\n(https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/archive/master.zip) of the project\r\nand install it manually by unzipping it somewhere on your disk and following\r\nthese instructions:\r\n\r\n- Firefox: https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox\r\n- Chrome and Microsoft Edge: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile-MV3\r\n- Safari: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile-Safari-Extension\r\n  \r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n- Click on the SingleFile button in the extension toolbar to save the page.\r\n- You can click again on the button to cancel the action when processing a page.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes\r\n\r\n- Open the context menu by right-clicking the SingleFile button in the extension\r\n  toolbar or on the webpage. It allows you to save:\r\n  - the current tab,\r\n  - the selected content,\r\n  - the selected frame.\r\n- You can also process multiple tabs in one click and save:\r\n  - the selected tabs,\r\n  - the unpinned tabs,\r\n  - all the tabs.\r\n- Select \"Annotate and save the page...\" in the context menu to:\r\n  - highlight text,\r\n  - add notes,\r\n  - remove content.\r\n- The context menu also allows you to activate the auto-save of:\r\n  - the current tab,\r\n  - the unpinned tabs,\r\n  - all the tabs.\r\n- With auto-save active, pages are automatically saved every time after being\r\n  loaded (or before being unloaded if not).\r\n- Right-click on the SingleFile button and select \"Manage extension\" (Firefox) /\r\n  \"Options\" (Chrome) to open the options page.\r\n- Enable the option \"Destination > save to Google Drive\" or \"Destination >\r\n  upload to GitHub\" to upload pages to Google Drive or GitHub respectively.\r\n- Enable the option \"Misc. > add proof of existence\" to prove the existence of\r\n  saved pages by linking the SHA256 of the pages into the blockchain.\r\n- You can use the customizable shortkey Ctrl+Shift+Y to save the current tab or\r\n  the selected tabs. Go to about:addons and select \"Manage extension shortcuts\"\r\n  in the cogwheel menu to change it in Firefox. Go to\r\n  chrome://extensions/shortcuts to change it in Chrome.\r\n- The default save folder is the download folder configured in your browser, cf.\r\n  about:addons in Firefox and chrome://settings in Chrome.\r\n- See the extension help in the options page for more detailed information about\r\n  the options and technical notes.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/blob/master/faq.md\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\n\r\nSee https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/single-file/versions/\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n- All browsers:\r\n  - For security reasons, you cannot save pages hosted on\r\n    https://chrome.google.com, https://addons.mozilla.org and some other Mozilla\r\n    domains. When this happens, \ud83d\udec7 is displayed on top of the SingleFile icon.\r\n  - For\r\n    [security reasons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image),\r\n    SingleFile is sometimes unable to save the image representation of\r\n    [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) and\r\n    snapshots of\r\n    [video](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) elements.\r\n  - The last saved path cannot be remembered by default. To circumvent this\r\n    limitation, disable the option \"Misc > save pages in background\".\r\n  - The following characters are replaced by their full-width equivalent \r\n    symbols in file names: ~, +, ?, %, *, :, |, \", &lt;, &gt;, \\. The \r\n    replacement characters are respectively: \uff5e, \uff0b, \uff1f, \uff05, \uff0a, \uff1a, \uff5c, \uff02, \uff1c, \uff1e, \uff3c.\r\n    Other invalid charcaters are replaced by _. This is done to maintain \r\n    compatibility with various OSs and file systems. If you don't need that \r\n    level of compatibility and know what you are doing, you can change the\r\n    list of forbidden characters and the replacement characters in the Hidden \r\n    options(https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/wiki/Hidden-options).\r\n- Chromium-based browsers:\r\n  - You must enable the option \"Allow access to file URLs\" in the extension page\r\n    to display the infobar when viewing a saved page, and to save or to annotate\r\n    a page stored on the filesystem.\r\n  - If the file name of a saved page looks like\r\n    \"56833935-156b-4d8c-a00f-19599c6513d3.html\", disable the option \"Misc > save\r\n    pages in background\". Reinstalling the browser may also fix this issue. You\r\n    can find more info about this bug\r\n    [here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=892133).\r\n  - Disabling the option \"File name > open the \"Save as\" dialog to confirm the\r\n    file name\" will work if and only if the option \"Ask where to save each file\r\n    before downloading\" is disabled in chrome://settings/downloads.\r\n- Firefox:\r\n  - The \"File name > file name conflict resolution\" option does not work if set\r\n    to \"prompt for a name\"\r\n  - Sometimes, SingleFile is unable to save the contents of sandboxed iframes\r\n    because of [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1411641).\r\n  - When processing a page from the filesystem, external resources (e.g. images,\r\n    stylesheets, fonts etc.) will not be embedded into the saved page. You can\r\n    find more info about this bug\r\n    [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1644488). This bug has\r\n    been closed by Mozilla as \"WontFix\". But there is a simple workaround\r\n    proposed\r\n    [here](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/issues/7#issuecomment-618980153).\r\n- Waterfox Classic\r\n  - User interface elements displayed in the page (progress bar, logs panel)\r\n    won't be displayed unless `dom.webcomponents.enabled` is enabled in\r\n    `about:config`.\r\n  - When opening pages saved with the option \"Images > group duplicate images\r\n    together\" enabled, some duplicate images might not displayed. It is\r\n    recommended to disable this option.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting unknown issues\r\n\r\nPlease follow these steps if you find an unknown issue:\r\n\r\n- Save the page in incognito.\r\n- If saving page in incognito did not fix the issue, reset SingleFile options.\r\n- If resetting options did not fix the issue, restart the browser.\r\n- If restarting the browser did not fix the issue, try to disable all other\r\n  extensions to see if there is a conflict.\r\n- If there is a conflict then try to determine against which extension(s).\r\n- Please report the issue with a short description on how to reproduce it here:\r\n  https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/issues.\r\n\r\n## Command Line Interface (SingleFile CLI)\r\n\r\nYou can save web pages to HTML from the command line interface. See here for\r\nmore info: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/single-file-cli.\r\n\r\n## Integration with user scripts\r\n\r\nYou can execute a user script just before (and after) SingleFile saves a page.\r\nFor more info, see\r\nhttps://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/wiki/How-to-execute-a-user-script-before-a-page-is-saved.\r\n\r\n## File format comparison\r\n\r\n|   \t                                                                          |        HTML        | Self-extracting ZIP | MHTML | Webarchive (Safari) | HTML+folder |\r\n| ---                                \t                                          |       :---:        |        :---:        | :---: |         :---:       |    :---:    |\r\n| Pages are saved as a single file                                              | \u2713 \t               | \u2713 \t                 | \u2713     | \u2713                   |             |\r\n| HTML and styles are minified                                                  | \u2713                  | \u2713 \t                 |       |    \t               |             |\r\n| Unused HTML and styles are removed from files                                 | \u2713                  | \u2713 \t                 |       |                     |   \t         |\r\n| Binary resources are not encoded in base 64                                   |                    | \u2713 \t                 |       | \u2713                   | \u2713 \t         |\r\n| Files are compressed                                                          |                    | \u2713 \t                 |       |                     |   \t         |\r\n| Files can be viewed without installing any extension                          | \u2713                  | \u2713\u00b9                  | \u2713\u00b2    | \u2713\u00b3                  | \u2713           |\r\n| Files can be viewed without running JavaScript                                | \u2713                  |         \t           | \u2713     | \u2713                   | \u2713 \t         |\r\n| Files can be unzipped to extract page resources                               |                    | \u2713 \t                 |       |                     | n/a         |\r\n| Files contains the text of the page (plain or formatted) which can be indexed | \u2713 \t               | \u2713\u2074                  | \u2713     | \u2713 \t                 | \u2713 \t         |\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n\u00b9 When using the \"universal\" self-extracting file format\r\n\r\n\u00b2 Only in Chromium-based browsers, and Internet Explorer\r\n\r\n\u00b3 Only in Safari\r\n\r\n\u2074 An option must be enabled in the extension\r\n\r\n## Projects using/compatible with SingleFile\r\n\r\n- ArchiveBox - Open-source self-hosted web archiving:\r\n  https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox\r\n- htmls-to-datasette - Tool to index HTML files into a Sqlite database:\r\n  https://github.com/pjamar/htmls-to-datasette\r\n- linkding - Bookmark manager that you can host yourself.
