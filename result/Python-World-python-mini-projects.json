This button will show you the URL to run.\r\n    <br><img src=\"https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/code-button.png\" title=\"Code button\" width=\"400\"/>\r\n\r\n    For example, run this command inside your terminal:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/python-mini-projects.git\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **Replace \\<your-github-username\\>!**\r\n\r\n    Learn more about [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).\r\n- Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid merge conflicts:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects.git\r\n    git fetch upstream\r\n    git pull upstream master\r\n    git push\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    Alternatively, GitHub also provides syncing now - click \"Fetch upstream\" at the top of your repo below \"Code\" button.\r\n\r\n- If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can try this one by [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/git-merge-conflict).\r\n\r\n- Checkout to development branch (*name your branch according to the issue name*).\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    git checkout -b <branch-name>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Create a folder in\r\n  [projects directory](https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/tree/master/projects)\r\n  according to issue name.\r\n- Write your code and add to the respective folder in the projects directory, locally.\r\n- Don't forget to add a `README.md` in your folder, according to the\r\n   [README_TEMPLATE.](https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md)\r\n- Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` ([write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), if possible):\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    git add -A\r\n    git commit -m \"<your message>\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Push the code _to your repository_.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    git push origin <branch-name>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and **make a pull request**:\r\n\r\n    ![pull request image](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/choose-base-and-compare-branches.png)\r\n\r\n    Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).\r\n- Now wait, until one of us *reviews your Pull Request*! If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.\r\n\r\n## README Template for scripts\r\n\r\n[README
