It does not require Rails but will integrate tightly with\nRails to make background processing dead simple.\n\n\nRequirements\n-----------------\n\n- Redis: Redis 7.2+, Valkey 7.2+ or Dragonfly 1.13+\n- Ruby: MRI 3.2+ or JRuby 9.4+.\n\nSidekiq 8.0 supports Rails 7.0+ but does not require it.\n\nSidekiq supports [Valkey](https://valkey.io) and [Dragonfly](https://www.dragonflydb.io) as Redis alternatives but\nRedis 7.2.4 is considered to be the canonical implementation.\nIncompatibilities with that version are considered bugs.\n\nInstallation\n-----------------\n\n    bundle add sidekiq\n\n\nGetting Started\n-----------------\n\nSee the [Getting Started wiki page](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Getting-Started) and follow the simple setup process.\nYou can watch [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjeHh2LSCFrWGT5uVjUuFKAcrcj5kSai1) to learn all about\nSidekiq and see its features in action.  Here's the Web UI:\n\n![Web UI](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/raw/main/examples/web-ui.png)\n\nPerformance\n---------------\n\nThe benchmark in `bin/sidekiqload` creates 500,000 no-op jobs and drains them as fast as possible, assuming a fixed Redis network latency of 1ms.\nThis requires a lot of Redis network I/O and JSON parsing.\nThis benchmark is IO-bound so we increase the concurrency to 25.\nIf your application is sending lots of emails or performing other network-intensive work, you could see a similar benefit but be careful not to saturate the CPU.\n\nVersion | Time to process 500k jobs | Throughput (jobs/sec) | Ruby | Concurrency | Job Type\n-----------------|------|---------|---------|------------------------|---\nSidekiq 7.0.3 | 21.3 sec| 23,500 | 3.2.0+yjit | 30 | Sidekiq::Job\nSidekiq 7.0.3 | 33.8 sec| 14,700 | 3.2.0+yjit | 30 | ActiveJob 7.0.4\nSidekiq 7.0.3 | 23.5 sec| 21,300 | 3.2.0 | 30 | Sidekiq::Job\nSidekiq 7.0.3 | 46.5 sec| 10,700 | 3.2.0 | 30 | ActiveJob 7.0.4\nSidekiq 7.0.3 | 23.0 sec| 21,700 | 2.7.5 | 30 | Sidekiq::Job\nSidekiq 7.0.3 | 46.5 sec| 10,850 | 2.7.5 | 30 | ActiveJob 7.0.4\n\nMost of Sidekiq's overhead is Redis network I/O.\nActiveJob adds a notable amount of CPU overhead due to argument deserialization and callbacks.\nConcurrency of 30 was determined experimentally to maximize one CPU without saturating it.\n\nWant to Upgrade?\n-------------------\n\nUse `bundle up sidekiq` to upgrade Sidekiq and all its dependencies.\nUpgrade notes between each major version can be found in the `docs/` directory.\n\nI also sell Sidekiq Pro and Sidekiq Enterprise, extensions to Sidekiq which provide more\nfeatures, a commercial-friendly license and allow you to support high\nquality open source development all at the same time.  Please see the\n[Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) homepage for more detail.\n\n\nProblems?\n-----------------\n\n**Please do not directly email any Sidekiq committers with questions or problems.**\nA community is best served when discussions are held in public.\n\nIf you have a problem, please review the [FAQ](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/FAQ) and [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Problems-and-Troubleshooting) wiki pages.\nSearching the [issues](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues) for your problem is also a good idea.\n\nSidekiq Pro and Sidekiq Enterprise customers get private email support.\nYou can purchase at https://sidekiq.org; email support@contribsys.com for help.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n* Product documentation is in the [wiki](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki).\n* Occasional announcements are made to the [@sidekiq](https://ruby.social/@sidekiq) Mastodon account.\n* The [Sidekiq tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sidekiq) on Stack Overflow has lots of useful Q &amp; A.\n\nEvery Thursday morning is Sidekiq office hour: I video chat and answer questions.\nSee the [Sidekiq support page](https://sidekiq.org/support.html) for details.\n\nContributing\n-----------------\n\nPlease see [the contributing guidelines](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/.github/contributing.md).\n\nLicense\n-----------------\n\nPlease see [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) for licensing details.\nThe license for Sidekiq Pro and Sidekiq Enterprise can be found in [COMM-LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/COMM-LICENSE.txt).\n\nAuthor\n-----------------\n\nMike Perham, [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mike.contribsys.com) / [mastodon](https://ruby.social/@getajobmike), [https://www.mikeperham.com](https://www.mikeperham.com) / [https://www.contribsys.com](https://www.contribsys.com)\n",
