While some of our \nimplementations are as fast as (or faster than) their counterparts in <tt>java.util</tt>,\nour main goal is to express the core algorithmic ideas in an elegant and simple manner.\nWhile we embrace some advanced Java features (such as generics and iterators),\nwe avoid those that interfere with the exposition (such as inheritance and concurrency).\n\n## Build managers\n\nThis repository is intended for use with either the <a href = \"https://maven.apache.org\">Maven</a>\nor <a href = \"https://gradle.org\">Gradle</a> build managers.\nIt can be run from either the command line or integrated into\nEclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ.\nYou can also access it via <a href = \"https://bintray.com/algs4/maven/algs4\">Bintray</a>.\n\n## Coursera Algorithms, Part I and II students\n\nFeel free to use this public repository to develop solutions to the programming assignments.\nHowever, please do not store solutions to programming assignments in public repositories.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright &copy; 2000&ndash;2023 by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.\n\n## License\n\nThis code is released under GPLv3.\n\n## Contribute to this repository\n\nThis <a href = \"http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/wishlist.txt\">wishlist.txt</a>\ncontains a list of algorithms and data structures that we would\nlike to add to the repository. Indeed, several of the algorithms and\ndata structures in this repository were contributed by others. If interested, please\nfollow the same style as the code in the repository and thoroughly test your\ncode before contacting us.\n\n## Support for other programming languages\n\nSome of the code in this repository has been translated to other languages:\n<ul>\n<li><a href = \"https://github.com/garyaiki/Scala-Algorithms\">Scala</a> by Gary Struthers\n<li><a href = \"https://github.com/nguyenqthai/Algs4Net\">.NET</a> by Quoc Thai\n<li><a href = \"https://github.com/itu-algorithms/itu.algs4\">Python</a> by ITU Copenhagen\n<li><a href = \"https://github.com/shellfly/algs4-py\">Python</a> by Li Hao\n<li><a href = \"https://github.com/shellfly/algo\">Go</a> by Li Hao\n</ul>\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to Peter Korgan for Maven and Gradle support.\n",
