This build has the latest code from our `main` branch, giving you an opportunity to try features before they make it to Windows Terminal Preview.\n\nWindows Terminal Canary is our least stable offering, so you may discover bugs before we have had a chance to find them.\n\nWindows Terminal Canary is available as an App Installer distribution and a Portable ZIP distribution.\n\nThe App Installer distribution supports automatic updates. Due to platform limitations, this installer only works on Windows 11.\n\nThe Portable ZIP distribution is a portable application. It will not automatically update and will not automatically check for updates. This portable ZIP distribution works on Windows 10 (19041+) and Windows 11.\n\n| Distribution  | Architecture    | Link                                                 |\n|---------------|:---------------:|------------------------------------------------------|\n| App Installer | x64, arm64, x86 | [download](https://aka.ms/terminal-canary-installer) |\n| Portable ZIP  | x64             | [download](https://aka.ms/terminal-canary-zip-x64)   |\n| Portable ZIP  | ARM64           | [download](https://aka.ms/terminal-canary-zip-arm64) |\n| Portable ZIP  | x86             | [download](https://aka.ms/terminal-canary-zip-x86)   |\n\n_Learn more about the [types of Windows Terminal distributions](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/terminal/distributions)._\n\n---\n\n## Windows Terminal Roadmap\n\nThe plan for the Windows Terminal [is described here](/doc/roadmap-2023.md) and\nwill be updated as the project proceeds.\n\n## Terminal & Console Overview\n\nPlease take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the\ncode:\n\n### Windows Terminal\n\nWindows Terminal is a new, modern, feature-rich, productive terminal application\nfor command-line users. It includes many of the features most frequently\nrequested by the Windows command-line community including support for tabs, rich\ntext, globalization, configurability, theming & styling, and more.\n\nThe Terminal will also need to meet our goals and measures to ensure it remains\nfast and efficient, and doesn't consume vast amounts of memory or power.\n\n### The Windows Console Host\n\nThe Windows Console host, `conhost.exe`, is Windows' original command-line user\nexperience. It also hosts Windows' command-line infrastructure and the Windows\nConsole API server, input engine, rendering engine, user preferences, etc. The\nconsole host code in this repository is the actual source from which the\n`conhost.exe` in Windows itself is built.\n\nSince taking ownership of the Windows command-line in 2014, the team added\nseveral new features to the Console, including background transparency,\nline-based selection, support for [ANSI / Virtual Terminal\nsequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code), [24-bit\ncolor](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/24-bit-color-in-the-windows-console/),\na [Pseudoconsole\n(\"ConPTY\")](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/),\nand more.\n\nHowever, because Windows Console's primary goal is to maintain backward\ncompatibility, we have been unable to add many of the features the community\n(and the team) have been wanting for the last several years including tabs,\nunicode text, and emoji.\n\nThese limitations led us to create the new Windows Terminal.\n\n> You can read more about the evolution of the command-line in general, and the\n> Windows command-line specifically in [this accompanying series of blog\n> posts](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-backgrounder/)\n> on the Command-Line team's blog.\n\n### Shared Components\n\nWhile overhauling Windows Console, we modernized its codebase considerably,\ncleanly separating logical entities into modules and classes, introduced some\nkey extensibility points, replaced several old, home-grown collections and\ncontainers with safer, more efficient [STL\ncontainers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/stl-containers?view=vs-2022),\nand made the code simpler and safer by using Microsoft's [Windows Implementation\nLibraries - WIL](https://github.com/Microsoft/wil).\n\nThis overhaul resulted in several of Console's key components being available\nfor re-use in any terminal implementation on Windows. These components include a\nnew DirectWrite-based text layout and rendering engine, a text buffer capable of\nstoring both UTF-16 and UTF-8, a VT parser/emitter, and more.\n\n### Creating the new Windows Terminal\n\nWhen we started planning the new Windows Terminal application, we explored and\nevaluated several approaches and technology stacks. We ultimately decided that\nour goals would be best met by continuing our investment in our C++ codebase,\nwhich would allow us to reuse several of the aforementioned modernized\ncomponents in both the existing Console and the new Terminal. Further, we\nrealized that this would allow us to build much of the Terminal's core itself as\na reusable UI control that others can incorporate into their own applications.\n\nThe result of this work is contained within this repo and delivered as the\nWindows Terminal application you can download from the Microsoft Store, or\n[directly from this repo's\nreleases](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases).\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nFor more information about Windows Terminal, you may find some of these\nresources useful and interesting:\n\n* [Command-Line Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline)\n* [Command-Line Backgrounder Blog\n  Series](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-backgrounder/)\n* Windows Terminal Launch: [Terminal \"Sizzle\n  Video\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gw0rXPMMPE&list=PLEHMQNlPj-Jzh9DkNpqipDGCZZuOwrQwR&index=2&t=0s)\n* Windows Terminal Launch: [Build 2019\n  Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMudkRcwjCw)\n* Run As Radio: [Show 645 - Windows Terminal with Richard\n  Turner](https://www.runasradio.com/Shows/Show/645)\n* Azure Devops Podcast: [Episode 54 - Kayla Cinnamon and Rich Turner on DevOps\n  on the Windows\n  Terminal](http://azuredevopspodcast.clear-measure.com/kayla-cinnamon-and-rich-turner-on-devops-on-the-windows-terminal-team-episode-54)\n* Microsoft Ignite 2019 Session: [The Modern Windows Command Line: Windows\n  Terminal -\n  BRK3321](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/81329?source=sessions)\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n### I built and ran the new Terminal, but it looks just like the old console\n\nCause: You're launching the incorrect solution in Visual Studio.\n\nSolution: Make sure you're building & deploying the `CascadiaPackage` project in\nVisual Studio.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> `OpenConsole.exe` is just a locally-built `conhost.exe`, the classic\n> Windows Console that hosts Windows' command-line infrastructure. OpenConsole\n> is used by Windows Terminal to connect to and communicate with command-line\n> applications (via\n> [ConPty](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/)).\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\nAll project documentation is located at [aka.ms/terminal-docs](https://aka.ms/terminal-docs).

Note: Opening\n  the solution in VS 2022 will [prompt you to install missing components\n  automatically](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/setup/configure-visual-studio-across-your-organization-with-vsconfig/):\n  * Desktop Development with C++\n  * Universal Windows Platform Development\n  * **The following Individual Components**\n    * C++ (v143) Universal Windows Platform Tools\n* You must install the [.NET Framework Targeting Pack](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/install/guide-for-developers#to-install-the-net-framework-developer-pack-or-targeting-pack) to build test projects\n\n## Building the Code\n\nOpenConsole.sln may be built from within Visual Studio or from the command-line\nusing a set of convenience scripts & tools in the **/tools** directory:\n\n### Building in PowerShell\n\n```powershell\nImport-Module .\\tools\\OpenConsole.psm1\nSet-MsBuildDevEnvironment\nInvoke-OpenConsoleBuild\n```\n\n### Building in Cmd\n\n```shell\n.\\tools\\razzle.cmd\nbcz\n```\n\n## Running & Debugging\n\nTo debug the Windows Terminal in VS, right click on `CascadiaPackage` (in the\nSolution Explorer) and go to properties. In the Debug menu, change \"Application\nprocess\" and \"Background task process\" to \"Native Only\".\n\nYou should then be able to build & debug the Terminal project by hitting\n<kbd>F5</kbd>. Make sure to select either the \"x64\" or the \"x86\" platform - the\nTerminal doesn't build for \"Any Cpu\" (because the Terminal is a C++ application,\nnot a C# one).\n\n> \ud83d\udc49 You will _not_ be able to launch the Terminal directly by running the\n> WindowsTerminal.exe. For more details on why, see\n> [#926](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/926),\n> [#4043](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/4043)\n\n### Coding Guidance\n\nPlease review these brief docs below about our coding practices.\n\n> \ud83d\udc49 If you find something missing from these docs, feel free to contribute to\n> any of our documentation files anywhere in the repository (or write some new\n> ones!)\n\nThis is a work in progress as we learn what we'll need to provide people in\norder to be effective contributors to our project.\n\n* [Coding Style](./doc/STYLE.md)\n* [Code Organization](./doc/ORGANIZATION.md)\n* [Exceptions in our legacy codebase](./doc/EXCEPTIONS.md)\n* [Helpful smart pointers and macros for interfacing with Windows in WIL](./doc/WIL.md)\n\n---\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of\nConduct][conduct-code].
