Thus you may have seen small referred to as 117M and medium referred to as 345M.*\n\n## Usage\n\nThis repository is meant to be a starting point for researchers and engineers to experiment with GPT-2.\n\nFor basic information, see our [model card](./model_card.md).\n\n### Some caveats\n\n- GPT-2 models' robustness and worst case behaviors are not well-understood.  As with any machine-learned model, carefully evaluate GPT-2 for your use case, especially if used without fine-tuning or in safety-critical applications where reliability is important.\n- The dataset our GPT-2 models were trained on contains many texts with [biases](https://twitter.com/TomerUllman/status/1101485289720242177) and factual inaccuracies, and thus GPT-2 models are likely to be biased and inaccurate as well.\n- To avoid having samples mistaken as human-written, we recommend clearly labeling samples as synthetic before wide dissemination.  Our models are often incoherent or inaccurate in subtle ways, which takes more than a quick read for a human to notice.\n\n### Work with us\n\nPlease [let us know](mailto:languagequestions@openai.com) if you\u2019re doing interesting research with or working on applications of GPT-2!  We\u2019re especially interested in hearing from and potentially working with those who are studying\n- Potential malicious use cases and defenses against them (e.g. the detectability of synthetic text)\n- The extent of problematic content (e.g. bias) being baked into the models and effective mitigations\n\n## Development\n\nSee [DEVELOPERS.md](./DEVELOPERS.md)\n\n## Contributors\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTORS.md](./CONTRIBUTORS.md)\n\n## Citation\n\nPlease use the following bibtex entry:\n```\n@article{radford2019language,\n  title={Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners},\n  author={Radford, Alec and Wu, Jeff and Child, Rewon and Luan, David and Amodei, Dario and Sutskever, Ilya},\n  year={2019}\n}\n```\n\n## Future work\n\nWe may release code for evaluating the models on various benchmarks.\n\nWe are still considering release of the larger models.\n\n## License\n\n[Modified MIT](./LICENSE)\n",
