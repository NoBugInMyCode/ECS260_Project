Here it is.\n\n[See live preview](http://leemunroe.github.io/responsive-html-email-template/email.html).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/leemunroe/responsive-html-email-template/assets/15963/29595188-d4f3-4236-877d-6488c159140d\" alt=\"Simple HTML Email Template\" width=\"500\">\n\n## Inline your CSS before sending\n\nEmail is notorious for inconsistent CSS support. Therefore you should always inline your CSS and send a test to yourself before sending.\n\n### Sending emails directly from your codebase or using a developer service?\n\nFor an API service (like Mailgun, SendGrid, Postmark) **you need to inline the CSS before sending**. See `email-inlined.html` for an example.\n\nYou can use this [Email CSS Inliner](https://htmlemail.io/inline/) and then [send a test email to yourself](https://postdrop.io) to verify it works as expected. \n\n* Copy all of email.html\n* Paste the HTML as the source into the inliner\n* Copy the HTML output and use this as the email template you send\n\n### Sending emails using a marketing service like Mailchimp?\n\nUse the template `email.html` as is. They'll put the CSS inline for you when you put together your campaign.\n\n## Images in email\n\nWhen inserting images remember to include the following attributes or risk them breaking in different clients:\n\n* `src`\n* `alt`\n* `width`\n* `height`\n* `border`\n\nExample:\n\n`<img src=\"https://absolute-path-to-image.jpg\" alt=\"Useful alt text\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" style=\"border:0; outline:none; text-decoration:none; display:block;\">`\n\n[More information here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/introduction-building-sending-html-email-for-web-developers/)\n\n## Tried and tested on all major email clients\n\nTested on mobile, desktop and web.\n\n<img width=\"1424\" alt=\"Tested on Email Clients\" src=\"https://github.com/leemunroe/responsive-html-email-template/assets/15963/a5920027-f27d-41aa-bcbe-a3693f9d3277\">\n\n## More HTML email resources\n\n* [10 Premium HTML Email Templates for Developers](https://htmlemail.io)\n* [Free Figma Email Template Design System](https://htmlemail.io/design-system)\n* [An Introduction To Building And Sending HTML Email](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/introduction-building-sending-html-email-for-web-developers/)\n* [Grunt Email Design Workflow](https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-design)\n* [Everything Web Developers Need To Know About Transactional Email](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/everything-developers-need-to-know-about-sending-transactional-email--cms-31759)\n* [Manage and Send Email Templates To Yourself](https://postdrop.io)\n* [Accessible Email Evaluation Tool](https://www.accessible-email.org/)\n\nThis free template is part of a pack of responsive email templates for developers and startups available on [HTML Email](https://htmlemail.io).\n[![image](https://github.com/leemunroe/responsive-html-email-template/assets/15963/61d4a6d7-bd0e-4241-b4e5-d766162df192)](https://htmlemail.io)\n\n",
