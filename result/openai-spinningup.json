Deep RL refers to the combination of RL with [deep learning](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/).\n\nThis module contains a variety of helpful resources, including:\n\n- a short [introduction](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html) to RL terminology, kinds of algorithms, and basic theory,\n- an [essay](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html) about how to grow into an RL research role,\n- a [curated list](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html) of important papers organized by topic,\n- a well-documented [code repo](https://github.com/openai/spinningup) of short, standalone implementations of key algorithms,\n- and a few [exercises](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/exercises.html) to serve as warm-ups.\n\nGet started at [spinningup.openai.com](https://spinningup.openai.com)!\n\n\nCiting Spinning Up\n------------------\n\nIf you reference or use Spinning Up in your research, please cite:\n\n```\n@article{SpinningUp2018,\n    author = {Achiam, Joshua},\n    title = {{Spinning Up in Deep Reinforcement Learning}},\n    year = {2018}\n}\n```",
