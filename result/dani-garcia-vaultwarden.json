DO NOT use the official Bitwarden support channels.**\n\n<br>\n\n## Features\n\nA nearly complete implementation of the Bitwarden Client API is provided, including:\n\n * [Personal Vault](https://bitwarden.com/help/managing-items/)\n * [Send](https://bitwarden.com/help/about-send/)\n * [Attachments](https://bitwarden.com/help/attachments/)\n * [Website icons](https://bitwarden.com/help/website-icons/)\n * [Personal API Key](https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/)\n * [Organizations](https://bitwarden.com/help/getting-started-organizations/)\n   - [Collections](https://bitwarden.com/help/about-collections/),\n     [Password Sharing](https://bitwarden.com/help/sharing/),\n     [Member Roles](https://bitwarden.com/help/user-types-access-control/),\n     [Groups](https://bitwarden.com/help/about-groups/),\n     [Event Logs](https://bitwarden.com/help/event-logs/),\n     [Admin Password Reset](https://bitwarden.com/help/admin-reset/),\n     [Directory Connector](https://bitwarden.com/help/directory-sync/),\n     [Policies](https://bitwarden.com/help/policies/)\n * [Multi/Two Factor Authentication](https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-field-guide-two-step-login/)\n   - [Authenticator](https://bitwarden.com/help/setup-two-step-login-authenticator/),\n     [Email](https://bitwarden.com/help/setup-two-step-login-email/),\n     [FIDO2 WebAuthn](https://bitwarden.com/help/setup-two-step-login-fido/),\n     [YubiKey](https://bitwarden.com/help/setup-two-step-login-yubikey/),\n     [Duo](https://bitwarden.com/help/setup-two-step-login-duo/)\n * [Emergency Access](https://bitwarden.com/help/emergency-access/)\n * [Vaultwarden Admin Backend](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-admin-page)\n * [Modified Web Vault client](https://github.com/dani-garcia/bw_web_builds) (Bundled within our containers)\n\n<br>\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Most modern web browsers disallow the use of Web Crypto APIs in insecure contexts. In this case, you might get an error like `Cannot read property 'importKey'`. To solve this problem, you need to access the web vault via HTTPS or localhost.\n>\n>This can be configured in [Vaultwarden directly](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS) or using a third-party reverse proxy ([some examples](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples)).\n>\n>If you have an available domain name, you can get HTTPS certificates with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), or you can generate self-signed certificates with utilities like [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). Some proxies automatically do this step, like Caddy or Traefik (see examples linked above).\n\n> [!TIP]\n>**For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).**\n\nThe main way to use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pkgs/container/vaultwarden), [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/vaultwarden/server).\n\nThere are also [community driven packages](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Third-party-packages) which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).\n\n### Docker/Podman CLI\n\nPull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.<br>\nYou can replace `docker` with `podman` if you prefer to use podman.\n\n```shell\ndocker pull vaultwarden/server:latest\ndocker run --detach --name vaultwarden \\\n  --env DOMAIN=\"https://vw.domain.tld\" \\\n  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \\\n  --restart unless-stopped \\\n  --publish 80:80 \\\n  vaultwarden/server:latest\n```\n\nThis will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.\n\n### Docker Compose\n\nTo use Docker compose you need to create a `compose.yaml` which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  vaultwarden:\n    image: vaultwarden/server:latest\n    container_name: vaultwarden\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      DOMAIN: \"https://vw.domain.tld\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./vw-data/:/data/\n    ports:\n      - 80:80\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## Get in touch\n\nHave a question, suggestion or need help?
