As you can see from its API, it is an abstract class that does not have a default constructor, so you must define a no-arg constructor:\n\n```java\npublic class SampleApplication extends TinkerApplication {\n    public SampleApplication() {\n      super(\n        //tinkerFlags, which types is supported\n        //dex only, library only, all support\n        ShareConstants.TINKER_ENABLE_ALL,\n        // This is passed as a string so the shell application does not\n        // have a binary dependency on your ApplicationLifeCycle class.\n        \"tinker.sample.android.app.SampleApplicationLike\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUse `tinker-android-anno` to generate your `Application` is recommended, you just need to add an annotation for your [SampleApplicationLike](https://github.com/Tencent/tinker/blob/master/tinker-sample-android/app/src/main/java/tinker/sample/android/app/SampleApplicationLike.java) class\n\n```java\n@DefaultLifeCycle(\napplication = \"tinker.sample.android.app.SampleApplication\",             //application name to generate\nflags = ShareConstants.TINKER_ENABLE_ALL)                                //tinkerFlags above\npublic class SampleApplicationLike extends DefaultApplicationLike\n```\n\nHow to install tinker? learn more at the sample [SampleApplicationLike](https://github.com/Tencent/tinker/blob/master/tinker-sample-android/app/src/main/java/tinker/sample/android/app/SampleApplicationLike.java).\n\nFor proguard, we have already made the proguard config automatic, and tinker will also generate the multiDex keep proguard file for you.\n\nFor more tinker configurations, learn more at the sample [app/build.gradle](https://github.com/Tencent/tinker/blob/master/tinker-sample-android/app/build.gradle).\n\n## Ark Support\nHow to run tinker on the Ark?\n### building patch\nJust use the following command:\n```buildconfig\nbash build_patch_dexdiff.sh old=xxx new=xxx\n```\n* `old` indicates the absolute path of android apk(not compiled by Ark) with bugs\n* `new` indicates the absolute path of android apk(not compiled by Ark) with fixing\n\nThe patch file is packaged in APK.\n### compiling in Ark\nTODO\n\nAt present it's compiled by Ark compiler team. The output patch is still packaged in APK format without signature.\n### packaging the patch\nFor tinker-cli, add the following lines to your `tinker_config.xml`. Otherwise, the default configure will be used.\n```xml\n<issue id=\"arkHot\">\n   <path value=\"arkHot\"/>         // path of patch\n   <name value=\"patch.apk\"/>      // name of patch\n</issue>\n```\nFor gradle, add the following lines to your `app/build.gradle`. Otherwise, the default configure will be used.\n```gradle\nark {\n   path = \"arkHot\"         // path of patch\n   name = \"patch.apk\"      // name of patch\n}\n```\nThe patch is compiled by Ark and placed on the above path. all subsequent operations are same as tinker-cli or gradle.\n\nThe ultimated patch APK consists of two patch files:\n\n* `classes.dex` for android\n* `patch.apk` with so for Ark.\n\n## Tinker Known Issues\nThere are some issues which Tinker can't dynamic update.\n\n1. Can't update AndroidManifest.xml, such as add Android Component.\n2. Do not support some Samsung models with os version android-21.\n3. Due to Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement, we can't dynamic update our apk.\n\n## Tinker Support\nAny problem?\n\n1. Learn more from [tinker-sample-android](https://github.com/Tencent/tinker/tree/master/tinker-sample-android).\n2. Read the [source code](https://github.com/Tencent/tinker/tree/master).\n3.
