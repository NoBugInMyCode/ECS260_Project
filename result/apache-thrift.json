        "readme": "Apache Thrift\n=============\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThrift is a lightweight, language-independent software stack for\npoint-to-point RPC implementation.\nThrift provides clean abstractions and implementations for data transport,\ndata serialization, and application level processing. The code generation\nsystem takes a simple definition language as input and generates code\nacross programming languages that uses the abstracted stack to build\ninteroperable RPC clients and servers.\n\n![Apache Thrift Layered Architecture](doc/images/thrift-layers.png)\n\nThrift makes it easy for programs written in different programming\nlanguages to share data and call remote procedures.  With support\nfor [28 programming languages](LANGUAGES.md), chances are Thrift\nsupports the languages that you currently use.\n\nThrift is specifically designed to support non-atomic version changes\nacross client and server code.  This allows you to upgrade your\nserver while still being able to service older clients; or have newer\nclients issue requests to older servers.  An excellent community-provided\nwrite-up about thrift and compatibility when versioning an API can be\nfound in the [Thrift Missing Guide](https://diwakergupta.github.io/thrift-missing-guide/#_versioning_compatibility).\n\nFor more details on Thrift's design and implementation, see the Thrift\nwhitepaper included in this distribution, or at the README.md file\nin your particular subdirectory of interest.\n\nStatus\n======\n\n| Branch | Travis | Appveyor | Coverity Scan | codecov.io | Website |\n| :----- | :----- | :------- | :------------ | :--------- | :------ |\n| [`master`](https://github.com/apache/thrift/tree/master) | [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/apache/thrift.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/apache/thrift/branches) | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/apache/thrift?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/thrift/history) | [![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/1345/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/thrift) | | [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/official-website-brightgreen.svg)](https://thrift.apache.org/) |\n| [`0.17.0`](https://github.com/apache/thrift/tree/0.17.0) | [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/apache/thrift.svg?branch=0.17.0)](https://app.travis-ci.com/apache/thrift/branches) | | | | |\n\nReleases\n========\n\nThrift does not maintain a specific release calendar at this time.\n\nWe strive to release twice yearly.  Download the [current release](http://thrift.apache.org/download).\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\nor more contributor license agreements.

Alternatively, see the docker build environments for a list of prerequisites.\n\nResources\n=========\n\nMore information about Thrift can be obtained on the Thrift webpage at:\n\n     http://thrift.apache.org\n\nAcknowledgments\n===============\n\nThrift was inspired by pillar, a lightweight RPC tool written by Adam D'Angelo,\nand also by Google's protocol buffers.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nIf you are building from the first time out of the source repository, you will\nneed to generate the configure scripts.  (This is not necessary if you\ndownloaded a tarball.)  From the top directory, do:\n\n    ./bootstrap.sh\n\nOnce the configure scripts are generated, thrift can be configured.\nFrom the top directory, do:\n\n    ./configure\n\nYou may need to specify the location of the boost files explicitly.\nIf you installed boost in `/usr/local`, you would run configure as follows:\n\n    ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local\n\nNote that by default the thrift C++ library is typically built with debugging\nsymbols included. If you want to customize these options you should use the\nCXXFLAGS option in configure, as such:\n\n    ./configure CXXFLAGS='-g -O2'\n    ./configure CFLAGS='-g -O2'\n    ./configure CPPFLAGS='-DDEBUG_MY_FEATURE'\n\nTo enable gcov required options -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage enable them:\n\n    ./configure  --enable-coverage\n\nRun ./configure --help to see other configuration options\n\nPlease be aware that the Python library will ignore the --prefix option\nand just install wherever Python's distutils puts it (usually along\nthe lines of `/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/`).  If you need to control\nwhere the Python modules are installed, set the PY_PREFIX variable.\n(DESTDIR is respected for Python and C++.)\n\nMake thrift:\n\n    make\n\nFrom the top directory, become superuser and do:\n\n    make install\n\nUninstall thrift:\n\n    make uninstall\n\nNote that some language packages must be installed manually using build tools\nbetter suited to those languages (at the time of this writing, this applies\nto Java, Ruby, PHP).\n\nLook for the README.md file in the lib/<language>/ folder for more details on the\ninstallation of each language library package.\n\nPackage Managers\n================\n\nApache Thrift is available via a number of package managers, a list which is\nis steadily growing. A more detailed overview can be found\n[at the Apache Thrift web site under \"Libraries\"](http://thrift.apache.org/lib/)\nand/or in the respective READMEs for each language under /lib\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThere are a large number of client library tests that can all be run\nfrom the top-level directory.\n\n    make -k check\n\nThis will make all of the libraries (as necessary), and run through\nthe unit tests defined in each of the client libraries. If a single\nlanguage fails, the make check will continue on and provide a synopsis\nat the end.\n\nTo run the cross-language test suite, please run:\n\n    make cross\n\nThis will run a set of tests that use different language clients and\nservers.\n\n\n",
