To run these examples, you'll need an OpenAI account and associated API key ([create a free account here](https://beta.openai.com/signup)). Set an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key. Alternatively, in most IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, you can create an `.env` file at the root of your repo containing `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>`, which will be picked up by the notebooks.\n\nMost code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.\n\nFor other useful tools, guides and courses, check out these [related resources from around the web](https://cookbook.openai.com/related_resources).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe OpenAI Cookbook is a community-driven resource. Whether you're submitting an idea, fixing a typo, adding a new guide, or improving an existing one, your contributions are greatly appreciated!\n\nBefore contributing, read through the existing issues and pull requests to see if someone else is already working on something similar. That way you can avoid duplicating efforts.\n\nIf there are examples or guides you'd like to see, feel free to suggest them on the [issues page](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/issues).\n\nIf you'd like to contribute new content, make sure to read through our [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome high-quality submissions of new examples and guides, as long as they meet our criteria and fit within the scope of the cookbook.\n\nThe contents of this repo are automatically rendered into [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com) based on [registry.yaml](/registry.yaml).\n\n[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=468576060&machine=basicLinux32gb&location=EastUs)\n",
