Similar programs are sometimes called \"Terminal Multiplexers\".\n\nZellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the box as well as the advanced features it places at its users' fingertips.\n\nZellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep customizability, personal automation through [layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts.html), true multiplayer collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, and a [plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins.html) allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.\n\nYou can get started by [installing](https://zellij.dev/documentation/installation.html) Zellij and checking out the [Screencasts & Tutorials](https://zellij.dev/screencasts/).\n\nFor more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our [roadmap](#roadmap).\n\n## How do I install it?\n\nThe easiest way to install Zellij is through a [package for your OS](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_INSTALL.md).\n\nIf one is not available for your OS, you could download a prebuilt binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`. If you'd like, we could [automatically choose one for you](#try-zellij-without-installing).\n\nYou can also install (compile) with `cargo`:\n\n```\ncargo install --locked zellij\n```\n\n#### Try Zellij without installing\n\nbash/zsh:\n```bash\nbash <(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)\n```\nfish/xonsh:\n```bash\nbash -c 'bash <(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)'\n```\n\n#### Installing from `main`\nInstalling Zellij from the `main` branch is not recommended. This branch represents pre-release code, is constantly being worked on and may contain broken or unusable features. In addition, using it may corrupt the cache for future versions, forcing users to clear it before they can use the officially released version.\n\nThat being said - no-one will stop you from using it (and bug reports involving new features are greatly appreciated), but please consider using the latest release instead as detailed at the top of this section.\n\n## How do I start a development environment?\n\n* Clone the project\n* In the project folder, for debug builds run: `cargo xtask run`\n* To run all tests: `cargo xtask test`\n\nFor more build commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Configuration\nFor configuring Zellij, please see the [Configuration Documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html).\n\n## About issues in this repository\nIssues in this repository, whether open or closed, do not necessarily indicate a problem or a bug in the software. They only indicate that the reporter wanted to communicate their experiences or thoughts to the maintainers. The Zellij maintainers do their best to go over and reply to all issue reports, but unfortunately cannot promise these will always be dealt with or even read. Your understanding is appreciated.\n\n## Roadmap\nPresented here is the project roadmap, divided into three main sections.\n\nThese are issues that are either being actively worked on or are planned for the near future.\n\n***If you'll click on the image, you'll be led to an SVG version of it on the website where you can directly click on every issue***\n\n[![roadmap](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/assets/795598/9c5b573b-20f5-41c6-908b-6b21c5fd456e)](https://zellij.dev/roadmap)\n\n## Origin of the Name\n[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij)\n\nZellij (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0644\u064a\u062c, romanized: zill\u012bj; also spelled zillij or zellige) is a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces. The pieces were typically of different colours and fitted together to form various patterns on the basis of tessellations, most notably elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns composed of various polygons. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of architecture in the western Islamic world. It is found in the architecture of Morocco, the architecture of Algeria, early Islamic sites in Tunisia, and in the historic monuments of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Sponsored by\n<a href=\"https://terminaltrove.com/\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121595180?s=200&v=4\" width=\"80px\"></a>\n",
