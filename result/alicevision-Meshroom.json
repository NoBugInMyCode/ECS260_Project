In that case, you need to force usage of native drivers by adding them to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH:\n`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia-340 PYTHONPATH=$PWD python meshroom/ui`\nYou may need to adjust the folder `/usr/lib/nvidia-340` with the correct driver version.\n\n - __Launch a 3D reconstruction in command line__\n\n```bash\n# Windows: set PYTHONPATH=%CD% &&\n# Linux/macOS: PYTHONPATH=$PWD\npython bin/meshroom_batch --input INPUT_IMAGES_FOLDER --output OUTPUT_FOLDER\n```\n\n## Start Meshroom without building AliceVision\n\nTo use Meshroom (ui) without building AliceVision\n*   Download a [release](https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/releases)\n*   Checkout corresponding Meshroom (ui) version/tag to avoid versions incompatibilities\n*   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/foo/Meshroom-2023.2.0/aliceVision/lib/ PATH=$PATH:~/foo/Meshroom-2023.2.0/aliceVision/bin/ PYTHONPATH=$PWD python3 meshroom/ui`\n\n## Start and Debug Meshroom in an IDE\n\nPyCharm Community is free IDE which can be used. To start and debug a project with that IDE,\nright-click on `Meshroom/ui/__main__.py` > `Debug`, then `Edit Configuration`, in `Environment variables` : \n*   If you want to use aliceVision built by yourself add: `PATH=$PATH:/foo/build/Linux-x86_64/`\n*   If you want to use aliceVision release add: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/foo/Meshroom-2023.2.0/aliceVision/lib/;PATH=$PATH:/foo/Meshroom-2023.2.0/aliceVision/bin/` (Make sure that you are on the branch matching the right version)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/937836/127321375-3bf78e73-569d-414a-8649-de0307adf794.png)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee the [Meshroom wiki](https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/wiki) for more information.\n\n\n## Contact\n\nUse the public mailing-list to ask questions or request features.
