Prefix your issue with \"x/tools/(your\nsubdir):\" in the subject line, so it is easy to find.\n\n### JavaScript and CSS Formatting\n\nThis repository uses [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format JS and CSS files.\n\nThe version of `prettier` used is 1.18.2.\n\nIt is encouraged that all JS and CSS code be run through this before submitting\na change. However, it is not a strict requirement enforced by CI.\n",
