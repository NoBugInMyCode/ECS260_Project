This work is merely a demonstration of what adept attackers can do. It is the defender's responsibility to take such attacks into consideration and find ways to protect their users against this type of phishing attacks. Evilginx should be used only in legitimate penetration testing assignments with written permission from to-be-phished parties.\n\n## Evilginx Mastery Training Course\n\nIf you want everything about reverse proxy phishing with **Evilginx** - check out my [Evilginx Mastery](https://academy.breakdev.org/evilginx-mastery) course!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://academy.breakdev.org/evilginx-mastery\"><img alt=\"Evilginx Mastery\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kgretzky/evilginx2/master/media/img/evilginx_mastery.jpg\" height=\"320\" /></a>\n</p>\n\nLearn everything about the latest methods of phishing, using reverse proxying to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication.
