It can be done in several\ndifferent ways. Use the docs (and examples) Luke!\n::\n\n  from datetime import datetime\n  import backtrader as bt\n\n  class SmaCross(bt.SignalStrategy):\n      def __init__(self):\n          sma1, sma2 = bt.ind.SMA(period=10), bt.ind.SMA(period=30)\n          crossover = bt.ind.CrossOver(sma1, sma2)\n          self.signal_add(bt.SIGNAL_LONG, crossover)\n\n  cerebro = bt.Cerebro()\n  cerebro.addstrategy(SmaCross)\n\n  data0 = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceData(dataname='MSFT', fromdate=datetime(2011, 1, 1),\n                                    todate=datetime(2012, 12, 31))\n  cerebro.adddata(data0)\n\n  cerebro.run()\n  cerebro.plot()\n\nIncluding a full featured chart. Give it a try! This is included in the samples\nas ``sigsmacross/sigsmacross2.py``. Along it is ``sigsmacross.py`` which can be\nparametrized from the command line.\n\nFeatures:\n=========\n\nLive Trading and backtesting platform written in Python.\n\n  - Live Data Feed and Trading with\n\n    - Interactive Brokers (needs ``IbPy`` and benefits greatly from an\n      installed ``pytz``)\n    - *Visual Chart* (needs a fork of ``comtypes`` until a pull request is\n      integrated in the release and benefits from ``pytz``)\n    - *Oanda* (needs ``oandapy``) (REST API Only - v20 did not support\n      streaming when implemented)\n\n  - Data feeds from csv/files, online sources or from *pandas* and *blaze*\n  - Filters for datas, like breaking a daily bar into chunks to simulate\n    intraday or working with Renko bricks\n  - Multiple data feeds and multiple strategies supported\n  - Multiple timeframes at once\n  - Integrated Resampling and Replaying\n  - Step by Step backtesting or at once (except in the evaluation of the Strategy)\n  - Integrated battery of indicators\n  - *TA-Lib* indicator support (needs python *ta-lib* / check the docs)\n  - Easy development of custom indicators\n  - Analyzers (for example: TimeReturn, Sharpe Ratio, SQN) and ``pyfolio``\n    integration (**deprecated**)\n  - Flexible definition of commission schemes\n  - Integrated broker simulation with *Market*, *Close*, *Limit*, *Stop*,\n    *StopLimit*, *StopTrail*, *StopTrailLimit*and *OCO* orders, bracket order,\n    slippage, volume filling strategies and continuous cash adjustmet for\n    future-like instruments\n  - Sizers for automated staking\n  - Cheat-on-Close and Cheat-on-Open modes\n  - Schedulers\n  - Trading Calendars\n  - Plotting (requires matplotlib)\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThe blog:\n\n  - `Blog <http://www.backtrader.com/blog>`_\n\nRead the full documentation at:\n\n  - `Documentation <http://www.backtrader.com/docu>`_\n\nList of built-in Indicators (122)\n\n  - `Indicators Reference <http://www.backtrader.com/docu/indautoref.html>`_\n\nPython 2/3 Support\n==================\n\n  - Python >= ``3.2``\n\n  - It also works with ``pypy`` and ``pypy3`` (no plotting - ``matplotlib`` is\n    not supported under *pypy*)\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n``backtrader`` is self-contained with no external dependencies (except if you\nwant to plot)\n\nFrom *pypi*:\n\n  - ``pip install backtrader``\n\n  - ``pip install backtrader[plotting]``\n\n    If ``matplotlib`` is not installed and you wish to do some plotting\n\n.. note:: The minimum matplotlib version is ``1.4.1``\n\nAn example for *IB* Data Feeds/Trading:\n\n  - ``IbPy`` doesn't seem to be in PyPi. Do either::\n\n      pip install git+https://github.com/blampe/IbPy.git\n\n    or (if ``git`` is not available in your system)::\n\n      pip install https://github.com/blampe/IbPy/archive/master.zip\n\nFor other functionalities like: ``Visual Chart``, ``Oanda``, ``TA-Lib``, check\nthe dependencies in the documentation.\n\nFrom source:\n\n  - Place the *backtrader* directory found in the sources inside your project\n\nVersion numbering\n=================\n\nX.Y.Z.I\n\n  - X: Major version number. Should stay stable unless something big is changed\n    like an overhaul to use ``numpy``\n  - Y: Minor version number. To be changed upon adding a complete new feature or\n    (god forbids) an incompatible API change.\n  - Z: Revision version number. To be changed for documentation updates, small\n    changes, small bug fixes\n  - I: Number of Indicators already built into the platform\n",
