The bug was introduced in commit [ac0b3fe0](https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/commit/ac0b3fe0) and might affect ecc key generation on platforms without a platform random number generator.\n\nSecurity Contact\n====\nSecurity Mail: sjcl@ovt.me  \nOpenPGP-Key Fingerprint: 0D54 3E52 87B4 EC06 3FA9 0115 72ED A6C7 7AAF 48ED  \nKeyserver: pool.sks-keyservers.net  \n\nUpgrade Guide\n====\n\n## 1.0.3 -> 1.0.4\n\n`codecBase32` has been re-enabled with changes to conform to [RFC 4648](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-6):\n\n* Padding with `=` is now applied to the output of `fromBits`. If you don't want that padding, you can disable it by calling `fromBits` with a second parameter of `true` or anything that evaluates as \"truthy\" in JS\n* The encoding alphabet for `sjcl.codec.base32` now matches that specified by the RFC, rather than the extended hex alphabet.\n* The former extended hex alphabet is now available through `sjcl.codec.base32hex` (also matching the RFC). So if you encoded something with `base32` before, you'll want to decode it with `base32hex` now.\n\nDocumentation\n====\nThe documentation is available [here](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/doc/)\n",
