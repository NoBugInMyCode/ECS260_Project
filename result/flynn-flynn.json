[Take a look at our older README](https://github.com/flynn/flynn/blob/2c20757de8b32a40ba06f7e5b363b2d4dd6b332e/README.md))_\n\nAll public Flynn-related infrastructure including binary release hosting and cluster discovery has been shut down.\n\nFlynn no longer receives security updates, we strongly recommend transitioning to another system as soon as possible.\n\nWe thank everyone for their support and engagement over the years, and we're sorry that we won't be able to continue developing the platform.\n\nThe Flynn Team\n\n_PS: If you want a Flynn sticker or t-shirt, [we still have some left](https://shop.flynn.io)._\n",
