CVS, mail, mailing lists, etc etc etc.\n>\n> These days, lots of that stuff is available as SaaS. What are the tools and services people use instead of hosting their own?\n>\n> (I'm not talking about actual production services like EC2 and Heroku and whatnot. We can go over this in another thread.)\n\nIn 2013, Sharjeel Qureshi, [posted the following](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5235137):\n\n> Few years ago, Joshua Schachter started this thread on HN for discussing hosted useful services: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1769910\n>\n> The contribution in thread introduced many interesting SaaS services which can immensely help in deploying services as well as development.\n>\n> It's been three years since then. What do we have today?\n\nMany thanks to the big contributors to the previous threads, including garrettdimon, espeed, netshade, and cmadan, and many more that I haven't named.\n\n##### Now\n\nI've collected more data from Hacker News, AngelList and Quora, to make the 2015 and beyond version. This list also includes self-hosted as well as hosted services.\n\nIt's on GitHub for a reason! Please submit pull requests.\n\n## Supported with \u2764\ufe0f by [Instabug](https://instabug.com/android/sdk?utm_source=toolsofthetrade&utm_medium=spon&utm_content=header)\n### Understand How Your App is Doing with Real-Time Contextual Insights From Your Users\n[![instabug-github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10850625/65512691-fd45f280-ded9-11e9-8921-3528b98c30a7.png)](https://instabug.com/android/sdk?utm_source=toolsofthetrade&utm_medium=spon&utm_content=banner)\n>Instabug helps Android developers easily collect bugs and feedback from beta testers and users to iterate faster and ship quality apps.
