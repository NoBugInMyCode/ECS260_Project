That work has\nsince become part of Flutter, and all that remains here are experimental,\nearly-stage desktop\n[plugins](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages).\n\nIf you want to get started with Flutter on desktop, the place to start is now\n[the Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/desktop), rather than this project.\nYou will already need to have followed the instructions there to get an application\nrunning on desktop before using any of the plugins here.\n\n## Feedback\n\n**Do not file issues about Flutter for desktop here.** Since the\nembeddings have all moved to the Flutter project, the place for desktop bugs\nand feature requests is now [the Flutter issue\ntracker](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues).\n\nFor bug reports and feature requests **related to the plugins in this repository**,\nplease file issues here.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\nThe `plugins` directory contains all the plugins. See\n[its README](plugins/README.md) to get started.\n\n## Caveats\n\n* This is not an officially supported Google product.\n",
