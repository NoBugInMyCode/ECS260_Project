It\u2019s global, it\u2019s versatile and it\u2019s distinctly IBM.\n\nWe designed the IBM Plex typeface carefully to meet our needs as a global tech company and express who we are as IBMers. It took two years and a lot of work to get here, but today, we have a signature typeface we\u2019re proud of and excited to share with the world. Discover more about our development of the [IBM Plex typeface](https://www.ibm.com/plex/).\n\nThe IBM Plex typeface is an open-source project available for download and various uses following the Open Font License (OFL). The IBM Plex family comes in Sans, Serif, Mono, and Sans Condensed, all with Roman and true italics. Plex has been designed to work well in user interface (UI) environments and other mediums. This project provides all source files and multiple formats to support most typographical situations. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports extended Latin, Arabic, Chinese (Traditional), Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, and Thai.\n\nAdditionally, we have introduced IBM Plex\u00ae Math. This highly anticipated release includes over 5,000 new glyphs, covering a wide range of mathematical symbols such as alphanumeric, double-struck, Fraktur, operators, script, icons, arrows, Greek letters, phonetics, technical and geometric shapes \u2014 making it one of the most complete math fonts available today. IBM Plex Math provides a fresh and comprehensive alternative to STIX and Microsoft\u2019s Cambria. Its compatibility with IBM Plex Serif Regular makes it an ideal choice for IBM researchers and mathematicians.\n\nThanks for trying the IBM Plex typeface! We hope you like it.\n\n## Add the IBM Plex typeface to your device\n\nPlease download the latest zip files from our [releases page](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases) for installation.\n\n### IBM Plex typeface packages\n\n| Package                   | NPM                                                                                    |\n| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| IBM Plex Math             | [@ibm/plex-math](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-math)                         |\n| IBM Plex Mono             | [@ibm/plex-mono](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-mono)                         |\n| IBM Plex Sans             | [@ibm/plex-sans](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans)                         |\n| IBM Plex Sans Arabic      | [@ibm/plex-sans-arabic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans-arabic)           |\n| IBM Plex Sans Condensed   | [@ibm/plex-sans-condensed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans-condensed)     |\n| IBM Plex Sans Devanagari  | [@ibm/plex-sans-devanagari](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans-devanagari)   |\n| IBM Plex Sans Hebrew      | [@ibm/plex-sans-hebrew](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans-hebrew)           |\n| IBM Plex Sans Japanese    | [@ibm/plex-sans-jp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans-jp)                   |\n| IBM Plex Sans Korean      | [@ibm/plex-sans-kr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans-kr)                   |\n| IBM Plex Sans Chinese TC  | [@ibm/plex-sans-tc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans-tc)                   |\n| IBM Plex Sans Chinese SC  | [@ibm/plex-sans-sc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans-sc)                   |\n| IBM Plex Sans Thai        | [@ibm/plex-sans-thai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans-thai)               |\n| IBM Plex Sans Thai Looped | [@ibm/plex-sans-thai-looped](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-sans-thai-looped) |\n| IBM Plex Serif            | [@ibm/plex-serif](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/plex-serif)                       |\n",
