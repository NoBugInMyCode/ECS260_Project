Unlike other frameworks, libGDX does not impose a specific design or coding style, allowing you the freedom to create games according to your preferences.\r\n\r\n## Open Source, Feature Packed, and Fostering a Large Third-Party Ecosystem\r\nlibGDX is released under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), offering unrestricted usage in both commercial and non-commercial projects. While not mandatory, we appreciate any credit given to libGDX when you release a game or app using it. Check out our [showcase](https://libgdx.com/showcase/) for a selection of popular libGDX-powered games. With libGDX, you gain access to a comprehensive set of tools and features to develop multi-platform 2D and 3D games using Java.\r\n\r\nMoreover, libGDX boasts a vibrant third-party ecosystem, with numerous [tools](https://libgdx.com/dev/tools/) and libraries that streamline development tasks. Explore the [awesome-libgdx](https://github.com/rafaskb/awesome-libgdx#readme) repository for a curated list of libGDX-centered libraries, serving as an excellent starting point for newcomers in the libGDX community.\r\n\r\n![](https://libgdx.com/assets/images/index_showcase/game0.png)\r\n###### An example game created with libGDX: [Pathway](https://store.steampowered.com/app/546430/Pathway/) by Robotality. Discover more captivating games in our [Showcase](https://libgdx.com/showcase/).\r\n\r\n## Getting Started with libGDX / Documentation\r\nThanks to Gradle, you can easily set up libGDX without the need to download the framework itself. Your favorite build tool can handle everything for you. Additionally, we offer a convenient [setup tool](https://libgdx.com/dev/#how-to-get-started-with-libgdx) that automates project creation and downloads all the necessary components. Check out our **[website](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/setup)** for instructions on getting started or refer to our comprehensive **[wiki](https://libgdx.com/wiki/)**.\r\n\r\n- [Creating a libGDX Project](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/setup)\r\n- [Building a Simple Game](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/a-simple-game)\r\n- [Tutorials & Demos](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/demos-and-tutorials)\r\n\r\nWe provide the libGDX [javadocs](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.badlogicgames.gdx) online for easy reference. Additionally, the javadocs are bundled with every libGDX distribution, ensuring smooth integration with your preferred IDE.\r\n\r\n## Community & Contribution\r\nStay up to date with the **latest libGDX news** by following our [blog](https://libgdx.com/news/). For engaging discussions and support, join our official [libGDX Discord](https://libgdx.com/community/discord/).\r\n\r\n### Reporting Issues\r\nUse the **[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues)** here on GitHub to report any issues you encounter. Before submitting, please read our [Getting Help](https://libgdx.com/wiki/articles/getting-help) guide, which walks you through the process of reporting an issue effectively.\r\n\r\n### Contributing to the Codebase\r\nlibGDX benefits greatly from contributions made by our dedicated developer community. We appreciate any assistance in making libGDX even better. Check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for details on how to contribute. Note that contributing involves working directly with libGDX's source code, a process that regular users do not typically undertake. Refer to the [Working with the Source](https://libgdx.com/dev/from-source/) article for guidance.\r\n\r\nYou can also support our infrastructure (build server, web server, test devices) by contributing financially through our [Patreon](https://patreon.com/libgdx)!\r\n",
