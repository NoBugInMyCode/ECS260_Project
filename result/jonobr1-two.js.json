It is renderer agnostic enabling the same api to render in multiple contexts: webgl, canvas2d, and svg.\n\n[Home](http://two.js.org/) \u2022 [Releases](https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js/releases) \u2022 [Examples](http://two.js.org/examples/) \u2022 [Documentation](https://two.js.org/docs/two/) \u2022\u00a0[Change Log](https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js/tree/dev/wiki/changelog) \u2022 [Help](https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js/issues/new/choose)\n\n## Usage\nDownload the latest [minified library](https://raw.github.com/jonobr1/two.js/dev/build/two.min.js) and include it in your html.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"js/two.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nIt can also be installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/two.js), Node Package Manager:\n\n```js\nnpm install --save two.js\n```\nAlternatively see [how to build the library yourself](https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js#custom-build).\n\n\nHere is boilerplate html in order to draw a spinning rectangle in two.js:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <script src=\"js/two.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <script>\n      var two = new Two({\n        fullscreen: true,\n        autostart: true\n      }).appendTo(document.body);\n      var rect = two.makeRectangle(two.width / 2, two.height / 2, 50 ,50);\n      two.bind('update', function() {\n        rect.rotation += 0.001;\n      });\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Custom Build\nTwo.js uses [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) in order to build source files. You'll first want to install that. Once installed open up a terminal and head to the repository folder:\n\n```\ncd ~/path-to-repo/two.js\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis will give you a number of libraries that the development of Two.js relies on. If for instance you only use the `SVGRenderer` then you can really cut down on the file size by excluding the other renderers. To do this, modify `/utils/build.js` to only add the files you'd like. Then run:\n\n```\nnode ./utils/build\n```\n\nAnd the resulting `/build/two.js` and `/build/two.min.js` will be updated to your specification.\n\n---\n\n### Using ES6 Imports\n\nAs of version `v0.7.5+` Two.js is compatible with EcmaScript 6 imports. This is typically employed in contemporary frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) as well as bundling libraries like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), and [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). This adaptation of the boilerplate can be found on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/beautiful-wilbur-ygxbc?file=/src/App.js:0-664):\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport Two from \"two.js\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  var domElement = useRef();\n\n  useEffect(setup, []);\n\n  function setup() {\n    var two = new Two({\n      fullscreen: true,\n      autostart: true\n    }).appendTo(domElement.current);\n\n    var rect = two.makeRectangle(two.width / 2, two.height / 2, 50, 50);\n    two.bind(\"update\", update);\n\n    return unmount;\n\n    function unmount() {\n      two.unbind(\"update\");\n      two.pause();\n      domElement.current.removeChild(two.renderer.domElement);\n    }\n\n    function update() {\n      rect.rotation += 0.001;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return <div ref={domElement} />;\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to importing, the published packages of Two.js include the specific modules. So, if necessary you can import specific modules from the source code and bundle / minify for yourself like so:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Vector } from 'two.js/src/vector.js';\n\n// In TypeScript environments leave out the \".js\"\n// when importing modules directly. e.g:\nimport { Vector } from 'two.js/src/vector';\n```\n\n_While useful, the main import of the `Two` namespace imports all modules. So, there isn't yet proper tree shaking implemented for the library, though it's on the roadmap._\n\n### Running in Headless Environments\n\nAs of version `v0.7.x` Two.js can also run in a headless environment, namely running on the server with the help of a library called [Node Canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas). We don't add Node Canvas to dependencies of Two.js because it's _not necessary_ to run it in the browser. However, it has all the hooks set up to run in a cloud environment. To get started follow the installation instructions on Automattic's [readme](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#installation). After you've done that run:\n\n```\nnpm install canvas\nnpm install two.js\n```\n\nNow in a JavaScript file set up your Two.js scenegraph and save out frames whenever you need to:\n\n```javascript\nvar { createCanvas, Image } = require('canvas');\nvar Two = require('two.js')\n\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar path = require('path');\n\nvar width = 800;\nvar height = 600;\n\nvar canvas = createCanvas(width, height);\nTwo.Utils.shim(canvas, Image);\n\nvar time = Date.now();\n\nvar two = new Two({\n  width: width,\n  height: height,\n  domElement: canvas\n});\n\nvar rect = two.makeRectangle(width / 2, height / 2, 50, 50);\nrect.fill = 'rgb(255, 100, 100)';\nrect.noStroke();\n\ntwo.render();\n\nvar settings = { compressionLevel: 3, filters: canvas.PNG_FILTER_NONE };\nfs.writeFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, './images/rectangle.png'), canvas.toBuffer('image/png', settings));\nconsole.log('Finished rendering. Time took: ', Date.now() - time);\n\nprocess.exit();\n\n```\n\n## Build Documentation\nThe [Two.js](http://two.js.org/) website is bundled with this repository. Relying on [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) the repository generates a website based on numerous `README.md` files housed in the `wiki` directory. Use the following the node commands as follows:\n\n```bash\nnpm run docs:generate   // Generate README.md files for documentation from source code comments\nnpm run docs:dev        // Creates a local server to generate all documentation\nnpm run docs:build      // Builds out static site and associated files to wiki/.vuepress/dist\n```\n\nN.B: Vuepress is a legacy library and as such these commands rely on an older version of Node. Run `nvm use` if you get errors. If you don't use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) then see `.nvmrc` to install the correct version of node on your local machine.\n\n## Change Log\nTwo.js has been in operation since 2012. For a full list of changes from its first alpha version built with [Three.js](http://threejs.org/) to the most up-to-date tweaks.
