If you are looking for the code examples of the **2nd Edition**, please refer to [this](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition#whats-new-in-the-second-edition-from-the-first-edition) repository instead. \n\n---\n\nWhat you can expect are 400 pages rich in useful material just about everything you need to know to get started with machine learning ... from theory to the actual code that you can directly put into action! This is not yet just another \"this is how scikit-learn works\" book. I aim to explain all the underlying concepts, tell you everything you need to know in terms of best practices and caveats, and\nwe will put those concepts into action mainly using NumPy, scikit-learn, and Theano.\n\nYou are not sure if this book is for you?

I got a chance to read a review copy and it\u2019s just as I expected - really great! It\u2019s well organized, super easy to follow, and it not only offers a good foundation for smart, non-experts, practitioners will get some ideas and learn new tricks here as well.*  \n\u2013 Lon Riesberg at [Data Elixir](http://dataelixir.com/issues/55#start)\n\n> *Superb job! Thus far, for me it seems to have hit the right balance of theory and practice\u2026math and code!*   \n\u2013 [Brian Thomas](http://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2015/writing-pymle.html#comment-2295668894)\n\n> *I've read (virtually) every Machine Learning title based around Scikit-learn and this is hands-down the best one out there.*    \n\u2013 [Jason Wolosonovich](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/python-machine-learning-sebastian-raschka-review-jason-wolosonovich?trk=prof-post)\n\n> *The best book I've seen to come out of PACKT Publishing. This is a very well written introduction to machine learning with Python. As others have noted, a perfect mixture of theory and application.*    \n\u2013 [Josh D.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27WB1GWTNGIR2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783555130)\n\n> *A book with a blend of qualities that is hard to come by: combines the needed mathematics to control the theory with the applied coding in Python. Also great to see it doesn't waste paper in giving a primer on Python as many other books do just to appeal to the greater audience. You can tell it's been written by knowledgeable writers and not just DIY geeks.*    \n\u2013 [Amazon Customer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZWY4TF66Z6V0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783555130)\n\n> *Sebastian Raschka created an amazing machine learning tutorial which combines theory with practice. The book explains machine learning from a theoretical perspective and has tons of coded examples to show how you would actually use the machine learning technique. It can be read by a beginner or advanced programmer.*\n- William P.

I am really happy about all the great feedback you sent me so far, and I am glad that the book has been so useful to a broad audience.\n\nOver the last couple of months, I received hundreds of emails, and I tried to answer as many as possible in the available time I have. To make them useful to other readers as well, I collected many of my answers in the FAQ section (below).\n\nIn addition, some of you asked me about a platform for readers to discuss the contents of the book. I hope that this would provide an opportunity for you to discuss and share your knowledge with other readers:\n\n#### [Google Groups Discussion Board](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-machine-learning-reader-discussion-board)\n\n(And I will try my best to answer questions myself if time allows! :))\n\n> The only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. It is never of any use to oneself.  \n\u2014 Oscar Wilde\n\n---\n\n## Examples and Applications by Readers\n\nOnce again, I have to say (big!) THANKS for all the nice feedback about the book. I've received many emails from readers, who\nput the concepts and examples from this book out into the real world and make good use of them in their projects. In this section, I am\nstarting to gather some of these great applications, and I'd be more than happy to add your project to this list -- just shoot me a quick mail!\n\n- [40 scripts on Optical Character Recognition](https://github.com/rrlyman/PythonMachineLearingExamples) by [Richard Lyman](https://github.com/rrlyman)\n- [Code experiments](https://github.com/jeremyn/python-machine-learning-book) by [Jeremy Nation](https://github.com/jeremyn)\n- [What I Learned Implementing a Classifier from Scratch in Python](http://www.jeannicholashould.com) by [Jean-Nicholas Hould](http://www.jeannicholashould.com)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### General Questions\n\n- [What are machine learning and data science?](./faq/datascience-ml.md)\n- [Why do you and other people sometimes implement machine learning algorithms from scratch?](./faq/implementing-from-scratch.md)\n- [What learning path/discipline in data science I should focus on?](./faq/data-science-career.md)\n- [At what point should one start contributing to open source?](./faq/open-source.md)\n- [How important do you think having a mentor is to the learning process?](./faq/mentor.md)\n- [Where are the best online communities centered around data science/machine learning or python?](./faq/ml-python-communities.md)\n- [How would you explain machine learning to a software engineer?](./faq/ml-to-a-programmer.md)\n- [How would your curriculum for a machine learning beginner look like?](./faq/ml-curriculum.md)\n- [What is the Definition of Data Science?](./faq/definition_data-science.md)\n- [How do Data Scientists perform model selection?
