It was built by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io?utm_source=htg&utm_medium=readme) and many amazing contributors. All content on the site is completely free and open-source.\n\n[![](http://i.imgur.com/67oYe9q.png)](https://www.howtographql.com)\n\n> **Note**: This repository is currently mostly unmaintained. We are looking for maintainers who can help cleaning up issues and PRs opened by the community. If you are interested in helping out, please [reach out](mailto:burk@prisma.io)!\n\n## Content\n\nThe content for all tutorials is located in the  [`/content`](https://github.com/howtographql/howtographql/tree/master/content) directory. Here is an overview of all the tutorials that are available at the moment:\n\n#### GraphQL\n\n- Fundamentals of GraphQL\n- Advanced GraphQL\n\n#### Frontend\n\n- React & Apollo\n- React & Relay (Out of date)\n- Vue & Apollo (Out of date)\n- Ember & Apollo (Out of date)\n\n#### Backend\n\n- javascript-apollo / JavaScript & Apollo\n- typescript-apollo / Typescript & Apollo\n- typescript-helix / Typescript & Helix\n- graphql-elixir / Absinthe & Elixir\n- graphql-ruby / Ruby and GraphQL Gem\n- graphql-python / Python & Graphene\n- graphql-go / Go & gqlgen\n- graphql-scala / Scala & Sangria   \n- graphql-java / Java (Out of date)\n\n\n\n## Contributions / Fixes\n\nAs the whole project is open-source, you're more than welcome to fix typos and other small issues yourself and create a PR for the fix. If you want to contribute a whole tutorial track or update one of the out of date tutorials please [get in touch](mailto:burk@prisma.io).\n\n## Installation & Running locally\n\nThe project has some native (gyp) dependencies. To get this running, please make sure your environment it set with the following:\n\n1. Make sure to install a Node version manager (either [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))\n1. Point your environment to the version specified in `.nvmrc`.\n1. Make sure to load `.env` to your environment variables (some shell loads it automatically, but if not, you can do: `source .env` to load it)\n\nYou can run a local instance of How to GraphQL by executing the following commands in a terminal:\n\n```sh\ngit clone git@github.com:howtographql/howtographql.git\ncd howtographql\nyarn install\nyarn start # http://localhost:8000/\n```\n\n> Note: If you're using Node 8, you might need to invoke `npm install -g node-gyp` before you're starting the app. More info [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/1754).\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you are having issues with `sharp` dependency, please make sure you have installed `>0.18.2` of it. Older versions have hardcoded dependency on a legacy artifactory. \n\nTo check the version you have, run: `yarn why sharp`. \n\nIf you are still having issues, please make sure that you have `SHARP_DIST_BASE_URL` environemnt variable set correctly (see `.env` file) and then run `yarn install` again.\n\n",
