This is automatically converted\ninto a playable game complete with online multiplayer\nfeatures, all without requiring you to write a single line of\nnetworking or storage code.\n\n### Features\n\n- **State Management**: Game state is managed seamlessly across clients, server and storage automatically.\n- **Multiplayer**: Game state is kept in sync in realtime and across platforms.\n- **AI**: Automatically generated bots that can play your game.\n- **Game Phases**: with different game rules and turn orders per phase.\n- **Lobby**: Player matchmaking and game creation.\n- **Prototyping**: Interface to simulate moves even before you render the game.\n- **Extendable**: Plugin system that allows creating new abstractions.\n- **View-layer Agnostic**: Use the vanilla JS client or the bindings for React / React Native.\n- **Logs**: Game logs with the ability to time travel (viewing the board at an earlier state).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install boardgame.io\n```\n\n### Documentation\n\nRead our [Full Documentation](https://boardgame.io/documentation/) to learn how to\nuse boardgame.io, and join the [community on gitter](https://gitter.im/boardgame-io/General)\nto ask your questions!\n\n### Running examples in this repository\n\n```sh\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nThe examples can be found in the [examples](examples/) folder.\n\n#### Using VS Code?\n\nThis repository is ready to run in a dev container in VS Code.
