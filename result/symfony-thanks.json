        "readme": "<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://symfony.com\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"https://symfony.com/logos/symfony_black_02.svg\">\n</a></p>\n\nGive thanks (in the form of a [GitHub \u2605 ](https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars/)) to your fellow PHP package maintainers (not limited to Symfony components)!\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nInstall this as any other (dev) Composer package:\n```sh\ncomposer require --dev symfony/thanks\n```\n\nYou can also install it once for all your local projects:\n```sh\ncomposer global require symfony/thanks\n```\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n```sh\ncomposer thanks\n```\n\nThis will find all of your Composer dependencies, find their github.com repository, and star their GitHub repositories. This was inspired by `cargo thanks`, which was inspired in part by Medium's clapping button as a way to show thanks for someone else's work you've found enjoyment in.\n\nIf you're wondering why did some dependencies get thanked and not others, the answer is that this plugin only supports github.com at the moment. Pull requests are welcome to add support for thanking packages hosted on other services.\n\nOriginal idea by Doug Tangren (softprops) 2017 for Rust (thanks!)\n\nImplemented by Nicolas Grekas (SensioLabs & Blackfire.io) 2017 for PHP.\n\nForwarding stars\n----------------\n\nPackage authors can *send* a star to another package that they would like to thank.\n\nIf you are a package author and want to thank another repository, you can add a `thanks` entry in the `extra` section of your `composer.json` file.\n\nFor example, `symfony/webpack-encore-pack` sends a star to `symfony/webpack-encore`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"extra\": {\n        \"thanks\": {\n            \"name\": \"symfony/webpack-encore\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n",
