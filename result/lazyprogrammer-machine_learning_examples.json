        "readme": "machine_learning_examples\n=========================\n\nA collection of machine learning examples and tutorials.\n\nFind associated tutorials at https://lazyprogrammer.me\n\nFind associated courses at https://deeplearningcourses.com\n\nPlease note that not all code from all courses will be found in this repository. Some newer code examples (e.g. most of Tensorflow 2.0) were done in Google Colab. Therefore, you should check the instructions given in the lectures for the course you are taking.\n\n\nHow to I find the code for a particular course?\n===============================================\n\nThe code for each course is separated by folder. You can determine which folder corresponds with which course by watching the \"Where to get the code\" lecture inside the course (usually Lecture 2 or 3).\n\nRemember: one folder = one course.\n\n\nWhy you should not fork this repo\n=================================\n\nI've noticed that many people have out-of-date forks. Thus, I recommend not forking this repository if you take one of my courses. I am constantly updating my courses, and your fork will soon become out-of-date. You should clone the repository instead to make it easy to get updates (i.e. just \"git pull\" randomly and frequently).\n\n\nWhere is the code for your latest courses?\n==========================================\n\nBeginning with Tensorflow 2, I started to use Google Colab. For those courses, unless otherwise noted, the code will be on Google Colab. Links to the notebooks are provided in the course. See the lecture \"Where to get the code\" for further details.\n\n\nVIP Course Links\n===================\n\n**Data Science: Transformers for Natural Language
