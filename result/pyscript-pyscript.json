It means Python\nnow runs anywhere a browser runs: desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet, or any other\nbrowser enabled device.\n\nTo start building, read the\n[Beginning PyScript tutorial](https://docs.pyscript.net/latest/beginning-pyscript/).\n\nFor example applications, see [here](https://pyscript.com/@examples).\n\nOther useful resources:\n\n-   Our [Home Page](https://pyscript.net/) as an open source project.\n-   The [official technical docs](https://docs.pyscript.net/).\n-   A [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PyScriptTV) with helpful videos\n    and community content.\n-   A free-to-use [online IDE](https://pyscript.com/) for trying PyScript.\n-   Our community [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/BYB2kvyFwm), to keep in\n    touch .\n\nEvery Tuesday at 15:30 UTC there is the _PyScript Community Call_ on zoom,\nwhere we can talk about PyScript development in the open. Most of the\nmaintainers regularly participate in the call, and everybody is welcome to\njoin. This meeting is recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel.\n\nEvery other Thursday at 16:00 UTC there is the _PyScript FUN_ call: the focus\nof this call is to share fun projects, goofy hacks or clever uses of PyScript.\nIt's a supportive, energetic and entertaining meeting. This meeting is also\nrecorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel.\n\nFor more details on how to join the calls and up to date schedule, consult the\nofficial calendar:\n\n-   [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=d3afdd81f9c132a8c8f3290f5cc5966adebdf61017fca784eef0f6be9fd519e0@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC) in UTC time;\n-   [iCal format](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/d3afdd81f9c132a8c8f3290f5cc5966adebdf61017fca784eef0f6be9fd519e0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor technical details of the code, please see the [README](core/README.md) in\nthe `core` directory.\n\nRead the [contributing guide](https://docs.pyscript.net/latest/contributing/)\nto learn about our development process, reporting bugs and improvements,\ncreating issues and asking questions.\n\nCheck out the [development process](https://docs.pyscript.net/latest/developers/)\ndocumentation for more information on how to setup your development environment.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe [PyScript organization governance](https://github.com/pyscript/governance)\nis documented in a separate repository.\n",
