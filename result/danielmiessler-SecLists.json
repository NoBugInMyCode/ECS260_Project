It's a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.\n\nThis project is maintained by [Daniel Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com/), [Jason Haddix](https://twitter.com/Jhaddix), [Ignacio Portal](https://github.com/ItsIgnacioPortal) and [g0tmi1k](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/).\n\n- - -\n\n<!--- details anchor -->\n\n### Repository details\n\nSize of a complete clone of SecLists is currently at `1.8 GB`\n\nCloning this repository should take 6-7 minutes at 5MB/s speeds.\n\n<!--- details anchor -->\n\n- - -\n\n### Install\n\n**Zip**\n\n```\nwget -c https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/archive/master.zip -O SecList.zip \\\n  && unzip SecList.zip \\\n  && rm -f SecList.zip\n```\n\n**Git (Small)**\n\n```\ngit clone --depth 1 \\\n  https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git\n```\n\n**Git (Complete)**\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git\n```\n\n**Kali Linux** ([Tool Page](https://www.kali.org/tools/seclists/))\n\n```\napt -y install seclists\n```\n\n**BlackArch** ([Tool Page](https://blackarch.org/tools.html))\n\n```\nsudo pacman -S seclists\n```\n\n- - -\n\n### Attribution\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md)\n\n- - -\n\n### Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n- - -\n\n### Similar Projects\n\n- [Assetnote Wordlists](https://wordlists.assetnote.io/)\n- [fuzz.txt](https://github.com/Bo0oM/fuzz.txt)\n- [FuzzDB](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb)\n- [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)\n- [Cook](https://github.com/giteshnxtlvl/cook)\n- [SamLists](https://github.com/the-xentropy/samlists)\n\n- - -\n\n### Licensing\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE).\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT_License-blue)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n<sup>NOTE: Downloading this repository is likely to cause a false-positive alarm by your anti-virus or anti-malware software, the filepath should be whitelisted.
