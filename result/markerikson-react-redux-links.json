Not quite \"awesome\", but hopefully useful as a starting point I can give to others.  Suggestions welcome.\n\nAnother important resource is the **Reactiflux community on Discord**, which has chat channels dedicated to discussion of React, Redux, and other related technologies.  There's always a number of people hanging out and answering questions, and it's a great place to ask questions and learn.  The invite link is at **https://www.reactiflux.com**.\n\nYou might also want to check out my categorized list of Redux-related addons, libraries, and utilities, at [Redux Ecosystem Links](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links).  Also see [Community Resources](community-resources.md) for links to other links lists, podcasts, and email newsletters.  Finally, I also keep a dev blog at [blog.isquaredsoftware.com](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com), where I write about React, Redux, Webpack, and more.\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n#### Getting Started\n- [Basic Concepts and Overviews](./basic-concepts.md)\n- [Community Resources](./community-resources.md)\n- [Javascript Resources](./javascript-resources.md)\n- [Git Resources and Tutorials](./git-resources.md)\n- [Node.js and NPM](./node-js-and-npm.md)\n- [Webpack Tutorials](./webpack-tutorials.md)\n- [Boilerplates and Starter Kits](./boilerplates-and-starter-kits.md)\n\n#### Basic Tutorials\n- [ES6 Features and Samples](./es6-features.md)\n- [React Tutorials](./react-tutorials.md)\n- [Flux Tutorials](./flux-tutorials.md)\n- [Redux Tutorials](./redux-tutorials.md)\n- [MobX Tutorials](./mobx-tutorials.md)\n\n#### Intermediate Concepts\n\n- [Using React with ES6](./using-react-with-es6.md)\n- [Functional Programming](./functional-programming.md)\n- [Immutable Data](./immutable-data.md)\n- [React/Redux Testing](./react-redux-testing.md)\n- [React Native](./react-native.md)\n- [React Tips and Techniques](./react-techniques.md)\n\n#### Advanced Topics\n\n- **Architecture and Structure**\n  - [Project Structure](./project-structure.md)\n  - [React Component Patterns](./react-component-patterns.md)\n  - [React Component Composition](./react-component-composition.md)\n  - [React State Management](./react-state-management.md)\n  - [React Architecture and Best Practices](./react-architecture.md)\n  - [Redux Architecture and Best Practices](./redux-architecture.md)\n  - [React/Redux Performance](./react-performance.md)\n  - [React Deployment](./react-deployment.md)\n- **React**:\n  - [React Implementation and Concepts](./react-implementation.md)\n  - [React and Forms](./react-forms.md)\n  - [React and AJAX](./react-ajax.md)\n  - [React Styling](./react-styling.md)\n  - [React Server Rendering](./react-server-rendering.md)\n  - [React and Routing](./react-routing.md)  \n- **Redux**\n  - [Redux Reducers and Selectors](./redux-reducers-selectors.md)\n  - [Redux Middleware](./redux-middleware.md)\n  - [Redux Side Effects](./redux-side-effects.md)\n  - [Redux UI Management](./redux-ui-management.md)\n  - [Redux Tips and Techniques](./redux-techniques.md)\n  - [Using Redux Without React](./redux-without-react.md)\n- **Other**\n  - [Webpack Advanced Techniques](./webpack-advanced-techniques.md)\n  - [Static Typing](./static-typing.md)\n\n\n#### Comparisons and Discussion\n- [React/Flux/Redux Pros, Cons, and Discussion](./pros-cons-discussion.md)\n- [Framework Comparisons](./framework-comparisons.md)\n\n\n\n## Recommended Learning Path\n\n**You should usually learn these technologies in the following order:**\n\n1.  **\"How Web Apps Work\":** a series of posts that lays out the big picture of the core technologies, terms, and concepts used in client/server web apps\n2.  **JavaScript:** If you don't know JavaScript, nothing else will make sense\n3.  **React:** You can use React by itself, or with Redux and/or TypeScript. Learning it separately will minimize the number of new concepts and syntax you have to learn at once.\n4.  **Redux:** Redux can be used separately, but it's most commonly used with React.\n5.  **TypeScript:** Because it adds static types on top of JS, you need to understand JS first. Also, it's easiest to understand React and Redux first, _then_ learn how to use them with static types.\n\nThe resources in this page are listed in that order.\n\n**You are not required to read every single link and article listed in this page.** However, you should try to read through as many of the articles linked in the \"Recommended Primary Resources\" sections as possible, especially for topics you are not already familiar with. Many of the recommended tutorials do cover the same topics, so feel free to skip past concepts you've already learned.\n\nLinks in the \"Additional Resources\" sections are available as references and reading as needed.\n\n### How Web Apps Work\n\nMark's post series that describes the key terms, concepts, technologies, syntax, and data flow used in web apps.\n\n#### Recommended Primary Resources (should read)\n\n- [How Web Apps Work: HTTP and Servers](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/11/how-web-apps-work-http-server/)\n- [How Web Apps Work: Client Development and Deployment](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/11/how-web-apps-work-client-dev-deployment/)\n- [How Web Apps Work: Browsers, HTML, and CSS](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/11/how-web-apps-work-html-css/)\n- [How Web Apps Work: JavaScript and the DOM](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/11/how-web-apps-work-javascript-dom/)\n- [How Web Apps Work: AJAX, APIs, and Data Transfer](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/11/how-web-apps-work-ajax-apis-data/)\n\n### Javascript\n\n#### Recommended Primary Resources (should read)\n\n##### General JS\n\n- **Slides:** [Mark's \"JavaScript for Java Developers\" slides](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2019/05/presentation-js-for-java-devs/)\n- **Read:** [MDN: A re-introduction to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)\n- **Read:** [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)\n- **Read:** [Javascript Cheatsheet](https://javascript.pythoncheatsheet.org/)\n- **Exercises:** [CodeCademy -

The React team is in the process of starting a major rewrite of the React docs site to focus on teaching function components and hooks first, which is now available in beta.
