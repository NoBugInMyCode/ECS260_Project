Please visit [rockylinux.org](https://rockylinux.org) for current information about Rocky Linux**\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<i>\"Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh. He is no longer with us, so as a H/T to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you...Rocky Linux\"</i><br>\n\u2014 Gregory Kurtzer, Founder\n</p>\n\n## About\n\nRocky Linux is a community enterprise Operating System designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Enterprise Linux, now that CentOS has shifted direction.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n> **Q:** What do you mean, \"CentOS has shifted direction?\"\n\nThe CentOS project [recently announced](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/) a shift in strategy for CentOS. Whereas previously CentOS existed as a *downstream* build of its upstream vendor (it receives patches and updates after the upstream vendor does), it will be shifting to an *upstream* build (testing patches and updates *before* inclusion in the upstream vendor).\n\nAdditionally, support for CentOS Linux 8 has been cut short, from May 31, 2029 to December 31, 2021.\n\n> **Q:** So where does Rocky Linux come in?\n\nRocky Linux aims to function as a downstream build as CentOS had done previously, building releases after they have been added to the upstream vendor, not before.\n\n> **Q:** When will it be released?\n\nRelease is planned for Q2 2021.\n\n> **Q:** What is the vision for Rocky Linux?\n\nA **solid**, **stable**, and **transparent** alternative for production environments, developed *by* the community *for* the community.\n\n> **Q:** Who drives Rocky Linux?\n\nWe all do, Rocky Linux is a community-driven project and always will be. Rocky Linux will not be sold or driven by corporate interest.\n\n> **Q:** How can I get involved?\n\nPlease view the [contributing](#contributing) section below.\n\n## Contact\n\n| Team                          | Contact                                   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Press                         | community@rockylinux.org                   |\n| Development                   | development@rockylinux.org                |\n| Infrastructure                | infrastructure@rockylinux.org             |\n| Security                      | security@rockylinux.org                   |\n| Web and Branding              | web@rockylinux.org, brand@rockylinux.com  |\n\n\nFor all other questions: hello@rockylinux.org\n\n## Stay Informed\n\n* [Mattermost](https://chat.rockylinux.org)\n* [Forum](https://forums.rockylinux.org/)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/rocky-linux/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rocky_linux)\n* [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rockylinux)\n* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RockyLinux)\n* [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/+rockylinux:matrix.org)\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing to the project.\n\nIf you are a developer, architect, engineer, or otherwise looking to contribute your time and expertise, please consider joining the [Mattermost](https://chat.rockylinux.org) and jumping into the most relevant channel to your interests.\n\nIf you are interested in donating or sponsoring the project, please email donations@rockylinux.org or sponsor@rockylinux.org respectively.\n\n**NOTE**: We **do not** currently have any official crowdsourcing established.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nWe would like to thank the following groups for their support thus far on the project:\n* [Ctrl IQ, Inc.](https://www.ctrliq.com)\n* [The OSU Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org/)\n* [Clouvider](https://www.clouvider.co.uk/)\n* [SpryServers](https://www.spryservers.net/)\n* [FMI Groupe](https://www.fmi.fr/)\n",
